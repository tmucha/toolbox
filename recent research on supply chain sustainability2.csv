Rangelands,"• Sustainable beef is a socially responsible, environmentally sound, and economically viable product that prioritizes planet, people, animals, and progress. Beef sustainability requires awareness of the complex relationships among these three pillars. • In practice, sustainability to beef farmers and ranchers is about taking care of the animals, land, and water, while being a good neighbor and community member, and maintaining profitability. The beef industry has made improvements across these three areas of sustainability, in all sectors of the industry, from the cow-calf level to the packer phase. • The removal of beef cattle from grazing lands would effectively eliminate the beef industry, which would have a ripple effect on other industries that serve as input suppliers across the beef supply chain, while also eliminating critical social, economic, and environmental services provided by grazing cattle. • We describe the science on the economic, social, and environmental benefits of grazing cattle on grazing lands, and discuss the sustainability impacts of eliminating the beef industry in the U.S.","Oerly A., Johnson M., Soule J.","Economic, social, and environmental impacts of cattle on grazing land ecosystems",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123621891&doi=10.1016%2fj.rala.2021.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=5f0a7ab40feb3c8b0a470c65aa529335
Environmental Footprints and Eco-Design of Products and Processes,"A blockchain can be thought of as the shared distributed ledger type of technology that stores the information of every transaction in its network. The blockchain has emerged with vast diversity of applications in the economical and non-economical areas. Blockchain technology has the potential to provide a robust span of solutions to the issues faced in the implementation of smart cities. As such, it displays the potential to create smart types of contracts more securely, by eliminating the need for centralized authority. A blockchain can be envisioned as a secure decentralized database that stores information utilizing a peer-to-peer type of network. The blockchain can be seen as a type of special stack, where blocks could be placed or stacked on top of each other. Subsequent blocks composing the blockchain have to be linked to each other by cryptographic type of hash. In contemporary times an increasing interest in the concept of blockchain technology has been observed. This secondary research utilizes detailed literature review of multifaceted sources of information, such as peer-reviewed and quality academic journal articles from renowned databases. With the introduction of blockchain, numerous fields like banking, finance, healthcare, and supply chain shall experience positive effects. The sustainability of smart cities can be further enhanced and ensured with the application of blockchain technology. One major aspect wherein blockchain can play an essential role is real estate and smart cities. Blockchain and Smart Cities concepts are fated to influence the future of our planet in numerous ways. Incorporating blockchain into the expansion of Smart Cities will make it possible to have a cross-cutting platform that connects the cities’ different services, adding greater transparency and security to all services and processes.","Riđić O., Jukić T., Riđić G., Mangafić J., Bušatlić S., Karamehić J.","“Implementation of Blockchain Technologies in Smart Cities, Opportunities and Challenges”",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117941607&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-6301-7_4&partnerID=40&md5=6bf6cf5ecb698c8da5072765704192ae
Sustainable Futures,"A blood supply chain (BSC) is a very long and complex sequence of processes heavily sequential. If one of them is executed in an incorrect way and this error is not detected, it leads to an incorrect transfusion outcome, that could seriously affect patients. For this reason, there is a strong need to identify and prevent adverse events along the entire BSC, in order to reduce their probability of occurrence. This also helps improving BSC sustainability from both the environmental and the social perspectives. The paper extends an existing healthcare supply chain risk management framework already applied to the blood transfusion process to address multiple BSC echelons and identify the cause and effect relationships among the adverse events that might occur. To this end, Fault Tree Analysis is added to the risk management tools part of the original framework as well as Key Performance Indicators are applied to detect risky event manifestation. The first application of the proposed approach to a blood bank and a hospital ward revealed its effectiveness in identifying the BSC activities most subjected to risk. Also, connections between adverse events and causal relationships among their sources were found, leading to understanding whether an adverse event is caused by a risk source in the same echelon where it occurs or by the concurrent manifestation of several adverse events upstream in the BSC. Future research will be devoted to numerically evaluate probability of occurrence and impact of risky events as well as integrating the framework with a classification of criticalities based on their severity.","Cagliano A.C., Grimaldi S., Rafele C., Campanale C.",An enhanced framework for blood supply chain risk management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135876368&doi=10.1016%2fj.sftr.2022.100091&partnerID=40&md5=3782ef3e700ca801af46dc4ec646e9ae
Sustainability (Switzerland),"A business organization needs a supply chain performance management system (SCPMS) to build an effective and efficient supply chain (SC) that will provide much-needed sustainability. The performance evaluation of supply chain management (SCM) is difficult and needs consideration of several important enablers. In such situations, the development of an SCPMS can facilitate understanding and integration among the SC partners. The SCPMS is influenced by many enablers that play a positive role; hence, the study of these enablers becomes significant. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify and rank the key SCPMS enablers. The identified SCPMS enablers were modeled using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and ranked through an interpretative ranking process (IRP). The SCPMS enablers were further categorized using MICMAC. The results show that “SCPMS awareness”, “top management commitment”, and “financial commitment towards SCPMS” must be controlled for sustainability as they are independent enablers. “Benchmarking”, “appropriate performance matrix”, and “employee commitment” were the three top enablers.",Qureshi M.R.N.M.,Evaluating and Prioritizing the Enablers of Supply Chain Performance Management System (SCPMS) for Sustainability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138897438&doi=10.3390%2fsu141811296&partnerID=40&md5=1b29eb65365e004733c6f6a87c9d889c
"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","A circular economy (CE) aims to decouple human activities from economic activities and resource use, and its overall goal is reducing or avoiding negative environmental externalities. The newly developed Circular Economy Lifecycle Assessment and Visualization (CELAVI) framework simulates changes in supply chain environmental impacts as it transitions toward circularity. This study expands CELAVI by incorporating detailed spatial resolution and real-world road routes connecting all facilities within the system. The case study on end-of-life decision making of wind turbine blades in the states of Iowa and Missouri explores how supply chain circularity and environmental impacts are affected by pathway costs and level of wind turbine installations. It demonstrates how high circularity costs might be beneficial for circularity transitions given revenue generated from circular pathways. Finally, impacts have important contributions to the supply chain design and thus show the importance of including detailed spatial resolution in CELAVI and CE studies in general.","Ghosh T., Hanes R., Key A., Walzberg J., Eberle A.",The Circular Economy Life Cycle Assessment and Visualization Framework: A Multistate Case Study of Wind Blade Circularity in United States,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133947061&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2022.106531&partnerID=40&md5=a70ee669280ea164cfe1012c6abe5ea5
Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,"A circular economy (CE) is increasingly recognized as a more environmentally sustainable alternative to the dominant linear take-make-dispose economic model. We empirically investigate the effect of circular supply chain management (CSCM) on cost and financial performance in China, which has established the world's largest system of eco-industrial parks (EIPs) to promote CE over the last decade. We combine the Natural Resource-Based View (NRBV), Contingent NRBV and the literature on CSCM to develop a conceptual model and test it using survey data collected from 255 Chinese manufacturing firms. The results show that CSCM, when exercised as a unified strategy, has a significant positive effect on cost and financial performance. Firms located within EIPs adopt CSCM at higher levels as compared to firms located outside EIPs. Nevertheless, the contextual factor of being located within an EIP does not moderate the CSCM practice-performance relationship, suggesting that performance is driven by practices rather than firms’ locations. These results were affirmed by post-survey participant validation in three focus group meetings and six face-to-face interviews. Our findings contribute to sustainability literature by offering a new construct and measurement items relevant to CSCM and provide practical insights to guide a transition to a CE.","Farooque M., Zhang A., Liu Y., Hartley J.L.",Circular supply chain management: Performance outcomes and the role of eco-industrial parks in China,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121905946&doi=10.1016%2fj.tre.2021.102596&partnerID=40&md5=83900425876ae7e66fc84c576171a963
Journal of Cleaner Production,"A circular supply chain consists of emission and wastes minimization technologies with a remarkable gain in profit, which is the aim of any industry that is concerned about environmental conservation. One of the most critical hurdles to the transition to sustainability is waste management. This study proposes a circular sustainable integrated model in a plastic reforming industry with investment in 3D printing techniques to minimize waste, emission reduction, and ordering cost reduction and it led to optimal profit. The customer's demand and the unit profit depend on the circularity index of the item. This paper looked at three scenarios with partial backlogging: (a) linear demand versus linear unit profit; (b) linear demand versus exponential unit profit; and (c) linear demand versus logistic unit profit. An algorithm was used to optimize the profit of the plastic reforming industry with optimal values of ordering quantity, circularity index, and investment in waste minimization, emission reduction, and ordering cost under carbon cap policy. This model establishes that the plastic reforming industry will get more profit and an optimal level of circularity index when it works with high efficiency of emission and waste minimization technologies under low investment, a rise in the carbon tax, and less opportunity cost. Sensitivity analysis and managerial framework in the plastic reforming industry were given to realize the sensitivity of decision variables with variation in key parameters.","Thomas A., Mishra U.",A sustainable circular economic supply chain system with waste minimization using 3D printing and emissions reduction in plastic reforming industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125649141&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.131128&partnerID=40&md5=bd7cbc258ebe9945b96e530bef88db17
Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"A digital twin is an integration of virtual and physical systems using disruptive technologies. More precisely, it is a method of developing sustainable, intelligent manufacturing systems for attaining robust quality, reducing time, and customized products using real-time information throughout the product life cycle. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 98 research papers on various digital supply chain twin dimensions with sustainable performance objectives. The selected papers were reviewed and classified into three broad categories: components of the digital twin, applications in the manufacturing supply chain, and sustainability. Based on the review and future perspectives from the study, we suggest that advancements in technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and blockchain have increased the potential of digital twin applications in the supply chain. The results indicate that a digital supply chain twin should include the things and humans from the entire supply chain and not be restricted to the local manufacturing systems.

Electronics (Switzerland),"A food shortage, which has increased with the climate crisis, will be one of the biggest problems of the world, together with water scarcity, in the future and will damage the sustainability of the food supply system. With the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, food resources are decreasing, and food prices are rising all over the world. The decrease in food sources increases the importance of food tracking even more. The exorbitant price increases after the COVID-19 pandemic are the most concrete indicators of this. Blockchain-based food tracking systems will be of critical importance because they will prevent exorbitant price increases with their contribution to food tracking processes, such as reliability and transparency. In this study, the establishment of a blockchain-based food tracking system in Turkey, its operation, and its results will be discussed. It was concluded that 97.54% of the participants using the established system found the application useful and wanted such an application to become widespread.

Frontiers in Environmental Science,"A low-carbon supply chain is generally a clean practice to achieve carbon peak and neutralization; it transforms supply chain management into a green economy, aiming to reduce energy consumption, reduce pollution and achieve sustainable development in all parts of the supply chain. However, there are few specific reviews of low-carbon supply chains to date. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature on low-carbon supply chains, explores the current knowledge system, evolution trend of topics, and future research directions, and enriches the green economy framework. A systematic analysis was conducted using bibliometric and content analysis. Up to 1,811 articles from 2003 to 2021 were selected, discussed, and analyzed. This study found that the low carbon supply chain is a growing research topic. Some influential authors, the geographical distribution of articles, and subject categories in this field were also identified. Next, five clusters, which are logistics management, carbon accounting, driving forces, sustainability management, and barriers, were defined using exhaustive content analysis. The evolution trend of significant topics, mainly including global value chain, additive manufacturing, deterioration, and decarbonization, was explored.

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"A massive increase in the use and production of masks worldwide has been seen in the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has contributed to reducing the transmission of the virus globally. This paper aims to evaluate the life cycle environmental impacts of disposable medical masks to identify the life cycle stages that cause the highest impact on the environment. A further goal is to estimate the total environmental impacts at the global level in 2020. The inventory data was constructed directly from the industry. The system boundary of the study is from cradle to grave comprising raw material extraction and processing, production, packaging, distribution, use, and disposal as well as transport and waste management along the supply chain. Eleven environmental impacts have been estimated. The results suggest that the global warming potential of a disposable medical mask is 0.02 g CO2-eq. for which the main contributor is the raw material supply (40.5%) followed by the packaging (30.0%) and production (15.5%).

Processes,"A selection of suitable sustainability management systems (SMS) is a major part of supply chain strategies to create a competitive advantage, reduce total costs, and manage long-term sustainability. A framework and method for prioritizing supply chain SMSs are presented in this research. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is the most common method for alternative selection in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). However, complex information is mixed with ambiguity and uncertainty, which makes decision makers unable to use precise or crisp numbers, so fuzzy numbers are presented to remedy this difficulty. Therefore, this research proposes a fuzzy additive preference programming (FAPP) to select the optimum SMS for a supply chain. FAPP method can produce the unique normalized optimal priority vector of fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices for SMS selection effectively with linear constraints. The additive linear constraints can eliminate the weaknesses of existing methods and equalize the upper and lower triangular fuzzy judgments. In addition, the proposed method can identify abnormal pairs of fuzzy judgments that cause inconsistency. The proposed methodology can prioritize the key criteria which lead to the selection of the most appropriate SMS. An example of SMS selection in a rubber factory demonstrates the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.","Panjavongroj S., Phruksaphanrat B.",Selection of Supply Chain Sustainability Management System by Fuzzy Additive Preference Programming Method,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132587032&doi=10.3390%2fpr10061189&partnerID=40&md5=d2349f958cb8498a0d8d8e11ea7b7ab0
Strategic Change,"A sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI) in the leather-making process is key for inducing a sustainable shift in the leather supply chain. Fashion is an industry that is highly vulnerable to sustainability disruptions and, at the same time, as a fertile ground for SOIs. As a result of increasing pressures from the market, several fashion brands have started to recognize the potential of SOIs to induce a positive transformation for the whole supply chain. The present paper discusses the case of a SOI in the leather industry by analyzing the perception of different actors in the leather-accessories supply chain with three theoretical lenses. Findings suggest that focal companies should pay attention to how to manage their business relationships with supply chain actors and leverage positive and collaborative relationships rather than using coercive methods to extend sustainability along the supply chain.","Brun A., Ciccullo F.",Factors affecting sustainability-oriented innovation in the leather supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129365415&doi=10.1002%2fjsc.2500&partnerID=40&md5=e751bfbdf89d8376fb80997939af6d52
Sustainability (Switzerland),"A sustainable food system is a key target of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The current global food system operates on market mechanisms that prioritise profit maximisation. This paper examines how small food businesses grow and develop within grassroot economies that operate on different market mechanisms. Focusing on artisan food producers and farmers’ markets, this research highlights the potential of resilient, small-scale, diverse markets as pathways to sustainable food systems. An applied critical realist, mixed-methods study was conducted at a macro (Irish food industry), meso (farmers’ markets in the region of Munster, Ireland) and micro (artisan food producers and their businesses) level. The resulting framework provides a post-growth perspective to sustainability, proposing that farmers’ markets represent an alternative market structure to the dominant industrial market, organised on mechanisms where producers ‘Mind what they make’ and ‘Make peace with enough’. In their resilience, these markets can provide pathways for structural change. This implies a call to action to reorientate policies targeting small food businesses to move beyond the concept of firms as profit-maximizing enterprises and to instead focus on a local food policy framework that reinforces the regional ‘interstices’ within which small food businesses operate to promote diversity, resilience and sustainability in the food system.","Connolly R., Bogue J., Repar L.",Farmers’ Markets as Resilient Alternative Market Structures in a Sustainable Global Food System: A Small Firm Growth Perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138749780&doi=10.3390%2fsu141811626&partnerID=40&md5=080df5bd151d1eb79a1f6b6cad2013ba

Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems,"A sustainable supply chain (SSC) is vital for company's sustainability success, so it is imperative to identify and prioritize SSC's design requirements (DRs) for better SSC planning. For customer-centric markets, the customer requirements (CRs) need to be integrated into SSC's DRs. This paper thus proposes a customer-centric approach based on Analytic Network Process (ANP), Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), and Pythagorean Fuzzy Set (PFS) to rank SSC's DRs, considering CRs and information ambiguity. The PFS is combined with ANP, QFD, and GRA to better handle uncertainty in the SSC. The Pythagorean fuzzy ANP is applied to analyze the correlations among the sustainable CRs and determine the corresponding weights. The sustainable CRs are transformed into the DRs using the Pythagorean fuzzy QFD. The relationships among the resulting DRs are analyzed through Pythagorean fuzzy GRA to prioritize DRs. The approach is validated through a case study. The results obtained in this paper shows that the proposed method is efficient to prioritize DRs of SSC with the consideration of sustainable CRs under uncertain environment. The novelties of proposed method are that it not only offers a customer-oriented SSC planning method through the integration of ANP, QFD and GRA, but also can reflect the uncertain information with a broader membership representation space via PFSs. Based on the proposed method, the decision-maker can conduct comprehensive analysis to prioritize DRs and design appropriate SSC to fulfill CRs under uncertain environment.","Peng Z., He L., Xie Y., Song W., Liu J., Ming X., Goh M.",A Pythagorean fuzzy ANP-QFD-Grey relational analysis approach to prioritize design requirements of sustainable supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127434041&doi=10.3233%2fJIFS-212131&partnerID=40&md5=4781f7c06b294c6766d1777ca22d701d
Resources Policy,"A sustained and guaranteed supply of rare earth (RE) minerals is imperative to a country's national security to sustain its manufacturing, defence, and high-tech industry sectors. Although the term is referring to “rare”, it does not mean that they are not abundant, but rather the difficulties to extract these minerals and the highly mixed nature of the deposits make them rare. RE minerals' production has been closely monopolised by Chinese mining companies which have create concerns on their supply risk and resilience in the future. This study critically reviewed 1) the existing approaches and theories used to evaluate the RE supply security and 2) the pathways to achieve RE supply security and their existing drivers and barriers to implementation. Literature and reports were collected from Web of Science, Scopus, and Google search which resulted in 323 articles included in the final database and 67 articles for the critical analysis. Our findings indicate the need to integrate existing approaches and theories such as resilience, material criticality, and risk theory to overcome their individual limitations.

ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"A third of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are attributable to the food sector, however dietary change could reduce this by half. Educating consumers on the environmental impact of their choices through eco-labels as a form of sustainability signalling may be a powerful approach to tackling climate change if it can bring about a large scale transition in households and supply chains.

Building Research and Information,"A transition to a circular economy (CE) is a sociotechnical phenomenon that relies on adopting innovative methods and technologies, as well as changes in behaviour across the construction supply chain. Although a lot of ground has been covered on developing methods and technologies, there is little research on stakeholders’ change of behaviour. Informed by an underlying framework, the theory of planned behaviour, a comprehensive literature review discusses several conceptual models to establish the interrelationships between barriers and drivers to managing a transition to CE–and their underlying causes. The findings offer a comprehensive point of reference for identifying factors that affect CE adoption, and lay a solid foundation for future research into CE adoption and managing a CE transition where the intermediate theories presented can be validated through empirical research.","Adabre M.A., Chan A.P.C., Darko A., Hosseini M.R.",Facilitating a transition to a circular economy in construction projects: intermediate theoretical models based on the theory of planned behaviour,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129265912&doi=10.1080%2f09613218.2022.2067111&partnerID=40&md5=11b869c406268525cdd49deca6086e1e

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Abstract: Although the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global supply chains, it also provided opportunities that brought the concepts of sustainability and green practices back into the light. Based on the “stakeholders” and “social cognitive” theory, our study intends to empirically explore how fear-uncertainty towards COVID-19 relates positively to both green supply chain management (GSCM) and the firm’s sustainability performance (economic, environmental, and social). In addition, it examines the moderating effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) (internal CSR and external CSR) on the association between fear-uncertainty towards COVID-19 and GSCM. In this study, we studied a sample of 300 manager-level employees in Egypt. We used partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data and test our hypotheses. Results showed that fear-uncertainty towards COVID-19 positively affect GSCM. Also, external CSR moderates the association among fear-uncertainty towards COVID-19 and GSCM. But it is not moderated by internal CSR. In addition, GSCM positively affects environmental and social performance. However, it has an insignificant effect on economic performance. Besides, GSCM has a significant mediation effect between fear-uncertainty towards COVID-19 and the firm’s environmental and social performance. However, this mediation relationship regarding economic performance is insignificant. Finally, we discussed the theoretical and practical implications at the end of this research.

Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,"Abstract: Due to growing public awareness, governmental regulations and concerns, environmental sustainability initiatives have received increasing attention among industrial decision-makers and practitioners. Employing environmental management programs can significantly minimize the waste and preserve the environment. However, papers have not much focused on exploring the interactions and interdependencies among environmental sustainability innovation factors, particularly in the context of manufacturing sector of emerging economies. To address this issue, this paper proposes a criteria decision framework, with the target of investigating the interactions among environmental sustainability innovation criteria within an emerging economy nation manufacturing sector context using Z-based DEMATEL technique. According to the findings, “designing products for being reusable and energy-efficient” is the most critical criterion and requires a considerable attention for successfully implementing environmental sustainability innovation.

Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,"Abstract: This article addresses a gap in knowledge of peoples’ strategies and recommendations concerning power production and achieving reductions in GHGs to address climate change. Employing mixed methods, two-day deliberative focus groups in three communities in Saskatchewan, Canada included pre and post-focus group surveys, coding and analysis of discussions, and the creation of consensus recommendations for sustainable power production in the future. These innovative mixed-methods provide insights into how to advance individual and social learning. Results of comparative case study analysis provide strong support for renewables and illustrate place-based differences. All communities supported renewable sources. The community in proximity to coal, oil, and gas production supported coal, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and was concerned with the social cost of job loss on the welfare system; engaging the public was not a priority. In contrast, the other two communities stressed the importance of engaging the public and considering all costs, risks, benefits across the entire lifespan of power production sources. To achieve future sustainability, policy implications include addressing important concerns of resource-dependent communities, namely job loss, and conducting holistic policy assessment of potential power production sources that account for carbon and cost across the entire supply chain and include land-use change.

Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,"Abstract: This study develops a novel mathematical modelling framework for biomass combined heat and power systems (CHP) that links biomass and process characteristics to sustainability assessment of the life cycle. A total of twenty-nine indicators for the process (four-indicators), economic (five-indicators), environmental (eight-indicators) and social global (five-indicators) and local (seven-indicators) aspects have been analysed for sustainability. These are technological: biomass throughput, electricity and steam generations and CHP efficiency; economic: internal rate of return, capital, operating and feedstock costs and cost of production; environmental: global warming, fossil, land and water use, acidification, urban smog, eutrophication and ecotoxicity potentials; social (global): labour rights and decent work, health &amp; safety, human rights, governance and community infrastructure; social (local): total forest land, direct/indirect jobs, gender equality and energy-water-sanitation access for communities, from biomass characteristics (carbon and hydrogen contents), energy demands and economic parameters. This paper applies the developed methodology to a case study in Mexico. From 12.47 kt/year forestry residue, 1 MWe is generated with an associated low-pressure steam generation of 50 kt/year, at the cost of production of $0.023/kWh.

Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing,"According to a new study by the International Labor Organization (ILO), the COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on the garment industry in the Asia-Pacific region. A sharp drop in retail sales in key export markets has affected workers and businesses across supply chains. To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of garment supply chain, choosing a sustainable supplier should be a main concern of all businesses. The supplier selection problem in garment industry involves multiple quantitative and qualitative criteria. There have been many research and literatures about the development and application of Multicri-teria Decision Making (MCDM) models in solving decision-making problems in different industry sectors such as supplier selection or investment assessment. Many different MCDM models have been introduced over the years, and each model is uniquely dedicated into solving a particular problem. There is very little MCDM models incorporated with fuzzy set theory to support decision makers with decision-making problem in uncertain environments. This paper introduces a Fuzzy MCDM-based approach to the problem by utilizing Fuzzy-Analytic Hier-archical Process (FAHP) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) methods to support the decision makers. The aim of the paper is developing a decision-making tool that supports the decision maker in deciding the suitable supplier in garment industry under fuzzy environment. The proposed MCDM model is applied to a real-world case study to demonstrate the application steps of the model as well as its feasibility. The model assisted in successfully its proposed goals that resulted in an optimal supplier in garment industry.","Kao J.-C., Wang C.-N., Nguyen V.T., Husain S.T.",A fuzzy mcdm model of supplier selection in supply chain management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118611687&doi=10.32604%2fIASC.2022.021778&partnerID=40&md5=5472562aa60bf7dbc5c2709def55d15e
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Achieving a circular economy (CE) has become a strategic priority for the plastic packaging industry to implement long-term business sustainability while meeting legislative requirements. In this view, the evolution of circularity practices in relation to technological, regulatory, and socio-economic factors and the implications for different value chain actors are open streams of research. This study aims to assess trends and meaningful changes in the adoption of circularity practices from the perspective of different value chain actors, under the effects of leading CE barriers and enablers. A longitudinal analysis of the influence of these factors in relation to CE practices adopted by the Italian plastic packaging sector was conducted for the years 2011, 2015, and 2019. The involvement in plastic recovery became a predominant CE strategy over time, thanks to technological availability and a more mature regulatory framework. Our results suggest a gradual shift from scattered CE implementations to a more systemic approach to CE integrating upstream and downstream solutions. However, this transition occurred at different speeds and levels across the supply chain, as companies perceived factors differently and, consequently, implemented different types of CE practices. Therefore, increased collaboration and alignment across the supply chain are still required to overcome existing challenges. Based on our analysis, a focus group with stakeholders and experts of the plastic industry drew possible future avenues for the plastic packaging sector. Suggested priority actions include advancement of new and emerging recycling technologies, prioritization of economically viable and closed-loop alternatives to recover plastic waste, and alignment between national and international CE directives. These results extend our understanding of the CE transition and shed new light on the ways in which the industry can address existing barriers in different tiers for a system-wide impact.","Maione C., Lapko Y., Trucco P.",Towards a circular economy for the plastic packaging sector: Insights from the Italian case,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138783758&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.09.002&partnerID=40&md5=73a22785fc31dccd1624328f5d9e1775

High P fertilizer use for crop production in China was accompanied by high P-related environmental pressure that was highly spatially heterogeneous, with hotspots in North China. In addition, crop production in the P supply chain was responsible for 94.2% and 57.2% of water eutrophication and global warming potentials.

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Achieving transparency of the social and environmental impacts of industrial production poses significant obstacles for companies operating in complex global supply chains. They often do not possess sufficient information of other actors, especially at lower tiers in the supply chain. In recent years, data collection and information exchange in industry has been increasingly assisted by digital technologies, coining the term Industry 4.0. However, it remains largely unknown how companies try to foster transparency in their supply chains and how digital technologies are utilized for this purpose. In this study, we employ a qualitative, interview-based approach from both buyers’ and suppliers’ perspectives to investigate practices of supplier sustainability assessments in the electronics industry as well as their current and envisioned utilization of digital technologies. With regard to the exchange of sustainability-related information, we find that buying firms do not consistently check for the availability of digital interfaces to suppliers. Systematic and well-structured collection of such data is rare in suppliers, relying on manual self-assessments and lacking the means of automated data collection. This poses difficulties for buying firms to ensure validity of sustainability performance claims, highlighted by the fact that not all buying firms analyze suppliers’ self-assessments. To overcome such issues, ongoing industry-wide efforts of standardizing sustainability requirements should be extended to include strategic considerations of streamlining technology implementation to enhance data availability and validity.","Matthess M., Kunkel S., Xue B., Beier G.",Supplier sustainability assessment in the age of Industry 4.0 – Insights from the electronics industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129423608&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2022.100038&partnerID=40&md5=b753a75b90c23120dbbca96b5f6e6eeb
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Adaptation and mitigation to the adverse impacts of rising weather and climate extremes require businesses to respond with adequate marketing strategies promoting sustained economic development. Unfortunately, the connections exploring such relationships have not been extensively investigated in the current body of literature. This study investigated the five marketing categories relating to sustainable practices (sustainable marketing, social marketing, green marketing, sustainable consumption and ecological marketing) within core research themes of climate change, global warming and sustainability from a bibliometric approach using the Scopus API. Additional topic modelling was conducted using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) unsupervised approach on downloaded abstracts to distinguish ideas communicated in time through research and publications with co-occurrences of major Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports and Google search queries. The results confirmed marketing strategies aligned with the theme of sustainability with little work from small developing island nations. Additionally, findings demonstrated that research exploring business strategies through green marketing directed to green consumers with sustainable supply chain management had been dominantly increasing in the literature over recent years. Similarly, social marketing associated with green consumers was a common concern for the public and academics, rising over the years with strong influence from the published IPCC Assessment Reports.

Procedia CIRP,"Additive manufacturing (AM) has long been recognized as a revolutionary technology. Throughout the last years, the number of applications of AM technologies has been growing, with a particular focus on the medical and aeronautical fields. Only recently have researchers and practitioners started to perceive the potential of AM in industrial maintenance, particularly in spare parts manufacturing. By allowing toolless manufacturing, and large design freedom, AM technologies can be used to produce spare parts ""on-demand"", thus contributing to the elimination of costly/unnecessary stock. This notion of stocking 3d files instead of physical parts is often referred to in the literature as ""digital warehouse"", and it is highly aligned with the principals of industry 4.0. The expected benefits are obviously focused on reducing costs, however, there are potential environmental and social gains to be achieved as a result of decentralizing manufacturing, reducing transport, and distributing labor. The main challenge lies on operationalizing this practice and understanding the full impact it will have on supply-chains, particularly in the people directly/indirectly affected (social aspects) and the overall environmental footprint (environmental aspects). While the potential benefits are relatively well documented both the from economic and to some extent environmental perspectives, changing manufacturing and supply-chain paradigms, will have a fundamental impact on the supply chain and everyone involved. To study these changes, this paper focuses on creating, presenting, and evaluating a business model to facilitate the transition from physical to digital warehouses. The authors have chosen to use the Business Model Canvas for Sustainability (BMCS) and the adjacent assessment framework to compare the business model to current practices and evaluate its economic, environmental, and social sustainability.","Cardeal G., Ferreira B., Peças P., Leite M., Ribeiro I.",Designing Sustainable Business Models to Reduce Spare Part Inventory,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127528043&doi=10.1016%2fj.procir.2022.02.029&partnerID=40&md5=e43f93b0286753801887eff4bb53329e
International Journal of Production Economics,"Additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the technologies driving the shift to Industry 4.0. This transition reconfigures the supply chain to achieve the circular economy (CE) ideal along with improved resource efficiency. This study aims to explore how AM can be implemented in the CE context and to conceptualise the integration of AM and CE. The conceptual elements are identified through a systematic review and content analysis of the related literature, which consist of 51 journal articles. The content analysis was further enhanced by a contingency analysis and a causal loop diagram (CLD). The study highlights the role of the customer and the maturity of the technology as cornerstones when adopting AM in the CE context. Further, understanding the impact of manufacture location, the rapid prototyping legacy and workforce skill is crucial for achieving sustainability in the long run through AM implementation. Further, the contingency analysis reveals key constructs, which are grouped into five key clusters that need to be considered when implementing AM: (1) supply chain actors, (2) drivers, (3) key AM decisions, (4) CE implementation strategies and (5) operational practices. The CLD illustrates the interconnections between these five clusters, thereby revealing how key AM decisions and drivers mediate the influence exerted by CE implementation strategies and supply chain actors of AM on the operational practices. From a practical viewpoint, this study strives to realise the CE by proposing an elaborated guideline for practitioners to implement state-of-the-art AM technology.","Hettiarachchi B.D., Brandenburg M., Seuring S.","Connecting additive manufacturing to circular economy implementation strategies: Links, contingencies and causal loops",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123031197&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108414&partnerID=40&md5=84481e07784e83d320a7f53e8bab3a46
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Additive manufacturing (AM) is regarded as sustainability friendly thanks to its significantly reduced production steps and simplified supply chain at the system level, but it is often not energy efficient at the process level. In this study, we propose that the optimization of AM process parameters should not only maximize build quality, but also minimize environmental impact and build time. A multi-objective optimization problem of maximizing relative density (RD), minimizing energy consumption and build time per unit volume (ev and tv respectively) is formulated and solved for selective laser melting (SLM) of Inconel 718 alloy. A high accuracy RD prediction model with R2 of 93.23% is obtained by fitting SLM experiment data from wide ranges of laser power (P), scanning speed (SS), hatch spacing (HS), and layer thickness (LT). The ev and tv models are created considering printing area utilization rate (U) based on laser scanning and powder coating process. The two approaches of Pareto front and global criterion method are adopted for solving the multi-objective optimization problem. It is found that the highest RD of close to 100% can be obtained at the expense of high ev and tv of close to 500 J/mm3 and 0.3 s/mm3, respectively, and about three times ev and tv are needed to increase RD from about 95% to 100% than from 85% to 95%. At the same U level, the solutions obtained from prioritizing ev and tv are consistent, while those from prioritizing RD show smaller process parameter values. The multi-objective optimization formulation provides an enabling tool for industry to obtain high quality SLM-ed parts with improved sustainability and efficiency at the process level. The methodology developed is applicable to selective laser melting of other materials, and such consideration can be readily expanded to other AM processes as well.","Lu C., Shi J.","Simultaneous consideration of relative density, energy consumption, and build time for selective laser melting of Inconel 718: A multi-objective optimization study on process parameter selection",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135792460&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.133284&partnerID=40&md5=525dfc1ceebda4b7e7148dded64bb861

Business Strategy and the Environment,"Addressing environmental concerns in supply chain is a challenge, where one of the greatest difficulties is quantifying the environmental impacts. This quantification in abstract units is often done, but it does not always allow decision-makers to understand how their supply chains' influence the environment.

As main contributions, this paper supports the understanding of the methodological basis of the main monetization methods. This is then embedded into an optimization-based decision supporting tool that defines the design and planning of supply chain allowing to conclude on the most appropriate methods to used when considering supply chain environmental performance. From the results is also demonstrated how the different monetization methods can influence the supply chain design and planning. A set of main recommendations to decision-makers and researchers is provided that support the definition of supply chain strategy towards greener systems allowing the evolution of the currently practiced knowledge.","da Silva C., Barbosa-Póvoa A.P., Carvalho A.",Towards sustainable development: Green supply chain design and planning using monetization methods,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122083750&doi=10.1002%2fbse.2960&partnerID=40&md5=1d3e8870ee888de368606ff398ed6b5e
Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,"Adopted first by the City of Los Angeles in 2012, the Good Food Purchasing Program® creates a transparent supply chain and helps institutions to measure and then make shifts in their food purchases. It is the first procurement model to support five food system values—local economies, environmental sustainability, valued workforce, animal welfare and nutrition—in equal measure and thereby encourages myriad organizations to come together to engage for shared goals. Within just six years, the Good Food Purchasing Program has catalyzed a nationwide movement to establish similar policies in localities small and large across the United States, and inspired the creation of the Center for Good Food Purchasing. First adopted by the City of Los Angeles in 2012, it is a procurement standard that offers institutions a system in which current investments toward food are redirected toward more sustainable and fair suppliers. It uses a metric-based, flexible framework that produces a star rating. The Good Food Purchasing Program promotes the purchase of more sustainably produced food, from local economies, especially smaller and mid-sized farms and other food processing operations, which results in production returns at a more regional and local level, and ensures that suppliers' workers are offered safe and healthy working conditions and fair compensation, that livestock receives healthy and humane care, and that consumers—foremost school children, patients, the elderly—enjoy better health and well-being as a result of higher quality nutritious meals. This article will detail its implementation since 2012, provide current information on the impacts the Program has had on the agroecology of regions in the US food system, and recommendations for policy changes that could catalyze more accelerated impact.

In this study, our focus was to develop a framework for an Internet of things (IoT) embedded sustainable supply chain to deliver textile items using a B2B e-commerce business model. We formulated a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to minimize the total supply chain cost, including the B2B orders’ packaging, handling, and transportation, with carbon emission taxation. Furthermore, the purchasing cost of the RFID tags and IoT facilities that were provided on the transport vehicles was high. The proposed model was solved by using the global solver in the LINGO software package and finding the optimized value of the total supply chain network cost. We tested the proposed model in different case scenarios, i.e., small-to significant-sized problems. Then, a sensitivity analysis was performed to observe the variations in the overall cost of the supply chain network when there were changes in the main parameters of the proposed model.

However, the rapid spread of farmers' credit default behavior will seriously affect the stability of the agricultural supply chain and the wide application of agricultural supply chain finance. To prevent the rapid spread of farmers' credit default behavior, the diffusion mechanism of farmers' default behavior is studied with network evolutionary game. The results indicate the following: (a) When some farmers choose the default strategy because their default income is greater than their performance income, the default behavior in the small-world network will not spread to the whole network. However, in the scale-free network, when the default rate of return exceeds a certain threshold, it will lead to the spread of default behavior throughout the network. (b) In the small-world network, the spread of default will be inhibited to some extent with the increase of extra returns.

Central European Journal of Operations Research,"Agri-food production must increase while food waste needs to be reduced for improving the position of farmers. To do so it is necessary to sustainably manage agri-food supply chains beginning with the crop planning decisions. Although the centralized approach has usually been adopted for this purpose, it can lead to unfair solutions due to inequitable distribution of profits among farmers causing their unwillingness to collaborate in the implementation of decisions made. To solve this, in this paper a novel centralized multi-objective mathematical programming model is proposed to support the sustainable crop planning definition for a region that jointly optimize three objectives aligned to the sustainability aspects: supply chain profits maximization (economic objective), waste minimization (environmental objective) and unfairness among farmers minimization (social objective), being the last two objectives novel in the crop planning literature. It has also shown the conflicting nature of the three objectives finding trade-offs among them. Other novelties of this proposal are: (1) anticipation of operative decisions (such as harvest, transport, sale, clearance sale, waste and unmet demand) when defining the crop planning, (2) possibility of clearing the oversupply of crops as a means of increasing the farmers’ profits and reducing waste, and (3) the modelling of a agri-food supply chain characterized by the lack of intermediaries between farmers and retailers, fostering the freshest product delivery and farmers’ power position. The model is solved by applying the weighted sum method concluding that the crop waste generated along the chain and the unfairness among farmers can be considerably reduced by little decreasing the optimal SC profits.","Esteso A., Alemany M.M.E., Ortiz A., Liu S.",Optimization model to support sustainable crop planning for reducing unfairness among farmers,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106430968&doi=10.1007%2fs10100-021-00751-8&partnerID=40&md5=ae5c6db455cd3098a61e97b4b161f42b

What is more, AFNs are often characterized by their ‘sustainability promise’ – or the idea that their networks foster social, ecological or environmental improvements over conventional food networks. Based on a purposive sample of 286 producers across five Swedish AFNs (i.e. community supported agriculture, REKO-rings, farmers’ markets, farm stores and food nodes), we explore how differences in how supply chain activities are managed and relate them to profitability, fair wages, cooperation, logistics efforts, happiness and future beliefs. Using a combination of correlation analysis, linear regression and means comparisons, we challenge the notion that AFNs achieve their sustainability promise or enhance value through novel combinations of supply chain activities. Our findings include several key differences in how supply chain management (SCM) activities are organized across AFNs and their variant importance for profitability. Moreover, we find significant differences in happiness across AFNs that are better explained through beliefs about the future than profitability or fair wages. By exploring happiness and profitability, we offer insights into why some AFN actors thrive despite poor economic returns.","Hunter E., Norrman A., Bergc E.",Quantifying differences in alternative food network supply chain activities and their relationship with socio-economic outcomes,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121451553&doi=10.22434%2fIFAMR2020.0193&partnerID=40&md5=d76e86a838eb62ef44399cdf9f064daa
One Earth,"Although natural gas generates lower CO2 emissions, gas extraction, processing, and distribution all release methane, which has a greater global warming potential than CO2. Biomethane and biogas that use organic wastes as a feedstock have emerged as alternatives to natural gas, with lower carbon and methane emissions. However, the extent to which methane is still emitted at various stages along biogas and biomethane supply chains remains unclear. Here, we adopt a Monte Carlo approach to systematically synthesize the distribution of methane emissions at each key biomethane and biogas supply chain stage using data collected from the existing literature. We show that the top 5% of emitters are responsible for 62% of emissions. Methane emissions could be more than two times of greater than previously estimated, with the digestate handling stage responsible for the majority of methane released. To ensure the climate benefits of biomethane and biogas production, effective methane-mitigation strategies must be designed and deployed at each supply chain stage.","Bakkaloglu S., Cooper J., Hawkes A.",Methane emissions along biomethane and biogas supply chains are underestimated,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133263070&doi=10.1016%2fj.oneear.2022.05.012&partnerID=40&md5=89308366f394251dd9a1258d485fbb89
"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Although the circular economy is a key strategy to mitigate climate change, the relationship between them has rarely been investigated. This study aims to fill this gap by applying a life cycle assessment to evaluate the benefits of circularity interventions in the tanning industry. We compared the baseline scenario with no circular actions a circular scenario with salt recovery and tannin baths reuse. We then calculated the environmental benefits with regard to vegetable-tanned leather. Although our results proved the positive effects of the circularity activities adopted in the production phase, the environmental impacts related to the upstream supply chain of the leather accounted for 85% of the total negative impact. In fact, the environmental benefits obtained were completely nullified by the impact of cattle raising and slaughtering, which even led to a slight deterioration in the circular scenario. Our study highlighted the need to better align interventions designed to promote circularity and mitigate climate change by expanding the range of actions to the company's suppliers. We revealed that a green supply chain management is key to achieving circularity and a zero-carbon future. Lastly, we also highlighted the importance of adopting life cycle assessments to evaluate the effects of circular business models, but especially to identify the main environmental hotspots. By using an LCA, organisations will be able to avoid circular washing, i.e., circular practices that provide only limited benefits in relation to the overall environmental footprint.","Marrucci L., Corcelli F., Daddi T., Iraldo F.",Using a life cycle assessment to identify the risk of “circular washing” in the leather industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132853509&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2022.106466&partnerID=40&md5=2af602ef32f5dbdbad22ffb6aacacc90
Foods,"Although the different alternative food networks (AFNs) have experienced increases worldwide for the last thirty years, they are still unable to provide an alternative capable of spreading on a large scale. They in fact remain niche experiments due to some limitations on their structure and governance. Thus, this study proposes and applies a design method to build a new sustainable food supply chain model capable of realizing a “jumping scale”. Based on the theoretical and value framework of the Civil Economy (CE), the Economy for the Common Good (ECG), and the Development on a Human Scale (H-SD), the proposed design model aims to satisfy the needs of all stakeholders in the supply chain. Max-Neef’s Needs Matrix and Design Thinking (DT) tools were used to develop the design model. Applying the design method to the food chain has allowed us to develop the concept of the “Food Village”, an innovative food supply network far from the current economic mechanisms and based on the community and eco-sustainability.","Stella G., Torquati B., Paffarini C., Giordani G., Cecchini L., Poletti R.",“Food Village”: An Innovative Alternative Food Network Based on Human Scale Development Economic Model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130754036&doi=10.3390%2ffoods11101447&partnerID=40&md5=826f0376b5bebfc3a9f01799f3614dec
Forest Policy and Economics,"Although the importance of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is increasingly recognised across the globe, their potential is not yet fully realised. Their often valuable nutritional composition and discovery of new possible applications offer further opportunities for innovation and rural development. Yet only few NTFPs manage the jump from traditional, informal use to global markets. Therefore, this paper assesses how baobab (Adansonia digitata L) fruit products overcame the challenges faced by most NTFPs in gaining access to such markets, discussing factors contributing to its emergence and how sustainability aspects were addressed. Complex interactions of a variety of actors and institutions in the global South and the global North, encompassing both the production as well as the consumption side, were necessary for these developments. Triggered by the rising demand for natural, healthy foods and growing knowledge and appreciation for indigenous products, increasing numbers of entrepreneurs and development organisations entered the scene. Poor climates for innovation and enterprise development in the producer countries were overcome by developing the sector bottom-up using external support inducing a variety of innovations including supply chain modifications in order to comply with the high quality standards demanded. With baobab previously unknown to Western consumers new markets were formed due to the combined efforts by a variety of both private and public stakeholders and demand for baobab fruit powder rose to several hundred tons per year after the acceptance as novel food in European and US markets. Numerous products are now available predominantly in niche, early adopter markets focusing on healthy or organic foods. However, further support of the sector is necessary to ensure sustainable commercialisation of baobab resources. With the developmental impact being higher the more ethically, sustainably sourced baobab is sold, activities focusing on increasing demand and raising awareness on the consumer side may well have a higher impact than direct efforts aimed towards the production systems.","Meinhold K., Dumenu W.K., Darr D.",Connecting rural non-timber forest product collectors to global markets: The case of baobab (Adansonia digitata L.),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118897916&doi=10.1016%2fj.forpol.2021.102628&partnerID=40&md5=0c4ebe863db61daa8bafe2eb5fb259ab
Journal of Civil Engineering and Management,"Although the importance of supply chain management in the construction sector has been recognized in recent years, its implementation still faces significant challenges. For the long-term evaluation of this creative sector, numerous intricate sustainability components, such as environmental, social, and financial, are necessary. The study focuses on long-term sustainability considerations in the supply chain in the construction sector. This work aims to address this information and examine sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) research in the construction sector in this manner. More than 95 publications were studied from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2021 using both in-depth content analysis and bibliometric methodologies. Several issues of SSCM in construction have been found including environmental, economic and social patterns which are most commonly known as the triple bottom line, typically enhanced by artificial intelligence. Many challenges were discovered including inefficiencies in the logistics system and a shortage of funding, environmental issues in demolition procedures and difficulties in applying sustainability measures due to high skill, data, and time requirements. The article offers a broad list of potentials for improving the current situation in the construction sector by using various types of supply chains such as increasing investment in energy conservation and emission reduction technologies to drive sustainable development, establishing strong green supply chain relationships, and forming a Covid-19 financial support group for small construction companies among other things. The study’s findings suggested that due to the significance of long-term relationships between construction companies, suppliers and customers, smart technology could make it simpler to reach every supply chain link. After an exhaustive literature review 59 research questions were formulated for the future research. In the future, the importance of these questions could be determined using expert questionnaires and multi-criteria evaluation.","Cataldo I., Banaitis A., Samadhiya A., Banaitienė N., Kumar A., Luthra S.",SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION: AN EXPLORATORY REVIEW FOR FUTURE RESEARCH,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136333707&doi=10.3846%2fjcem.2022.17202&partnerID=40&md5=5de6dc566de471985f4d0ad93f049977
Journal of Business Economics,"Ameliorating and deteriorating products, or, more generally, items that change value over time, present a high sensitiveness to the surrounding environment (e.g., temperature, humidity, and light intensity). For this reason, they should be properly stored along the supply chain to guarantee the desired quality to the consumers. Specifically, ameliorating items face an increase in value if there are stored for longer periods, which can lead to higher selling price. At the same time, the costumers’ demand is sensitive to the price (i.e., the higher the selling price the lower the final demand), sensitiveness that is related to the quality of the products (i.e., lower sensitiveness for high-quality products). On the contrary, deteriorating items lose quality and value over time which result in revenue losses due to lost sales or reduced selling price. Since these products need to be properly stored (i.e., usually in temperature- and humidity-controlled warehouses) the holding costs, which comprise also the energy costs, may be particularly relevant impacting on the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of the supply chain. Furthermore, due to the recent economic crisis, companies (especially, small and medium enterprises) face payment difficulties of customers and high volatility of resources prices. This increases the risk of insolvency and on the other hand the financing needs. In this context, supply chain finance emerged as a mean for efficiency by coordinating the financial flow and providing a set of financial schemes aiming at optimizing accounts payable and receivable along the supply chain. The aim of the present study is thus to investigate through a systematic literature review the two main themes presented (i.e., inventory management models for products that change value over time, and financial techniques and strategies to support companies in inventory management) to understand if any financial technique has been studied for supporting the management of this class of products and to verify the existing literature gap.","Marchi B., Zavanella L.E., Zanoni S.",Supply chain finance for ameliorating and deteriorating products: a systematic literature review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134659323&doi=10.1007%2fs11573-022-01108-6&partnerID=40&md5=2f167927f9060ad256a1177b9df5dab8

"IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON","amidst the economic, social, and environmental disruption being faced due to the COVID-19 outbreak, SMEs are being challenged with how best to ensure business continuity. As a result, business continuity and global supply chain performance are disrupted. Due to the damage caused by the outbreak of the Coronavirus, if the economic, social, and environmental losses are not addressed quickly, and practical policies and strategies are not adopted, the damage will be exponential. This means that many SMEs will face many crises in the future. Good governance has significant potential for sustainability & continuity of operations of the business, modernizing SMEs, business model innovation, new business development, improving public service delivery, addressing complex development needs and promoting prosperity, and may help achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations. In this regard, smart governance to support business strategies remains an important driving force for this transition, especially in the face of international market pressures and global competition. And it offers incredible opportunities to innovate, strengthen and improve efficient practices and bring many benefits. In the meantime, the role of education is vital for sustainability. Education for sustainability leads to the accumulation of human capital in organizations by improving individual skills, abilities, and competencies. Companies that have better sustainability training have enjoyed more sustainable growth and development by using high-tech and knowledge-based products. In today's increasingly complex social environments, many E-governance is working to ensure effective planning, implementation, and delivery of education policies. training in sustainable SMEs helps enthusiasts gain the necessary competence and skills to initiate sustainable enterprises. In fact, companies are no longer just legal in nature, and their main goal is not just profitability and accountability to shareholders. Companies have become citizens who are responsible for society and must become good corporate citizens. Innovative SMEs and their business ecosystems can be a major strength in achieving the goals of green technologies, the circular economy, as well as an innovation-enabling policy- and regulatory framework.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"Amidst the number of studies on sustainable purchasing and supply management (PSM), we have yet to learn how sustainability becomes a logic for organisations and their stakeholders. Thus, this paper offers an extended approach on the emergence of an institutional logic of sustainability (ILS). Our contribution includes the macro mechanisms supporting the robust and continuous adoption of an ILS for procurement. Three distinct trajectories of an ILS emerged from the literature, and their application to sustainable PSM is illustrated using real-world examples. The trajectories rely upon the evolution of (1) institutional entrepreneurs or (2) PSM structures but also can happen through (3) the co-evolution of both. By offering a conceptual model and a set of research propositions for future theory and empirical testing, this paper helps scholars and practitioners to advance their knowledge on managing purchasing departments according to sustainability values and making it a competitiveness factor.

Chemical Engineering Transactions,"Ammonia is a fundamental commodity that boosts a well-established supply chain optimized for over a century. Produced primarily by the Haber-Bosch process, ammonia production has become more efficient over time through many technological advancements. However, it entails a significant carbon footprint due to its use of hydrogen obtained from fossil fuels. The need to address these sustainability challenges raised by the demand for fossil fuel and subsequent greenhouse gas emissions paved the way for several renewable production routes. As more sustainable means of production were developed, the range of ammonia’s applicability also expanded. While ammonia continues to be a vital fertilizer and raw material for various commodity chemicals globally, its potential as a critical energy carrier presently takes center stage. Primarily seen as a hydrogen carrier, ammonia’s decomposition into hydrogen and nitrogen was deemed necessary and led to the recent advancements for its direct application as a fuel. Thus, ammonia has several sustainable synthesis and utilization routes that must be carefully analyzed to explore synergies that further promote circularity. This work enables the design of profitable ammonia synthesis and utilization networks from a set of extensive processes with emission constraints through a robust multi-resource integration model. The optimization determined carbon-negative solutions under specified distribution scenarios that integrated green ammonia synthesis with carbon capture and utilization, renewable energy, and negative emissions technologies, achieving net removals of 652,000 and 350,936 t of carbon dioxide annually, while respectively generating profits of 573 and 263 M$/y.","Abraham E.J., Al-Mohannadi D.M.",Design and Analysis of Ammonia Synthesis and Utilization Networks,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139507061&doi=10.3303%2fCET2294223&partnerID=40&md5=9ea60aba9091bdc40840872bc989a332
Procedia CIRP,"An increasing awareness of sustainability and scarcity of resources requires to enhance a product's lifetime. Within the context of a circular economy, remanufacturing therefore can be applied. Used products (so-called 'cores') are returned to at least their original performance. An efficient planning and management of reverse supply chains (RSC) is a prerequisite for successful remanufacturing. Besides the required material flow from the customer via service centers, collection stations, and core brokers to the remanufacturing plants, the reverse flow of core information is essential. The multi-tier exchange of core information potentially facilitates reducing existent uncertainties in RSC, i.e. regarding timing, quantity, and quality of returned products. Yet, current approaches neither consider the multi-tier information flow nor the differentiation of core information for different downstream tasks in detail. Specifically, information flow in the automotive RSC remains to be researched in detail. Therefore, the potential of an increased exchange of core information for remanufacturing in RSC is explored in this paper. A literature review and expert interviews with the stakeholders in the automotive RSC are conducted to assess the status quo of information exchange. Based on this, relevant core-specific information, and their impact on increasing the efficiency of different downstream planning processes are identified. To quantify the potential of an increased information exchange, both a model for the categorical use of information and a receptor model are developed. It can be concluded that an increase in the exchange of information in remanufacturing goes along with a multitude of facilitations, e.g. regarding logistics optimization, material requirement planning and stochastic routing of cores. Moreover, due to the prioritization of core information, a sequence model for core information retrieval can be derived.","Klenk F., Gallei M., Wurster M., Wagner M., Peukert S., Lanza G.",Potential assessment of an increased exchange of core information for remanufacturing in automotive reverse supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127492004&doi=10.1016%2fj.procir.2022.02.074&partnerID=40&md5=015d9947b73a036bc6220de59ac77e7d

South African Journal of Chemical Engineering,"An oil palm value chain (OPVC) considers the interconnectivity between each activity within the oil palm industry to allow for a top-down overview of the industry, while capturing the details for more substantial system interactions. However, it is a challenge to deliver the big picture without a proper tool, especially for an extensive value chain network with various processes, the existence of multiple facilities for each process, and supply chain management system. In this respect, a novel systematic approach is developed to synthesise and optimise an integrated OPVC network for higher economic and environmental performance. In this work, an OPVC case study in Johor state is presented and solved to illustrate the proposed approach. Besides, the coalition reliability index is introduced to measure the reliability of the OPVC network formed under different supply chain management. The results demonstrated that the value-added across the entire value chain improves significantly, from 167.0 million US$/y in the conventional design to 220.2 million US$/y. Meanwhile, greenhouse gas emission is reduced substantially from 2700 to 1878 kt CO2e/y.

"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Antimony is considered a critical and strategically important metal and is used in a wide range of products. This study examines major antimony supply chain disruptions from 1913 to 2018 and analyses how resilience mechanisms and price feedback loops contributed to supply chain resilience. We found that the antimony diversity of supply of both mining and refining is low, but is enhanced by recycling, around 25% of global antimony supply is produced via recycling of antimony bearing metal alloys. Based on production volume, almost 70% of antimony was mined as by- or co-product in 2018, indicating a high supply risk. However, the presence of unrecovered by-products can also make the supply more elastic. Substitution is possible for some antimony applications, but for one of the main applications, flame retardants, performance of substitutes is still considered inadequate. Overall, stockpiling played a significant role in both dampening and exacerbating supply disruptions. It is recommended that the mined production and processing capabilities are diversified, stockpiles are explored as a mechanism to absorb sudden shortages, and, most importantly, recycling of antimony (trioxide) should be further improved.","Brink S.V.D., Kleijn R., Sprecher B., Mancheri N., Tukker A.",Resilience in the antimony supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135713881&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2022.106586&partnerID=40&md5=40a4ae7e72f8bf0c457e347d02b9b2e8
Textile Research Journal,"Apart from the many social and health problems it has caused, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on most sectors of the economy worldwide. One of the areas where such impact is noticeable is the textile, apparel, and fashion (TAF) industry. The lockdowns and limited access to retailer outlets resulted in a considerable drop in consumption, creating problems related to the excess of stock, the decrease of sales, and the disposal of non-used items. This paper outlines the implications of the COVID-19 on the TAF sectors and European retailers. It analyzes how the current supply chains exacerbated stock control problems, and it reports on the changes in consumption during the pandemic. The worldwide restrictive measures implemented to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic were responsible for significant profit losses. Also, the decrease in consumption, caused by several geographically wide lockdowns, prompted a subsequent reduction in orders and sales, resulting in a significant number of constraints. The implementation of more environmentally friendly processes, including sustainable circularity as a competitiveness source to keep the TAF sectors in the loop and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, may help address the problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the sustainability context, as reported in this paper.","Leal Filho W., Dinis M.A.P., do Paço A., Herédia-Colaço V., Veiga Avila L., Dennis K., Tyler D., Neiva S., Liakh O.","COVID-19 and sustainability in textile, apparel and fashion use: an assessment of trends",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139005687&doi=10.1177%2f00405175221114167&partnerID=40&md5=73ccc37aa48da3cd8bab0a74758e9c47
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Apparel and textile sector is one of the most polluting sectors. It is majorly responsible for air, water, soil pollution and other negative effect. To counter this, implementing the sustainability practices play the major role. This study identified the various barriers that hinders, implementation of sustainability across the different stages of supply chain management. Moreover, opinion from the experts is taken for distinguishing the critical barriers. ISM and fuzzy MICMAC decision making techniques are used for the identification of critical barriers. It was found out that Communication gap among stakeholders, Barriers that effect performance of this sector, Lack of training and education about sustainability, Capacity constraints and Lack of reverse logistics practices are the critical barriers of sustainable supply chain management. In addition to this DEMATEL is used to classified the barriers into two groups i,e cause based and effect based.

Journal of Environmental Management,"Apple is one of the most important cash crops in China. However, negative economic, environmental and social impacts are associated with its production. This study aims to apply a holistic systems perspective to understand existing problems associated with apple production in China and use this information to improve its sustainability. A structured survey was administered to farmers (n = 245) in Shandong and Shanxi provinces, combined with semi-structured interviews with apple supply chain stakeholders (n = 25). Themes, dimensions and relationships were identified based on an inductive thematic analysis of interview data, and then triangulated against the survey data. Interpretive Structural Modelling and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification methods were applied to investigate interrelationships and effects of the elicited elements within the system. The results indicated that various environmental, economic and social problems are associated with apple production in China, including environmental and health risks associated with synthetic input applications, yield instability, deterioration of apple quality, farmers’ uncertainty about accessing routes to market, and the ageing farming workforce. The interaction of socio-economic and supply chain issues has contributed to the system “lock-in” to unsustainable practices within the apple production system. Existing agricultural policies were ineffective as they did not include policy leverage to mitigate the multiple factors driving lock-in to unsustainable practices within the system. The research has provided evidence to enable policymakers to develop effective and targeted strategies to facilitate sustainable production within the apple production system. In particular, the future policy mix should consider the entirety of the food system including perspectives and requirements of different stakeholders. The three-stage approach applied has demonstrated its feasibility of investigating sustainability issues facing a particular industry within a specific cultural and policy context.","Jin S., Li W., Cao Y., Jones G., Chen J., Li Z., Chang Q., Yang G., Frewer L.J.",Identifying barriers to sustainable apple production: A stakeholder perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118892243&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2021.114082&partnerID=40&md5=a5a6da891b0ed16e93a50999a0ae1c28
Green Chemistry,"Applying green chemistry principles in raw material selection for down-the-drain products is a powerful tool to improve product sustainability. We developed a method to support sustainability-minded design, or eco-innovation, implemented as a spreadsheet tool, for assessing the potential environmental impact of down-the-drain personal care products at the early design stage. End-of-life ecological risk assessment (ERA) is traditionally used for down-the-drain products. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) include a broader range of impacts but require supply chain data not available at the early design stage. We used all feasible ERA and LCA measurement scales for environmental concerns as “potential impact indicators” (PI-indicators). PI-indicators from ERA include bioconcentration in fish and Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs) in water, sediment, and/or soil, depending on the environmental fate of ingredients in the product. PI-indicators from LCA include phosphorus content (eutrophication potential), photochemical ozone (smog) formation potential, mineral resource depletion, and direct emissions of greenhouse gases or ozone depleters. Emerging regulatory concerns included are persistence, subsurface migration potential, and partial degradation of polymers. PI-indicators are aggregated using weighting factors to yield a rank between 1 (best) and 10 (worst) for each ingredient and translated to a product rank using a weighted average. The tool allows end users to change PI-indicators as science and priorities change. The method is demonstrated for 10 shampoo and 9 facial makeup products illustrating differentiation among formulas to promote sustainability at the early product design stage.","Saxe J.K., Hoffman L., Labib R.",Method to incorporate green chemistry principles in early-stage product design for sustainability: case studies with personal care products,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131969326&doi=10.1039%2fd2gc00842d&partnerID=40&md5=e7e1330d2e9ab85e7371ce0eddbcd004
Operations Management Research,"Appraising sustainable supply chain performance is of great importance in today’s world. Businesses, for attaining competitive advantages, call for some methods to appraise their sustainable supply chains. Applying valid performance evaluation methods along with using accurate accounting data leads to valid and reliable results. A performance appraisal method using sustainability accounting information, which is provided based on environmental, social, and economic sides of sustainability, supports managers perfectly in achieving their long-lasting aims. On the other hand, data derived from accounting systems are both positive and non-positive. Therefore, a performance evaluation model should be able to work with negative and zero data. In this research, to present a powerful mathematical technique for appraising network structure of supply chains, a network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) model is developed. Since traditional NDEA models do not work with non-positive data and fail to rank DMUs with the same efficiency scores, the main purpose of this paper is to develop a new super-efficiency NDEA (SNDEA) model for evaluating sustainable supply chains in the presence of both positive and non-positive data. To get more reliable results, a new formula of ""output surplus index” is introduced to calculate the super-efficiency scores when some data are non-positive.

Review of International Political Economy,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to greatly enhance the productivity and efficiency of global supply chains over the next decade. Transnational corporations are hailing these gains as a ‘game changer’ for advancing environmental sustainability. Yet, looking through a political economy lens, it is clear that AI is not advancing sustainability nearly as much as industry leaders are claiming. As this article argues, the metrics and rhetoric of corporate social responsibility are exaggerating the benefits and obscuring the costs of AI. Productivity and efficiency gains in the middle sections of supply chains are rebounding into more production and consumption, doing far more to enhance the profitability of big business than the sustainability of the earth. At the same time, AI is accelerating natural resource extraction and the distancing of waste, casting dark shadows of harm across marginalized communities, fragile ecosystems, and future generations. The micro-level gains from AI, as this article exposes, are not going to add up to macro-level solutions for the negative environmental consequences of global supply chains, while portraying AI as a force of sustainability is legitimizing business as usual, reinforcing a narrative of corporate responsibility, obfuscating the need for greater state regulation, and empowering transnational corporations as global governors.

Journal of Operations Management,"Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) make up roughly 90% of the colored gemstone trade, a still untamed industry where money laundering, cartels, arms purchases, and crime run rampant while many miners prospect and dream of finding “the big one.” Women make up to 30% to 50% of ASM, often in developing regions. Struggling to make a living and support their families, women miners are subject to discrimination, unfair labor practices, and poor access to rich foreign markets. Grounded in a longitudinal case study in Africa, this qualitative research examines the journey of an organization seeking to emancipate women miners through supply chains that embrace technology, provenance, and disintermediation. This research demonstrates the strategic value of emancipatory technologies for firms. Secondly, we find evidence that combinations of storytelling and digital records create multidimensional provenance that mitigates a number of supply chain risks, particularly in tainted chains.

Resources Policy,"Artisanal miners' access to economically and geologically viable lands in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)'s Copperbelt region is a core limitation to responsible cobalt sourcing programs. First established to respond to sourcing risks such as child labor and poor working conditions, responsible cobalt sourcing programs need to increase their scope to root causes. In this article I argue that with the increased attention on responsible sourcing of cobalt, actors across the supply chains should address land access rights issues to effectively tackle reputational risks. These risks affect the image of brand companies which then trickle the responsibility of addressing them down their supply chains. Commodified lands, distributed to private actors through concession-making, led to a highly competitive relationship between artisanal and industrial miners. The absence of available land now prevents the establishment of sustainable responsible sourcing programs. Building on Hilson, Sauerwein and Owen's concept of autonomous coexistence and recognizing the importance of context-sensitivity, I introduce the possibility to define autonomous cohabitation as an avenue for ensuring that artisanal miners securely access economically and geologically viable areas on industrial concessions in the DRC. I argue that companies involved in responsible sourcing programs should aim to develop autonomous cohabitation between ASM and LSM, in which long-term agreements, secured by the DRC state and its newly establish monopoly, the Entreprise Générale du Cobalt (EGC), ensure that land could be shared under specific legal terms, while the production would be sold to the monopoly established by EGC. Taking the example of two responsible sourcing programs, the Mutoshi Pilot Project (now inactive) and Better Mining, I argue that the current interest in visible risks hinders the capacity of these programs to successfully tackle root causes, including land access rights.",Deberdt R.,Land access rights in minerals’ responsible sourcing.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"As a concern with manufacturing industries, circular economy (CE) practices—often labeled “circular manufacturing (CM)”—are industrial tasks through which several circular economy principles have been integrated. Among these circular manufacturing strategies, “3R” (recycle, refurbish/remanufacture, and reuse/redistribute) is the key strategy that assists the manufacturing industry with closing the loop for sustainability. An effective inclusion and management of 3R lead a firm to a greater likelihood of successfully integrating CE and CM. In recent years, remanufacturing has gained greater prominence, especially with the emergence of technology, including cyber-physical systems. These technologies assist the remanufacturing firm with efficient take-back systems through tracking. However, data transferred through these technologies among value chain partners in remanufacturing are not reliable. Due to the lack of trust and transparency, value chain partners are hesitant to participate in remanufacturing supply chains. To address the limitation of technologies in remanufacturing, blockchain has been introduced to secure the data. Despite the advantages of blockchain technology, practitioners face difficulties in integrating these blockchain technologies into the remanufacturing context. Several earlier studies addressed the challenges of implementing blockchain, but no earlier studies have specifically examined remanufacturing industries, which are entirely different from forward supply chain industries. Concerning the fact, this study identifies the barriers that exist with the implementation of blockchain technology in the application of the remanufacturing sector. A framework has been proposed and validated in a Danish automotive parts remanufacturing company. Multi-criteria decision-making method has been used to identify the effective and most influential barriers among common barriers. Results reveal that “scaling of technology” (B6) is the key barrier of BCT implementation in remanufacturing context. This study concludes with useful discussions based on the results along with the recommendations to eradicate those influential barriers and their respective impacts on SDGs (SDG4, SDG8, SDG9, and SDG17).

Processes,"As a consequence of increased awareness of environmental preservation and the associated rigorous regulations, the adoption of sustainable practices has become a crucial element for corporate organizations in regard to their supply chains. In the chemical industry, which is characterized by high risks, high pollution, and high efficiency, these characteristics can help businesses analyze their long-term development and sustainability. The goal of this research is to analyze and choose possible suppliers based on their sustainability performance in the chemical sector. A methodology based on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is proposed for this evaluation, using spherical fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (SF-AHP) and combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) methods, in which the novel spherical fuzzy sets theory is employed to present the ambiguous linguistic preferences of experts. In the first stage, an evaluation criteria system is identified through literature review and experts’ opinions. The SF-AHP is used to determine the criteria weights, while the CoCoSo method is utilized to select the right sustainable supplier. A case study in the chemical industry in Vietnam is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. From the SF-AHP findings, ""equipment system and technology capability"", ""flexibility and reliability"", ""logistics cost"", ""green materials and technologies"", and ""on-time delivery"" were ranked as the five most important criteria. From the CoCoSo analysis, Vietnam National Chemical Group (CHE-05) was found to be the best supplier. A sensitivity study and a comparison analysis of methods were also conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed model, and the priority rankings of the best suppliers were very similar. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has proposed SF-AHP and CoCoSo to prioritize SSS evaluation criteria and determine the best alternatives. The suggested method and findings can be used to make well-informed decisions that help businesses to achieve supply chain sustainability, capture opportunities, and maintain competitiveness through reconfiguring resources. The method could be useful for case studies in other countries and for other sustainability problems.","Wang C.-N., Chou C.-C., Dang T.-T., Nguyen H.-P., Nguyen N.-A.-T.",Integrating Triple Bottom Line in Sustainable Chemical Supplier Selection: A Compromise Decision-Making-Based Spherical Fuzzy Approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130521619&doi=10.3390%2fpr10050889&partnerID=40&md5=7c7b752ed4db56f36326801a10686d28

This study's categorization of technological and behavioral GSCM practices and results add to the literature on GSCM. The empirical findings indicate that the technological GSCM practices considerably affect behavioral practices. Moreover, GSCM technological and behavioral practices have a substantial effect on institutional performance. GSCM behavioral practices mediate the link between technological GSCM practices and institutional performance. The outcomes also reveal that organizational pressure moderates the association between GSCM technological GSCM practices and institutional performance.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chains (SCs) have been exposed to their greatest disruption in recent memory. This unprecedented situation has given rise to the concept of SC survivability, which is based on the need to find a new temporary equilibrium allowing SCs to survive during extreme events. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the conceptualization of SC survivability by providing some basic foundations for this new concept. Our analysis shows that dealing with SC survivability requires a larger scale than those adopted for the analysis of SC resilience. To solve this issue, we propose a new framework called “Human Needs Supply chains”. This framework shows the interdependencies between SCs, society, and the environment and enables a shift from the classical SC's product-profit view to a holistic view centred on the satisfaction of basic human needs. Another contribution of this research is to highlight the links between SC survivability, SC resilience, and SC sustainability. We show that the classical resilience capacities (i.e., absorptive, adaptive, and restorative) are not enough to deal with extraordinary and long-term disruptions such as COVID-19, and we propose an adaptation of the SC resilience concept to integrate a survivability capacity.

International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations,"As a useful strategy to improve the flexibility of the system to manage uncertainty in supply and demand and to improve the sustainability of the supply chain, vendor-managed inventory (VMI) programs have attracted widespread attention in the field of supply chain management. However, a growing body of empirical literature has shown that participants’ decisions deviate significantly from the standard theoretical predictions. Under a VMI program, the supplier bears not only the production cost, but also the risk of leftover inventory. Moreover, the inequality among participants and different personalities of decision-makers in VMI programs may lead to the divergence of decision-making. To understand the supplier’s replenishment decision in view of the behavioral pattern, we propose a new inventory model for the supplier with the focus theory of choice. The proposed model conceives that the retailer evaluates each replenishment quantity based on the most salient demand for him/her instead of calculating the expected utility. By employing this inventory model, we construct a two-tier supply chain model with revenue-sharing contract and theoretically derive the optimal sharing percentage of the revenue and replenishment quantity. Results analysis gains managerial insights into the strategic selection of the retailer who faces suppliers with different personalities. Comparisons between the classic revenue-sharing contract model and the proposed model are also carried out by illustrative examples.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"As agriculture and industry exploit more than 90% of the global freshwater resources, water overuse and degradation have emerged as critical socio-environmental challenges for both nations and corporations. In this context, the water footprint concept was introduced in order to quantify the freshwater consumption and pollution of a territory or across a product’s life cycle. As research on water management in supply chains is growing, this work aims to integrate the perspective of freshwater resources into supply network configuration. Focusing on the agrifood sector, we have developed a mixed-integer linear programming model that can be used to minimize the operational costs under a water footprint cap in a wine supply chain network by selecting the optimal suppliers (vine growers), manufacturing sites (winemakers), and transportation modes (fuel-powered trucks). The optimization outcomes unveil that the wine network’s configurations (structure and fuel type) vary significantly depending on the values of the water footprint cap so as to balance the trade-off between economic and water-related environmental efficiency.

Unbalance of the Iron-triangle which refers to key Construction Project Goals (CPG) (i.e., time, cost, and quality) is one of the phenomena that can be addressed while Sustainable Development (SD) (i.e., economic, social, and environmental sustainability) has been streamlined to worse condition. Even though, sustainability must be prioritised in developing countries e.g., Sri Lanka, where significant construction works are currently underway, especially during this situation. Further, the appropriate construction and implementation in a construction project can make a dramatic contribution to the mandate of sustainable development. Hence, this research intends to investigate how the Iron triangle would be unbalanced during the new-normal situation where it has a significant impact on SD simultaneously. A qualitative survey strategy was used to achieve the research aim. A semi-structured interview survey was conducted to solicit the perception of experts. Nine experts were selected purposively, who had experience in both Sustainable Construction (SC) and project management, especially proceedings during the new-normal condition. To analyse the empirical data, the manual content analysis method was used. As the decisive outcome, the ‘Iron-star’ model was developed by merging the Sustainable triangle and Iron-triangle which pertained to the interrelation between SD and Construction Project Goals (CPG). Initially, interrelations between SD measures and CPG were cogitated by literature findings. Economic depletion, health-related issues, supply chain disruption, and cash flow issues were identified as interventions to achieve CPG through SD measures. Further, it revealed that the Iron-star can implement as the way forward for the construction industry in the Sri Lankan (SL) context.","Rathnakumara L.R.V.N., Chandanie H.",BEYOND THE IRON-TRIANGLE: ACCOMMODATING SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION IN THE NEW-NORMAL CONDITIONS,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137338385&doi=10.31705%2fWCS.2022.14&partnerID=40&md5=986ed2e01e8f0411cf3f8e0978e4f05c
Sustainability (Switzerland),"As part of the European Green Deal, the European Commission recently launched the project “New European Bauhaus of the 21st Century” to promote climate-neutral, affordable, and creative design approaches and transform the built environment towards sustainability. Based on a forecasting and backcasting approach, we developed three sets of measures containing eighteen individual measures, with the overall aim of reducing the consumption of mineral raw materials in line with the sustainability strategies (consistency, efficiency, and sufficiency) from exploration through material processing, to semi-finished product production. The developed measures address in detail the reduction of primary raw material consumption, the increased use of secondary raw materials, and the intensification of access to important domestic raw material sources, as well as the efficiency and productivity progression of the Austrian raw material industry. The implementation of the measures will raise the transparency and traceability of raw material routes, material flows, and supply chains through improved and comprehensive data collection and processing. The developed measures were handed over to the Austrian Federal Government in February 2022 to push the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 in Austria.","Trummer P., Ammerer G., Scherz M.",Sustainable Consumption and Production in the Extraction and Processing of Raw Materials—Measures Sets for Achieving SDG Target 12.2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137855508&doi=10.3390%2fsu141710971&partnerID=40&md5=81f9251afdc89cbaf24988ef4a7e9010
Business Strategy and the Environment,"As sustainability draws increasing attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in the green supply chain has likewise substantially increased. The present study contributes deeper insights into the logical integration of the resource-based characteristics that can facilitate the effective transition from traditional to green supply chains while also increasing the effectiveness of existing green supply chains. The proposed model, rooted in the resource-based view (RBV) theory, examines the associations of supply chain connectivity (SCC), supply chain information sharing (SCIS), top management commitment (TMC) and green procurement and logistics acceptance (GPLA) with green supply chain management (GSCM). Analysis of data from employees at 381 manufacturing firms in the United Kingdom confirmed the positive associations of SCC and SCIS with TMC and GPLA, of TMC with GPLA and GSCM and of GPLA with GSCM. The results also confirmed the serial mediation effect of TMC and GPLA on the associations of both SCC and SCIS with GSCM.

A branch delimitation algorithm MCTS_BB using Monte Carlo tree search improvement was designed for efficient solution. The five indicators were normalized by their interrelated influence and affiliation and a multi-objective decision matrix was constructed. Then, a mixed-integer linear planning model was constructed by linearly combining the multi-objective functions using the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues in the decision matrix. The model was solved with branch selection, stochastic simulation search and pruning strategies in MCTS_BB.

"2022 IEEE 6th International Conference on Logistics Operations Management, GOL 2022","As the competences of the people involved-in play a pivotal role in supply chain and logistics, this paper highlights that rather than offering top-down answers to challenges supply chain and logistics sector face, a better idea is to prompt a sharing of experiences, of ideas and of methodological tools which allows the development of sustainable relationships between training providers and the supply chain, as a complex set of entities and systems, the air transport being one of those. Considering this is a moment in education for sustainability research and practice when both researchers and practitioners are thirsty for new models of qualifications' description that could be more practical, far-reaching, and reflective in helping them move beyond the traditional approach, this paper presents the theoretical and methodological components of a qualification framework and a case-study on using it when designing a study program for one of the new qualifications which require digital and soft skills as creativity, autonomy, self-management, team research and work, interdisciplinary competences. As a free and open tool, it is accessible to every member in higher educational community and can be adapted to the needs of any tertiary education study program.

Ambio,"As the world grows more interconnected through the flows of people, goods, and information, many challenges are becoming more difficult to address since human needs are increasingly being met through global supply chains. Global shocks (e.g., war, economic recession, pandemic) can severely disrupt these interconnections and generate cascading consequences across local to global scales. To comprehensively evaluate these consequences, it is crucial to use integrated frameworks that consider multiple interconnections and flows among coupled human and natural systems. Here we use the framework of metacoupling (human–nature interactions within as well as across adjacent and distant systems) to illustrate the effects of major global shocks on the evolution of global interconnectedness between the early 1900s and the 2010s. Based on these results we make a few actionable recommendations to reduce the negative impacts of an ongoing global shock, the COVID-19 pandemic, to promote global sustainability.","Viña A., Liu J.",Effects of global shocks on the evolution of an interconnected world,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136602043&doi=10.1007%2fs13280-022-01778-0&partnerID=40&md5=afea037872efcbc2150b54e0e2ba28e7
Sustainability (Switzerland),"As the world is moving into a sustainable era, achieving zero hunger has become one of the top three Sustainable Development Goals, applying a considerable amount of pressure on the agri-food systems to make decisions contemplating the sustainability dimensions. Accordingly, making effective supply chain decisions holistically while achieving sustainability goals has become a major challenge faced by the present agri-food systems. Thus, to address the challenge, a novel supply chain configuration addressing multiple supply chain decisions to reduce global warming potential (GWP) and post-harvest losses have been presented by taking the banana supply chain in Sri Lanka as a case study. In the proposed approach, farmers have been clustered based on their geo positions using K-Means clustering followed by route planning within clusters using a heuristics approach. Retailer points are catered by assigning to wholesalers optimally modeling as an assignment model and then route planning executed using a heuristic approach. The solution generated from the above approaches has been implemented on a simulation platform to calculate the overall supply chain performance including the transportation component, in terms of the net GWP, post-harvest losses, and lead time including routing operations. Simulated supply chain performance has been compared with the existing system and verified the performance of the proposed supply chain configuration. The suggested configuration has reduced the net GWP by 15.3%, post-harvest loss by 2.1%, lead time by 28.2%, and travel distance by 20.47%. The proposed configuration can be further improved by adding dynamic characteristics to the model.","Chandrasiri C., Dharmapriya S., Jayawardana J., Kulatunga A.K., Weerasinghe A.N., Aluwihare C.P., Hettiarachchi D.",Mitigating Environmental Impact of Perishable Food Supply Chain by a Novel Configuration: Simulating Banana Supply Chain in Sri Lanka,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139912604&doi=10.3390%2fsu141912060&partnerID=40&md5=eb00e902a53cf613e42ed4b378aa5dbd
Sadhana - Academy Proceedings in Engineering Sciences,"Assessing the sustainability efficiency of a supply chain network (SCN) is a complex issue due to the inherent conflict of interest among components. In these systems, there are two levels of conflict of interest: on the one hand, network players, including suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, etc., have conflicting interests. On the other hand, the three sustainability goals, namely economic, social and environmental, are not in line with each other. Improvement in one of these goals is not possible while keeping the others constant. Using hybrid models of game network data envelopment analysis (GNDEA), this study presented a new framework to measure an Iranian pharmaceutical company’s supply chain network sustainability efficiency (SCNSE). This was done considering two levels of conflict of interest simultaneously, which is the main contribution of this study. The proposed model also measures the performance of components and the entire network in all three dimensions of sustainability. It enables managers to gain a better insight into the sustainability efficiency of an SCN and its individual components. Acquiring this knowledge allows managers to identify system weaknesses and design more effective improvement plans. Future studies can develop models for appraising the sustainability efficiency of an SCN under uncertain conditions considering different players.","Yaghoubizadeh Vanini M., Yousefi Zenouz R., Abtahi A.-R., Khalili-Damghani K.","A study into the sustainability efficiency of supply chain network based on economic, social, and environmental trade-offs",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135612221&doi=10.1007%2fs12046-022-01927-x&partnerID=40&md5=1f461a0c8aef010ce75df51ac93e89d0
Sustainability (Switzerland),"At the current worrisome rate of global consumption, the linear economy model of producing goods, using them, and then disposing of them with no thought of the environmental, social, or economic consequences, is unsustainable and points to a deeply flawed manufacturing framework. Circular economy (CE) is presented as an alternative framework to address the management of emissions, scarcity of resources, and economic sustainability such that the resources are kept ‘in the loop’. In the context of manufacturing supply chains (SCs), the 6R’s of rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, repair, and recycle have been proposed in line with the achievement of targeted net-zero emissions. In order to bring that about, the required changes in the framework for assessing the state of manufacturing SCs with regard to sustainability are indispensable. Verifiable and empirical model-based approaches such as modeling and simulation (M&S) techniques find pronounced use in realizing the ideal of CE. The simulation models find extensive use across various aspects of SCs, including analysis of the impacts, and support for optimal re-design and operation. Using the PRISMA framework to sift through published research, as gathered from SCOPUS, this review is based on 202 research papers spanning from 2015 to the present. This review provides an overview of the simulation tools being put to use in the context of sustainability in the manufacturing SCs, such that various aspects and contours of the collected research articles spanning from 2015 to the present, are highlighted. This article focuses on the three major simulation techniques in the literature, namely, Discrete Event Simulation (DES), Agent-Based Simulation (ABS), and System Dynamics (SD). With regards to their application in manufacturing SCs, each modeling technique has its pros and its cons which are evinced in case of data requirement, model magnification, model resolution, and environment interaction, among others. These limitations are remedied through use of hybrids wherein two or more than two modeling techniques are applied for the desired results. The article also indicates various open-source software solutions that are being employed in research and the industry. This article, in essence, has three objectives. First to present to the prospective researchers, the current state of research, the concerns that have been presented in the field of sustainability modeling, and how they have been resolved. Secondly, it serves as a comprehensive bibliography of peer-reviewed research published from 2015–2022 and, finally, indicating the limitations of the techniques with regards to sustainability assessment.

However, in the era of digitalization and globalization many researchers explored the role of digital technologies in improving sustainable performance. However, the literature on the role of collaboration and coordination in a digitally enabled supply chain (SC) to achieve sustainability is still lacking. This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain collaboration and coordination (SCC), sustainable development strategy (SDS), digital transformation (DIT), and collaborative advantages (COA) on sustainable supply chain firm performance (SSCFP). The conceptual model is based on the relational view (RV), transaction cost economics (TCE), technology, organization and environment (TOE), and resource-based view (RBV) theories. This study utilizes structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze data collected from 361 respondents of the automotive industry in India. The findings show that SCC positively affects SDS and DIT. SDS positively affects DIT, COA, and DIT positively affects SSCFP. DIT fully mediates the relationship between SCC and COA. The study suggests that managers can apply SCC, SDS, and DIT in series to achieve sustainable performance. However, the COA can only be enhanced in the digitalized SC.

In this article, we synthesize the current state of knowledge about the impacts of avocado production in Michoacán, México, the global center of avocado production. Environmental impacts on biodiversity, soil, and hydrological systems stem from deforestation and forest fragmentation that result from avocado expansion. The avocado industry has brought some economic benefits, namely increased employment and reductions in poverty and out-migration, but inequity in the region limits the positive socioeconomic impacts. We draw comparisons to other commodity studies and propose that lessons learned from such research could be utilized to make the avocado supply chain more sustainable.

Textile Progress,"Awareness of the harmful effects of chemical substances is gradually increasing and scientific investigations have time and again revealed the negative influences of the chemicals conventionally used. This has led to restricting the use of certain chemicals and dyes in textile wet treatments. Globally there has been an acceptance of this by branding agencies and retailers. Government organisations have also supported these restrictions, and curtailment in such chemical usage has now become the norm throughout the textile supply chain. This issue of Textile Progress reviews the chronological evolution of the restrictions leading to the concepts of RSL (Restricted Substances List) and MRSL (Manufacturing Restricted Substances List) now widely followed. The listing of harmful chemicals under Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) is also discussed. The major chemicals or groups of chemicals facing restriction are dealt with in detail, covering their usage, hazards, sources, chemistry and possible substitutes (if any). Examples such as the alkyl phenols and alkyl phenol ethoxylates used for decades as detergents and wetting agents in preparatory processes, dyeing and printing were found to be potential hormone disruptors and very toxic to aquatic life, and substitutes have been put in place. Substances such as azo-amines, chlorophenols, formaldehyde, brominated flame retardants, heavy metals and fluorochemicals also have their share of adverse effects on human health and environment and need to be avoided. Studies have shown the presence of phthalates in routinely-used chemicals which can be traced back to the manufacturing process itself and other hazardous chemicals such as bisphenols, chloroparaffins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, quinoline, VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), biocides and UV absorbers have also figured in discussions.

African Health Sciences,"Background: Despite significant global progress towards decreased child mortality in past decades, maternal and child mortality continues to be high, especially in sub Saharan Africa. Most of these deaths are preventable with known interventions. Community health workers (CHWs) are well-positioned to promote these life-saving interventions; however, sustaining CHW programs remains a challenge. Methods: A sustainability-focused qualitative evaluation, was done between July and August 2018 in 2 rural districts in southwest Uganda. Using semi-structured interview tools, we conducted 6 Focus Group discussions (FGDs) with CHWs and 17 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with various district stakeholders to gain insights into factors affecting sustainability of a district-wide maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH)-oriented CHW intervention. Data was managed using NVivo software (version 12) with themes using thematic analysis. Results: Identified factors impacting CHW program sustainability included ‘health system effectiveness’ (availability of supplies, medicines and services and availability of facility health providers), CHW program-related factors’ (CHW selection and training, CHW recognition), ‘community attitudes and beliefs’ and ‘stakeholder engagement’.

Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,"Background: Effective population-based strategies are required to move toward healthy sustainable diets that replace a proportion of animal- with plant-based protein. Food service can support this using a variety of strategies across the food supply chain. Objective: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies to decrease animal protein and/or increase plant protein in foodservice settings on uptake, satisfaction, financial, environmental, and dietary intake outcomes. Methods: Seven databases were searched in November 2020 with no restriction on study dates to identify peer-reviewed study designs conducted in commercial and institutional food services using any strategy to decrease beef, lamb, pork, poultry, eggs, fish, or seafood and/or increase legumes/pulses and legume/pulse-based meat substitutes or nuts and reported this review's primary outcome, uptake by consumers, either quantitatively or qualitatively. Secondary outcomes were satisfaction and financial, environmental, and dietary intake outcomes. Titles/abstracts then full texts were screened independently by 2 authors. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used for quality appraisal. Results were described using a narrative synthesis by strategy type. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021235015). Results: From 20,002 records identified, 38 studies met eligibility criteria, of which 16% were high quality. Strategies included forced restriction (n = 4), menu redesign (n = 6), recipe redesign (n = 6), service redesign (n = 4), menu labeling (n = 7), prompt at point of sale (n = 7), and multipronged strategies (n = 4). Menu labeling, prompting at the point of sale, and redesigning menus, recipes, and service increased uptake of target foods in most studies with the largest consistent changes in menu redesign. Few studies explored secondary outcomes. Recipe redesign, prompting at the point of sale, and menu labeling strategies that measured satisfaction found a positive or neutral effect. Conclusions: The most promising strategies are likely in menu redesign, followed by menu labeling and service redesign. Satisfaction appears to not be negatively impacted by recipe redesign, prompting at the point of sale and menu labeling.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture,"BACKGROUND: Extensive research shows that replacing animal protein with plant-based protein in the diet would strongly alleviate the environmental impact of the food system. However, much less attention has been given to the socio-economic considerations of dietary transitions. This study analyses the socio-economic performance of innovative legume-based food prototypes, developed in the Protein2Food research project, and conventional animal-based products (chicken meat and dairy milk). We implement a social life cycle assessment (sLCA) to quantify and compare their potential socio-economic impacts along the entire life cycle. RESULTS: Findings from this analysis show that legume-based prototypes and their respective animal-based counterparts have, overall, a comparable socio-economic performance. Looking at the disaggregated life cycle stages, socio-economic hotspots (points of most negative impacts) were mainly identified at the production stage in legume-based products. Farm-level net margin and profitability are low when compared with their animal equivalents. However, at the processing stage, there are socio-economic gains for plant-based products regarding lower unemployment rates. Finally, at the consumption stage, there are mixed results. Plant-based products show worse protein affordability but better nutritional contents (lower saturated fat and cholesterol) than their animal counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: To improve socio-economic performance of legume-based foods, greater emphasis should be placed upon developing improved processing technologies and supply chains. This would broaden the supply of sustainable protein-rich food options and make these products more economically attractive. The research illustrates that policies should be targeted to the different stages of the food value chain to optimize the development of innovative plant-based foods.","Varela-Ortega C., Blanco-Gutiérrez I., Manners R., Detzel A.",Life cycle assessment of animal-based foods and plant-based protein-rich alternatives: a socio-economic perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120496402&doi=10.1002%2fjsfa.11655&partnerID=40&md5=eca7afb21bc05a706e539829d59e4bdb
Trends in Food Science and Technology,"Background: Incidence of postharvest losses in the fresh produce value chain is a worldwide concern facing food security and sustainability. Postharvest losses can occur along the supply chain stages such as harvesting, storing, handling, packaging, transporting, and marketing. Mechanical damage caused by vibration is one of the most common quality challenges to fresh produce during transit. Scope and approach: Mechanical damage of fresh produce can cause considerable economic losses by reducing quality and can result in severe food safety concerns. Understanding the factors affecting fresh produce damage during transportation is significant in developing strategies for reducing postharvest losses. We review transport as an essential component in the postharvest supply chain and critically discuss the adverse effect on fresh produce, mainly due to vibration. Key findings and conclusions: The experimental approaches applied to measure the vibration levels during transport of fresh produce are presented. Factors influencing the vibration level discussed herein include surface condition, vehicle speed, vibration duration, vibration direction, packaging unit, etc. A comprehensive discussion on the effects of packing unit type and surface of packaging material, location of the package on the vehicle, and height of the package in a stack on the vibration level is presented. Vibration during transportation is difficult to avoid; however, applying good management practices like improving the refrigeration system, utilization of appropriate packaging, and incorporating suitable cushioning materials can reduce produce damage during transit. Overall, careful selection of better solutions to this critical issue can help to reduce fresh produce susceptibility to vibration damage during road transport and thereby reduce incidence of postharvest losses of fresh commodities.","Al-Dairi M., Pathare P.B., Al-Yahyai R., Opara U.L.",Mechanical damage of fresh produce in postharvest transportation: Current status and future prospects,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129857952&doi=10.1016%2fj.tifs.2022.04.018&partnerID=40&md5=bca18ec39c13bef446525ab335ba4493
Eurobiotech Journal,"Background: Industrial Biotechnology (""White Biotechnology"") is the large-scale production of materials and chemicals using renewable raw materials along with biocatalysts like enzymes derived from microorganisms or by using microorganisms themselves (""whole cell biocatalysis""). While the production of ethanol has existed for several millennia and can be considered a product of Industrial Biotechnology, the application of complex and engineered biocatalysts to produce industrial scale products with acceptable economics is only a few decades old. Bioethanol as fuel, lactic acid as food and PolyHydroxyAlkanoates (PHA) as a processible material are some examples of products derived from Industrial Biotechnology. Purpose and Scope: Industrial Biotechnology is the sector of biotechnology that holds the most promise in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental degradation caused by pollution, since all products that are made today from fossil carbon feedstocks could be manufactured using Industrial Biotechnology - renewable carbon feedstocks and biocatalysts. To match the economics of fossil-based bulk products, Industrial Biotechnology-based processes must be sufficiently robust. This aspect continues to evolve with increased technological capabilities to engineer biocatalysts (including microorganisms) and the decreasing relative price difference between renewable and fossil carbon feedstocks. While there have been major successes in manufacturing products from Industrial Biotechnology, challenges exist, although its promise is real. Here, PHA biopolymers are a class of product that is fulfilling this promise. Summary and Conclusion: The authors illustrate the benefits and challenges of Industrial Biotechnology, the circularity and sustainability of such processes, its role in reducing supply chain issues, and alleviating societal problems like poverty and hunger. With increasing awareness among the general public and policy makers of the dangers posed by climate change, pollution and persistent societal issues, Industrial Biotechnology holds the promise of solving these major problems and is poised for a transformative upswing in the manufacture of bulk chemicals and materials from renewable feedstocks and biocatalysts.","Mukherjee A., Koller M.",Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) Biopolyesters - Emerging and Major Products of Industrial Biotechnology,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129759210&doi=10.2478%2febtj-2022-0007&partnerID=40&md5=4f0c1e89b2ee051c4f68fbe647af7047
South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences,"Background: Manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are facing new challenges that compel them to outperform their competitors economically, and to consider environmental and social impacts. Customer demands regarding sustainability are channelled upstream to these manufacturers through retailers. This resulted in manufacturers being very conscious of the sustainability of their production processes, as well as their packaging. To that extent, FMCG manufacturers are encouraged to integrate sustainability, with other supply chain partners, to improve sustainability performance across the supply chain. Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which FMCG manufacturers in South Africa apply sustainability to their supply chain integration. Setting: The study was conducted among South African FMCG manufacturers. Method: The study applied a generic qualitative research design. Altogether 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted with middle to senior supply chain managers. Results: Having a clear sustainability focus, supported by leadership and embedded into the corporate culture, is key to integrating sustainability internally and thus improving the sustainability performance. The findings indicate that customers do not pressure firms to adhere to their sustainability expectations. Instead, sustainability expectations are driven internally. Firms find it difficult to align the three sustainability aspects equally, due to the local variables and context in which they operate. Therefore, economic sustainability is considered most important and firms act on environmental and social sustainability aspects within strict economic constraints. Conclusion: Academically, the study adds to the literature by creating an understanding of sustainable supply chain integration (SSCI) from a South African perspective. For practitioners, the study encourages firms to collaborate with supply chain partners on sustainability, as this opens up opportunities to create shared value through joint sustainability problem-solving.","Ebrahim S., Niemann W., Kotzé T.",Sustainable supply chain integration: An exploration of South African fast-moving consumer goods manufacturers,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131200293&doi=10.4102%2fsajems.v25i1.4192&partnerID=40&md5=65cfcdabcf58b1bdbb3aa221f710030d
Trends in Food Science and Technology,"Background: Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are relevant commodities in the market due to their important role in human wellbeing. As the worldwide demand is increasing, alternative sources and sustainable processes are needed to face the limited supply of the omega-3 FAs of fish origin. Microalgae provide a portfolio of biodiversity able to satisfy the quest for alternative sources and to match the need of sustainability for the production of these compounds. Scope and approach: This review deepens the topic of sustainable production and supply chain by analyzing the current data available in scientific literature and providing a glance of the market of omega-3 FAs from different microalgal species. This was assessed in the light of the technologies applicable to enhance and improve production. We analyzed and compared how traditional and innovative biotechnological approaches are exploited to maximize the ability of microalgae to produce omega-3 FAs, especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA and DHA). Key findings and conclusions: This critical overview highlights that microalgal bioprospecting, combined with engineering approaches and with the study of the influence from the environment, can provide a reliable and sustainable alternative for omega-3 FAs production. Unlocking the interdependence of these factors will play a key role in achieving the industrial scalability and standardization of the processes. Finally, the strategy to promote the consumer's acceptability of algae-based products will also be pivotal to substitute the current sources of omega-3 FAs and therefore to address the sustainability challenges that Europe, as well as the rest of the world, is facing.","Magoni C., Bertacchi S., Giustra C.M., Guzzetti L., Cozza R., Ferrari M., Torelli A., Marieschi M., Porro D., Branduardi P., Labra M.",Could microalgae be a strategic choice for responding to the demand for omega-3 fatty acids?

Trends in Food Science and Technology,"Background: Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, China and spread to other countries and continents causing a variety of respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms which led to death in severe cases. Scope and approach: In this review, we discuss and analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on animal production systems and food production of meat, dairy, eggs, and processed food, in addition to assessing the impact of the pandemic on animal healthcare systems, animal healthcare quality, animal welfare, food chain sustainability, and the global economy. We also provide effective recommendations to animal producers, veterinary healthcare professionals, workers in animal products industries, and governments to alleviate the effects of the pandemic on livestock farming and production systems. Key findings and conclusions: Port restrictions, border restrictions, curfews, and social distancing limitations led to reduced quality, productivity, and competitiveness of key productive sectors. The restrictions have hit the livestock sector hard by disrupting the animal feed supply chain, reducing animal farming services, limiting animal health services including delays in diagnosis and treatment of diseases, limiting access to markets and consumers, and reducing labor-force participation. The inhumane culling of animals jeopardized animal welfare. Egg smashing, milk dumping, and other animal product disruptions negatively impacted food production, consumption, and access to food originating from animals. In summary, COVID-19 triggered lockdowns and limitations on local and international trade have taken their toll on food production, animal production, and animal health and welfare. COVID-19 reverberations could exacerbate food insecurity, hunger, and global poverty. The effects could be massive on the most vulnerable populations and the poorest nations.","Rahimi P., Islam M.S., Duarte P.M., Tazerji S.S., Sobur M.A., El Zowalaty M.E., Ashour H.M., Rahman M.T.",Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food production and animal health,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124234743&doi=10.1016%2fj.tifs.2021.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=0c7257eb74d3fd8bc9bf69f10d38f10f
Environmental Evidence,"Background: Smallholding plantations represent approximately 40% of the total palm oil plantation area globally. For any certifications, standards, and other instruments to achieve more ethical and sustainable palm oil supply chains, it is essential to improve smallholder engagement in the schemes. A large body of research has built up our understanding of the challenges of engaging smallholders in sustainability initiatives in various sites and countries. A broad systematic understanding of how different types of sustainability initiatives can support or restrict smallholders from access to market and different resources and under which economic and social conditions are not yet developed. This systematic map aims to identify, map, and describe the body of evidence that exists on the positive and negative impacts of sustainability initiatives on smallholder engagement in palm oil practices in Southeast Asia. The findings are expected to inform policies and practices on smallholder engagement in sustainable palm oil supply chains and identify evidence gaps where future primary studies and evidence syntheses can contribute. Methods: We will develop a guiding framework of interventions through other works on supply chain instruments. We will then construct a test library of 39 items through field expert consultations and snowballing using literature search algorithms. The search will cover four publication databases, five bibliographic databases, and 13 topical and organizational websites. We will search for existing evidence syntheses and primary research studies in Southeast Asia countries published between 2008 and 2021. This systematic map will only include English language articles due to our limited capacity. We will screen the search results at the title/abstract and the full-text levels. Numbers of included/excluded items and reasons for exclusion will be noted and visualized via a ROSES flow diagram. We will develop a data extraction form for assessing data useful for reporting current trends of smallholder engagement in sustainable palm oil initiatives. A random sample of 20% of the included articles will be assessed for validity using Joanne Briggs Institute’s critical appraisal checklist. We will then organize and summarize the data according to the defined PICO.","Lai J.Y., Mardiyaningsih D.I., Rahmadian F., Hamzah N.",What evidence exists on the impact of sustainability initiatives on smallholder engagement in sustainable palm oil practices in Southeast Asia: a systematic map protocol,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137506334&doi=10.1186%2fs13750-022-00283-x&partnerID=40&md5=8da1e6572b39e277b8e3bee34b70fb93
International Journal of Mechanical Engineering,"Background: Supply chain is very important for the sustainable development of an industry. At all scales, they must be able to run and develop their business supply chains well to achieve good sustainability. Because operations at all scales are unrestricted and the structure is complex, the complexity of implementing the supply chain model is also very complex. Supply chain performance measurement will greatly assist supply chain operations and development. The purpose of this study is to analyze the causes of supply chain flow obstruction and improve supply chain performance. Methods: The method used in measuring supply chain performance is the SCOR and AHP methods with the help of expert choice software. The measurement of supply chain performance obtained in the study is that there are 43 indicators. Result: Based on the research results, the company's supply chain performance indicators that need improvement and are prioritized are the indicators that get the lowest score. From the results of data processing, the level of importance of the existing criteria is at level 1 which is deliver with a weight of 1.89, level 2 is cost with a weight of 1.46, and level 3 is DC1 (message cost management) with a weight of 0.75.

Logforum,"Background: The adoption of lean and green practices, sequentially or simultaneously, in the context of supply chain management has been recommended by researchers and practitioners as strategies to gain a sustainable competitive advantage while reducing negative social and environmental impacts. Hence, there is a growing interest in this topic. This attention is evident through the increased number of publications on lean and green supply chain practices. However, only a few studies have listed and classified these practices according to the different levels of the supply chain. Moreover, there is a restricted number of research papers that have highlighted the specific practices that impact each measurement of sustainable performance. Thus, this research aims to contribute to the literature in the field of supply chain management by presenting, in a simple and structured way, the different lean and green practices that have been studied by previous researchers, focusing on their impact on sustainable performance measurements. Methods: A rigorous literature review in seven steps was followed, based on the study and analysis of 23 research articles dealing with lean and green practices and their impact on the supply chain’s sustainable performance. Results: The novelty of this research is that it presents, at the same time (i) a review of lean and green practices used in the context of supply chain management, and classified based on their citation frequency and level of use (upstream, internal and downstream), (ii) a focus on the practices that have been empirically studied as having an impact on supply chain’s sustainable performance, as well as highlighting the indicators that are directly influenced by these practices, and (iii) a development of a conceptual framework, to present in a simplified way the lean and green practices that have an impact on one or more sustainable performance dimensions. The results of the study indicated that regarding the different levels of the supply chain, there is a dominance of practices used internally, with a greater number of lean practices compared to green practices. In addition, the majority of the practices identified have a positive impact on sustainable performance, except for some practices, namely « Cooperation with suppliers », « JIT philosophy », « Total Productive Maintenance », « Small lot-sizing » and « Reverse logistics », that have shown a disagreement between previous studies. It was concluded that the supply chain’s environmental performance aspects are the most studied, followed by economic performance, then social performance Conclusions: Numerous recommendations are provided to help managers and decision-makers in their choices of lean and green strategies according to their sustainability objectives, and to guide academics in their future studies on this field.","Ikram A.H., Salah O., Ali H.",THE IMPACT OF LEAN & GREEN SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES ON SUSTAINABILITY: LITERATURE REVIEW AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126474877&doi=10.17270%2fJ.LOG.2022.684&partnerID=40&md5=d2d66285fe8b7a1155984b95eb9e7e3b
BMC Public Health,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health restrictions temporarily disrupted food supply chains around the world and changed the way people shopped for food, highlighting issues with food systems resilience and sustainability. The aim of this study was to explore consumer-driven strategies towards a more resilient and sustainable food system in Australia, learning from experiences during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: During May–June 2020, a cross-sectional, online survey was conducted in Tasmania, Australia in a non-random sample of adults aged 18 years and over. The survey collected demographic data and posted the open-ended question: “How could Tasmania’s food system be better prepared for a disaster in the future?” Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the demographic data and thematic analysis was employed to analyse the qualitative data. Results: Survey respondents (n = 698) were predominantly female (79%), over 55 years of age (48%), university educated (70%) and living with dependents (45%). Seven key themes were identified: (i) balance food exports with local needs; (ii) strengthen local food systems; (iii) increase consumer awareness of food supply chains; (iv) build collaboration and connection in the food system; (v) embed clear contingency arrangements; (vi) support community capacity building and individual self-sufficiency; and (vii) the food system coped well. Conclusions: The consumer-driven strategies identified indicate multiple opportunities to increase resilience and sustainability in the food system to avoid future supply disruptions. Our findings indicate that considerable popular support for more resilient, local and sustainable food systems may be emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kent K., Gale F., Penrose B., Auckland S., Lester E., Murray S.",Consumer-driven strategies towards a resilient and sustainable food system following the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135809495&doi=10.1186%2fs12889-022-13987-z&partnerID=40&md5=efcc549da10f49b2f3423f6acf890ec1
Tropical and Subtropical Agroecosystems,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic evidenced the fragility of the agri-food sector by affecting the food supply chains which directly depend on the health of its main actors. In this context, countries need to rethink the agricultural production models, considering environmental and human health as priorities to achieve food safety. Aim: Systematically review the state of the art regarding the role of agricultural genetic resources as a source of resilience in the face of events such as the present pandemic as a point of reflection for the identification of opportunities for the restructuring of regional agriculture sensitive to nutrition for health. Methodology: Exhaustive search and analysis of documentary information regarding the effects of COVID-19 on the agri-food sector and the role of agricultural genetic resources in the current pandemic were conducted. Then, through an analysis of the occurrence and association of the main terms addressed in the literature considered, the thematic axes were drawn to address the central discussion of the systematic review. Results: Terms co-occurrence analysis corroborated the relevance and pertinence of the topic addressed. Additionally, the importance of the conservation of agricultural genetic resources and implementation of sustainable agriculture models, as a source of resilience to pandemics, was visualized. The discussion addressed the impact of the pandemic on the Mexican agri-food sector and the restructuring of post-COVID-19 agriculture through the nation and nutrition-sensitive agriculture for health approaches. Implications: The exhaustive analysis of the relationship COVID-19-agricultural genetic resources-health in Mexico highlights the need for the generation of agricultural policies and the increase in multidisciplinary research that favors biodiversity as a source of sustainability, productivity, and health for agroecosystems and the welfare of humanity. Conclusions: A fatalistic scenario for humanity seems to be dissipating in the face of the possibilities of rethinking the economic, social, and agricultural systems from the approaches of the nation and nutrition-sensitive agriculture for health, where, through the responsible use of agricultural resources it is possible to rebuild an agri-food production system with a tendency to resilience to events such as the current pandemic caused by the COVID-19 disease.","Sandoval-Cancino G., Zelaya-Molina L.X., Ruíz-Ramírez S., Cruz-Cárdenas C.I., Aragón-Magadán M.A., Rojas-Anaya E., Chávez-Díaz I.F.",AGRICULTURAL GENETIC RESOURCES AS A SOURCE OF RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN MEXICO † [RECURSOS GENÉTICOS AGRÍCOLAS COMO FUENTE DE RESILIENCIA ANTE LA PANDEMIA DE COVID-19 EN MÉXICO],https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126549245&partnerID=40&md5=7f679a6f11a34c9b0528d03e1dc11917
Trends in Food Science and Technology,"Background: The dairy industry requires substantial energy resources at all stages of production and supply to meet consumer needs in terms of quantity, quality and food safety. The expected future climate change effects will cause serious uncertainty to the dairy industry. Adapting to these upcoming conditions is a challenge and one that is compounded by the continuous increase in food demand, as a result of global population growth. Predictably, under current conditions, this situation might lead to a significant increase in the energy requirements of the dairy industry. Therefore, there is a clear need to mitigate energy use through enhanced energy conservation, waste reduction and waste management. Scope and approach: This review paper presents and discusses alternative dairy operations and mitigation strategies that have the potential to lead the dairy industry towards net-zero carbon emissions. Further, the focus of this work turns to supply chain energy modelling (SCEM) as means to mitigate energy use, while relevant work in the literature is reviewed. Key findings and conclusions: Supply chain energy models can provide a complete overview of the energy demand and the energy mix of a dairy supply chain. Additionally, they can highlight the most energy consuming processes and allow the evaluation of alternative energy-saving operations that can lead towards the net-zero carbon target.

However, little is known about the specific sustainability factors employed by healthcare supply chain managers when selecting medical materials vendors in developing economies, and the impact that such selection approaches has on the buying firm’s performance. Objective: This study examines the sustainability factors mostly considered by Nigerian healthcare supply chain managers in their supplier selection processes. It further assesses the supply chain performance impact of the identified sustainable supplier selection factors. Methodology: The study adopted a quantitative survey approach to randomly collect and analyse primary data from a large sample of 116 logistics and supply chain executives in 58 healthcare organisations in Nigeria. The descriptive scores (mean and standard deviation) were summarised and used to estimate the relationship among variables. Results: Overall, the results suggest that economic sustainability towers above other sustainability factors for the selection of healthcare suppliers in the context of this study. In addition, economically sustainable supplier selection correlates strongly and positively with supply chain performance, while social sustainability supplier selection had moderate correlation with performance.

"Energy, Sustainability and Society","Background: Urban energy systems are responsible for 75% of the world’s energy consumption and for 70% of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Energy system models are used to optimize, benchmark and compare such energy systems with the help of energy sustainability indicators. We discuss several indicators for their basic suitability and their response to changing boundary conditions, system structures and reference values. The most suitable parameters are applied to four different supply scenarios of a real-world urban energy system. Results: There is a number of energy sustainability indicators, but not all of them are suitable for the use in urban energy system optimization models. Shortcomings originate from the omission of upstream energy supply chains (secondary energy efficiency), from limited capabilities to compare small energy systems (energy productivity), from excessive accounting expense (regeneration rate), from unsuitable accounting methods (primary energy efficiency), from a questionable impact of some indicators on the overall system sustainability (self-sufficiency), from the lack of detailed information content (share of renewables), and more. On the other hand, indicators of absolute greenhouse gas emissions, energy costs, and final energy demand are well suitable for the use in optimization models. However, each of these indicators only represents partial aspects of energy sustainability; the use of only one indicator in the optimization process increases the risk that other important aspects will deteriorate significantly, eventually leading to suboptimal or even unrealistic scenarios in practice. Therefore, multi-criteria approaches should be used to enable a more holistic optimization and planning of sustainable urban energy systems. Conclusion: We recommend multi-criteria optimization approaches using the indicators of absolute greenhouse gas emissions, absolute energy costs, and absolute energy demand. For benchmarking and comparison purposes, specific indicators should be used and therefore related to the final energy demand, respectively, the number of inhabitants. Our example scenarios demonstrate modeling strategies to optimize sustainability of urban energy systems.","Klemm C., Wiese F.",Indicators for the optimization of sustainable urban energy systems based on energy system modeling,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122498467&doi=10.1186%2fs13705-021-00323-3&partnerID=40&md5=a12804b62f3c6c3872ffce46df9e4dfc
Logforum,"Background: With the emergence of supply chain management as a key strategic function in the agri-food sector, a lot of research has been conducted to find ways to improve the performance and sustainability of agri-food supply chains. The Triple-A Supply Chain concept, which refers to the agility, adaptability, and alignment of the supply chains, has been a field of study for various researchers aiming at shaping meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages for businesses and organizations in various sectors. Over the years, alternative, complementary, or upgraded versions of this approach have been proposed, such as the “New AAA Supply Chain”, whi ch describes the renewed Triple-A Supply Chain model based on Super-Agility, Architectural Adaptability, and Ecosystem Alignment, and the “Triple A & R” framework, which refers to Agility for Robustness, Adaptability, and Resilience, and Re-Alignment. Methods: This paper presents the results of a selective study of the bibliography considering the Triple-A Supply Chain model, the “New AAA Supply Chain” model and the “Triple A & R” framework. These frameworks are analyzed and compared with each other considering their principles, and their implementation in the agri-food sector is researched. The scope of this study is to analyze the potential of the application and suitability of these frameworks in agri-food supply chains, having considered the particularities of the sector. Results: Examining the models concerning the evolution of the Triple-A Supply Chain paradigm, it is evident that they differ from each other, as they approach supply chain management from different viewpoints. Conclusions: The potential of application of various models originating from the Triple-A Supply Chain paradigm was examined in the case of the agri-food sector considering product nature, sustainability, and investment cost as the factors affecting it. These frameworks could partially find application in the agri-food sector, as some of their guidelines promote the increase of the agri-food supply chain effectiveness.","Kontopanou M., Tsoulfas G.",ANALYZING NEW WAYS TO ADAPT THE TRIPLE-A SUPPLY CHAIN MODEL AND ITS EXTENSIONS IN AGRI-FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139431557&doi=10.17270%2fJ.LOG.2022.735&partnerID=40&md5=e2a4e8fb40bdb580cc79c2ec235d3da2
Logforum,"Backgrounds: The presented research deals with the investigation of how big data analytics can help predict possible disruptive events in supply chains. The supply chain can be considered a complex system with a wide spectrum of possible sources of internal and external disruptions. Since the individual entities of the supply chains operate in a particular environment and interact with this environment, there is a certain level of mutual interdependency. This set of interconnected interactions within the supply chain will be the unit of analysis. Methods: There are many internal and external sources of supply chain disruption, which opens up the potential application of Big Data Analysis (BDA) as an early warning tool. To analyse the possible application of the BDA to identify sources of supply chain disruptions, we conduct a bibliometric analysis to define an appropriate structure for supply chain risk classification as well as appropriate keywords that make data collection quicker and easier. The DOTMLPFI methodology was used to systematically identify the most relevant risks threatening the supply chains. Results: The proposed research approach creates a possible framework to support the operational sustainability and resilience of the supply chain as a system, toward internal and external disruptions. The research results also point out the most explored attributes of supply chain disruption. The conducted bibliometric research and content analysis support the theoretical framework of using BDA as a possible early warning tool, especially for the identification of possible sources of supply chain disruption. The approach of grouping Big Data sources into categories based on DOTMLPFI groups allows to identify the appropriate keywords for their later BDA analysis. The analytical framework provides a starting point for individual supply chain entities to understand risks and systematically collect the appropriate data in the required structure about them. Conclusion: The complexity of supply chains, together with the increasing possibility of digital applications, requires a new analytical framework for evaluating the overall supply chain, with the possible application of new data sources and analytical approaches regarding the risks threatening the chain. DOTMLPFI methodology allows covering all the relevant categories of supply chain risks, and by proposing relevant keywords and data sources it can help companies to find the appropriate open-source, up-to-date information and be prepared for disruptive events.","Nagy J., Foltin P., Ondryhal V.",USE OF BIG DATA ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION THROUGH THE DOTMLPFI METHOD,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139386056&doi=10.17270%2fJ.LOG.2022.731&partnerID=40&md5=409a72ac169dd828c54bc483f43b0999

Understanding the material properties of the battery components—anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator—and their interaction is necessary to establish selection criteria based on their correlations with the battery metrics: capacity, current density, and cycle life. This review studies material used in the four battery components from the perspective and the impact of seven ions (Li (Formula presented.), Na (Formula presented.), K (Formula presented.), Zn (Formula presented.), Ca (Formula presented.), Mg (Formula presented.), and Al (Formula presented.)), employed in commercial and research batteries. In addition, critical factors of sustainability of the supply chains—geographical raw materials origins vs. battery manufacturing companies and material properties (Young’s modulus vs. electric conductivity)—are mapped. These are key aspects toward identifying the supply chain vulnerabilities and gaps for batteries. In addition, two battery applications, smartphones and electric vehicles, in light of challenges in the current research, commercial fronts, and technical prospects, are discussed. Bringing the next generation of batteries necessitates a transition from advances in material to addressing the technical challenges, which the review has powered.","Pantoja W., Perez-Taborda J.A., Avila A.",Tug-of-War in the Selection of Materials for Battery Technologies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138746801&doi=10.3390%2fbatteries8090105&partnerID=40&md5=4b38ac9dd9440e833d2553bd809c7440
"Resources, Conservation and Recycling Advances","Bauxite residue (BR), simultaneously an environmental challenge as well as known to be a secondary resource for resources various valuable metals like Ti, V, Ga, and rare earth metal (REM). Lack of understanding and technology detects BR to be stockpiled which is counterproductive considering the environment, land scarcity, and management of BR inventories. As BR remains unexploited, significant amounts of REMs in BR remain unlocked, which are critical metals from green energy, environmental sustainability, and supply chain bottleneck perspective. Our current investigation analyses the potential of BR as secondary resources and quantity and worth of REM being remains unlocked. The quantitative content of global bauxite, alumina, and BR production during the last 5 decades have been analyzed. Also, plausible BR generation in the next 3 decades has been estimated. Considering the content of REM in BR amount of REM either stockpiled or to be stockpiled along with BR has been analyzed. Our study indicated about 9.14 million tons of REM remain locked in the stockpiled BR, 31.24 million tons of REM remain locked in the bauxite reserve. The worth of worldwide REM oxide remains unexploited in bauxite reserves and locked in stockpiled BR could be approximately $5000 billion, potentially can meet current and project demand of REM abundantly.","Swain B., Lee C.G., Park J.R.",Assessment of bauxite residue as secondary resource for rare earth metal and valorization challenges: A perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130211349&doi=10.1016%2fj.rcradv.2022.200078&partnerID=40&md5=b0ec4bd4f76cc192ab64bac9839bbd7d
International Journal of Production Research,"Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, urgent surging demand for healthcare products such as personal protective equipment (PPE) has caused significant challenges for multi-tier supply chain management. Although a given firm may predominantly focus on an arms-length solution by targeting the first-tier supplier, the firm can still struggle with extended multi-tier suppliers it cannot choose which use unsustainable practices. One key goal is compliance across various dimensions with production, environmental and labour standards across the multi-tier supply chain, a goal that blockchain technology can be applied to manage. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this research develops a system architecture of blockchain-based multi-tier sustainable supply chain management in the PPE industry designed to identify and coordinate standards in production and social and environmental sustainability in multi-tier PPE supply chains. The architecture was validated by theoretical basis, expert opinions and technical solutions.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Because the volume of food waste is increasing, actions are required to mitigate the environmental and social impact of food waste generation. This paper investigates the business models of 41 selected startups (technology and service providers) to capture how companies avoid food waste or use food waste as a resource. The case study analysis, based on secondary sources, shows that some startup business models leverage Big Data Analytics (BDA) to avoid food waste by optimizing an existing linear supply chain, while other business models create value out of food waste by leveraging a circular food supply chain. We found that the latter business models are not fully exploiting the potential of BDA. Based on our findings, we derive three propositions and one corollary. Whereas BDA seems a necessary requirement for business models that are focused on optimizing a linear supply chain, it appears optional for business models closing the supply chain loop. The propositions also discuss the timing when startups should start developing BDA capabilities depending on the business model type.","Ciccullo F., Fabbri M., Abdelkafi N., Pero M.",Exploring the potential of business models for sustainability and big data for food waste reduction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124262869&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.130673&partnerID=40&md5=553b2ac50d672ef90449c27f7c02e4c9

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Biodiversity loss driven by intensive livestock farming constitutes a major threat to the resilience of food systems. Grazing-based beef production, by contrast, supports ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Communicating these benefits to consumers is vital to stimulate demand for pasture-raised beef, with labels being a key means of conveying such credence attributes. Despite extensive research on eco-labels and sustainability certification, however, we know little about consumer perceptions of labels designed to certify and highlight the biodiversity benefits of cattle products. To address this gap, we conducted six audio-only online focus group discussions with forty buyers of beef in Germany to explore consumer perceptions of a multi-level labeling system of labeling designed to differentiate between the conservation measures applied in pasture-raised beef production. Our findings indicate significant challenges for the implementation of such labeling, including low levels of understanding of biodiversity among consumers. Most participants struggled to discriminate between different levels of biodiversity conservation measures and placed little value on the biodiversity benefits of different products. Gaining trust in certification and control procedures is problematic due to the profusion of labeling schemes on the market, especially given consumers' time pressures. However, our findings also highlight consumers' appreciation for biodiversity conservation at local level and higher levels of trust in short supply chains, suggesting opportunities for selling pasture-raised beef at local level. The differences we identify in consumers’ use of labeling can inform further segmentation research and targeted communications to market beef from grazing-based production systems.","Stampa E., Zander K.",Backing biodiversity?

Journal of Industrial Ecology,"Bioeconomy has been incorporated into the national strategy for sustainable development by many countries, and the concept of biorefinery has been considered as one of the essential components of such strategies. The environmental, economic, and social implications of a biorefinery hinge upon both the endogenous interactions among its supply chain components and their responses to the exogenous factors. The system dynamics (SD) modeling approach is suitable for understanding such complex systems. This study provides a state-of-the-art review of the methodological assumptions of existing SD studies relevant to the sustainability of biorefineries. Among the reviewed studies, common supply chain components of a biorefinery were feedstock supply, biomass conversion, market demand, distribution, and use of bioproducts. Components of a supply chain are interlinked through feedback loops. For instance, the preference for bioproduct use increases the corresponding market demand, which attracts more investment in biorefineries and changes the supply of feedstock. Exogenous variables investigated by the reviewed studies cover the market demand, population growth, GDP change, imposed regulations and incentives to evaluate endogenous factors such as the price of biomass and biofuel, change in land-use pattern, and fuel or energy choices of consumers. Through analyzing the methodological assumptions, we also identified several limitations of the models/frameworks in the existing literature, including (1) the lack of a mechanism to represent the complex interactions within the supply chain of a biorefinery with a diverse product portfolio, and (2) the lack of feedback loops incorporating the environmental (e.g., via life cycle assessment), economic (e.g., via techno-economic analysis), and social (e.g., via social life cycle assessment) influences into the interactions among supply chain components. Accordingly, we proposed a recommendation for methodology development to address these limitations.","Roy B.B., Tu Q.",A review of system dynamics modeling for the sustainability assessment of biorefineries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132640152&doi=10.1111%2fjiec.13291&partnerID=40&md5=cb5ae18273fc9e17c97f9aa9c8c9fd54
Science of the Total Environment,"Bioenergy, a means to reach a sustainable economy, is being driven by governments by devising incremental regulations and more instrumental policies in parallel. These constant-changing regulations bring uncertainty to bioenergy supply chain optimization problems. An increasing number of recent studies on bioenergy supply chain optimization addressing environmental concerns have highlighted the need for an overview indispensable. The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the incorporated policies and regulations and to examine whether constraints or targets set by governments are fully met in optimizing of bioenergy supply chains. To this end, first, bioenergy policies and regulations enacted in the EU, the global leader in the energy transition, as a benchmark are reviewed based on the bioenergy supply chain steps. Then, the optimization problems employing policies and regulations are classified and discussed. The review reveals visible gaps between what policies demand and what is proposed in the literature, and underpin the regulations which need to be considered in future work. Examination of the literature also suggests that a globally drawn standard may lead to better bioenergy supply chain development considering other green energy developments. Our key finds are • Many regulations limited to biomass supply management –CAP, GAECs, LULUCF, low ILUC-risk biofuels, and cascading principles –are overlooked. • Instrumental policies, such as FIT, FIP, TGC for electricity, Quota system for transportation, and Tariffs and subsidies for heating and cooling sector, mostly were not incorporated into the models. • Facing the variety and complexity of regulations, it seems conducive to introduce international standards for biomass supply and management.","Mina D., Hadi S., Jalal A.",The incorporated environmental policies and regulations into bioenergy supply chain management: A literature review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123214526&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.153202&partnerID=40&md5=46531afbf8a188f455dd12277a07eaff

IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,"Biomass co-firing technology for coal power plants has been widely applied in developed countries. The government of Indonesia is currently encouraging the implementation of biomass co-firing to achieve the target of 23% new and renewable energy (NRE) share in the national energy mix by 2025. Although only a few technical issues are left on the implementation of biomass co-firing in coal power plants, the challenges for the large-scale application and the long-term sustainability of the technology still need to be investigated. To identify and overcome these challenges, this paper applies the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal (PESTEL) framework to analyze the business prospects for biomass co-firing for coal power plants. There is potential for biomass co-firing in 114 units of coal power plants with a total capacity of 18.1 GW spread across various locations in Indonesia. As a consequence, it requires around 9 million tons of biomass per year. This huge potential market of biomass opens opportunities for people to participate in supplying the raw materials. The biomass market as co-firing fuels will push agricultural and industrial waste management to be used more efficiently. The biomass supply chain needs to be well developed so that the biomass supply can be sustainable at an economically feasible price, to ensure that electricity prices generated from utilities are affordable for the public. The technical specifications for biomass need to be standardized. The 10% co-firing acceleration of the total coal power plant capacity, or equivalent to around 1.81 GW, can directly contribute to the achievement of the NRE target for the electricity sector and simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The government needs to prepare related supporting instruments such as technical regulations, technological and economic aspects, and policy support.","Sugiyono A., Febijanto I., Hilmawan E., Adiarso",Potential of biomass and coal co-firing power plants in Indonesia: a PESTEL analysis,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124081260&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f963%2f1%2f012007&partnerID=40&md5=d699416d1de88a2e38e2be59268a9fae
Ore Geology Reviews,"Bismuth occurs in a wide range of mineral deposit types and is usually regarded as a deleterious by-product. Its classification as a critical raw material by the European Commission in 2017 and a critical mineral by the USA in 2018 has, however, reawakened interest in Bi production and its security of supply. Demand for Bi is increasing, mostly as a substitute for Pb and for use in chemicals. Bismuth is mainly chalcophile in behaviour, although it has some lithophile characteristics. The element is strongly concentrated in felsic crustal lithologies, particularly fractionated granites, where it can substitute for Zr in zircon. It occurs within a diverse range of minerals; the most important hydrothermal minerals are native bismuth and bismuthinite. Bismuth can substitute for Pb in galena and Bi-rich galena is a major Bi ore. Bismuth alloys with gold to form maldonite at temperatures < 373 °C, thereby acting as a Au collector in felsic melts, particularly under reduced conditions. In the weathering environment Bi is generally immobile: it forms Bi oxide or hydroxide ochres or co-precipitates with Fe. Bismuth is found in a range of mineralised systems, sometimes in sufficient quantities to be economically extracted as a by-product. The most common sources of Bi are W-, Pb-, and, occasionally, Au-rich skarns, while five element (Co-Ni-Bi-Ag-As ± U) vein deposits were historically a major source of native Bi. Bismuth also occurs in large magmatic systems such in Sn- and W-rich greisens and associated veins as native bismuth and bismuthinite. Bismuth is present in trace concentrations in porphyry-hosted Mo-W-mineralisation and in some reduced intrusion-related Au, as well as some orogenic Au, deposits. VMS deposits can host minor Bi mineralisation, typically associated with the Au-rich parts of the mineralised system. Bismuth supply is strongly reliant on Asian production; notably the skarns deposits Núi Pháo in Vietnam and Shizhuyuan in China. Alternative supplies of Bi could be unlocked by greater consideration of bismuth by-production at the evaluation stage of polymetallic prospects elsewhere, and if more sustainable recovery techniques are developed for retrieval of Bi from conventional mineral processing circuits. The knowledge base for bismuth can be improved upon through interventions at the exploration, resource and reserve reporting and mineral processing planning stages. This in turn would provide a greater understanding of the deportment of Bi-bearing minerals, impacting on the design of mineral processing flow sheets and reducing waste, and thereby improving the sustainability and environmental footprint of mineral deposits.","Deady E., Moon C., Moore K., Goodenough K.M., Shail R.K.",Bismuth: Economic geology and value chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124392034&doi=10.1016%2fj.oregeorev.2022.104722&partnerID=40&md5=602faeb90822203072d49011642409d1
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Blockchain and the internet of things (IoT) have accelerated e-commerce growth and empowered online businesses to create value even in a globally competitive environment. The goal of this study is to develop a framework for the virtual closed-loop supply chain (VCLSC) that is based on novel blockchain and IoT technologies, as well as the concepts of sustainability and circular economy. This study integrates the normal and virtual supply chains into a single framework. To maximise the total expected revenue (TER) from the VCLSC, the costs of getting raw materials and parts, transporting them with a carbon emission tax, handling, processing, and making final products, refurbishing, recycling, and virtualization are all taken into account. These include running blockchain and IoT facilities, buying RFID tags, ensuring security, and storing data in blockchain in a way that cannot be changed. The above costs are captured in a single mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. The main objective is to maximise the TER by minimising the cost of the VCLSC network. For the solution purposes, the global solver in LINGO 19 software package is used.

Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"Blockchain technology has been forwarded as an innovation to address pressing sustainability challenges in global food supply chains. However, limited studies have critically examined the technology's role in advancing sustainability. Drawing on the literature on sustainability-oriented innovation and innovation resistance theory, we explore the potential of blockchain technology to contribute to sustainable transformations within food supply chains. We reflect on 18 expert interviews with various actors across global food supply chains to evaluate the opportunities for, and resistance to, Blockchain technology as a driver of sustainability. The findings reveal that Blockchain is used within food supply chains as both a tool for sustainability as well as a broader philosophical mindset for addressing sustainability challenges. We reveal the opportunities for Blockchain technology as a sustainability-oriented innovation that can ensure fairer supply chains, enhance food traceability, and drive environmental sustainability. We also unpack the resistance to Blockchain that hinder its potential as a sustainability-oriented innovation which include functional and psychological barriers alongside cooperative barriers and protection of the status quo. Our study contributes to the broader literature on sustainability-oriented innovation and innovation resistance theory.","Friedman N., Ormiston J.",Blockchain as a sustainability-oriented innovation?: Opportunities for and resistance to Blockchain technology as a driver of sustainability in global food supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120463874&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2021.121403&partnerID=40&md5=6a40735835cfedb63d343454648c4555
Procedia Computer Science,"Blockchain technology has recently become the go-to solution for companies and industries that seek to enhance value chain traceability of their products, and transparency in their supply chains. Because of these benefits, it's been proposed for monitoring environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and compliance in industries that have weak regulatory and formal structures. The cobalt mining industry especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world's biggest producer of cobalt ore used in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, is one such environment that's characterized by conflict, and serious human rights abuses. The key actors in the cobalt supply chain, therefore, face the tradeoff involving maintaining long-term supply versus reducing the risks associated with cobalt sourced from locations with poor environmental and human rights records. Most of such problems emerge from Artisanal and small-scale mining. This paper presents an attempt to tightly link existing blockchain technology frameworks in the cobalt industry with ESG performance of companies to enable them to audit the chain of custody journeys for their components and ultimately sustainability performance. We present a responsible sourcing framework to connect blockchain source data needs to ESG metrics to help companies build interoperable but understandable blockchain architectures.","Mugurusi G., Ahishakiye E.",Blockchain technology needs for sustainable mineral supply chains: A framework for responsible sourcing of Cobalt.,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127780344&doi=10.1016%2fj.procs.2022.01.262&partnerID=40&md5=f6596fcd8ff8d64fb5bed6e8d82267ca
Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,"Blockchain technology has seen increasingly important practical applications. The literature has expanded greatly in the past four to five years. One area that has seen significant application and growth is in supply chain management—which includes transportation and logistics. The growth of this literature has also resulted in several literature reviews—each has specific scope and emphasis. Of the growing number of literature review and bibliometric analysis studies, the focus has ranged from understanding application cases, themes, trends, and methodologies. Theoretical developments and theorizing have been limited for supply chain management in general and even more limited for sustainable supply chains. Arguably, much of the current research has been relatively atheoretical—a lack of theory development and theory application. Hence, we conclude the existing blockchain research discourse has been centered around application and less around the theory. As a sub-discipline, the nexus of blockchain and supply chain management is still in the early developmental stages. Using a critical synthesis review of the literature, this paper focuses on the most popular theories that have been applied to explain blockchain adoption and implementation within supply chains—how each theory explains the motivations, formalizes the organizational process around the acceptance of blockchain technology, and predicts the outcomes of blockchain-supported business models. Current theoretical gaps and potential future theorizing are discussed. Potential theories that have been used for other technologies (i.e., the internet of things) which have not been applied to the blockchain context are provided and discussed. The comprehensive and systematic theory review has important theoretical and managerial implications for both academia by advancing multiple academic disciplines and practice with insights into actual acceptance and usage of blockchain and other disruptive technologies.","Zhu Q., Bai C., Sarkis J.",Blockchain technology and supply chains: The paradox of the atheoretical research discourse,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134586163&doi=10.1016%2fj.tre.2022.102824&partnerID=40&md5=ef9a0feefdaa6da91f76bf5be9a73048
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Blockchain technology improves the transparency and traceability of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). The merits of introducing blockchain technology are fully discussed. However, the potential sustainability risks of introducing blockchain technology to SSCM, such as excessive energy consumption and additional operating training costs, are less considered. This paper aims to ascertain and evaluate the sustainability risk factors of applying blockchain technology to SSCM. Based on the triple bottom line, the risk factors are grouped into three categories, i.e., environmental risk factors, economic risk factors, and social risk factors. This paper proposes a comprehensive risk evaluation framework for adopting blockchain to SSCM considering severity (S), occurrence (O), detection (D), and response(R) of risk factors. Then, a new risk analysis method is developed. The proposed new approach integrates the strength of Best-Worst Method (BWM) in reducing the decision makers’ burden of pairwise comparisons of risk criteria importance, and the merit of rough Combined Compromise Solution method (CoCoSo) in flexibly handling incomplete and vague information without much priori information, which makes the results of risk analysis more accurate. The results demonstrate that increased training costs, and resource waste due to repeated audits and certifications are the two most prominent risk factors. These findings give practitioners managerial insights on blockchain technology application in SSCM.","Zhang F., Song W.",Sustainability risk assessment of blockchain adoption in sustainable supply chain: An integrated method,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133157080&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2022.108378&partnerID=40&md5=eab949be22d7a23a053fae80ece2659e
Operations Management Research,"Blockchain technology, is conceptualised as a type of disruptive technology and is regarded as one of the prime tools of Industry 4.0 today. The varied features of Blockchain like smart contract, decentralisation, transparency, traceability, data immutability and data privacy along with a consensus mechanism make it suitable to be utilized in the complex and multi—echelon supply chains of today. These factors improve the production processes and make the existing supply chains agile, resilient and responsive in the long term. Blockchain also add an aspect of sustainability which correlates with the phenomenon of circular economy in today’s world. Hence firms should compare and evaluate the significance of the traditional supply chain and blockchain-enabled supply chain in bringing the concept of sustainability in the supply chain today. This paper aims to highlight the benefits of blockchain in supply chain management with the help of a literature review along with opinions of experts from the agricultural sector. The key benefits identified are data privacy, decentralisation, immutability of data, smart contract, improved sustainability, building of resilient supply chains, transparency and shared database. These potential benefits of blockchain are assessed using the analytical hierarchical process technique. Global desirability index for traditional supply chain and blockchain—enabled supply chain is calculated. The high value of global desirability index of the blockchain-enabled supply chain over the traditional supply chain suggests that the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain is justified for bringing sustainability in the supply chain. This study aims to offer meaningful implications for practitioners so that they can take suitable measures for adoption of this technology.","Mukherjee A.A., Singh R.K., Mishra R., Bag S.",Application of blockchain technology for sustainability development in agricultural supply chain: justification framework,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099848297&doi=10.1007%2fs12063-021-00180-5&partnerID=40&md5=ea485e8ba993ab0a0b1e6f1541cba12e

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Blood Supply Chain (BSC) is a challenging subset of the healthcare industry. It treats the blood flow from donor to patient guaranteeing the patient's needs. Considering the scarcity of blood products, the shortage and wastage are undesirable. As consequence, postponed surgeries, untreated patients, and even deaths should be avoided. Thus, designing and sustainably optimizing the BSC processes is vital. The paper develops a literature review focusing on translating sustainability into the BSC. It captures insights to develop a framework related to the design of a sustainable BSC under an uncertain environment. Studies from, essentially, the last 10 years are analyzed addressing the following aspects: (1) BSC phases characterization, (2) relevant models published according to the strategic-tactical and the operational-tactical perspectives, and (3) capturing the sustainability dimensions treated in previous studies — that rarely are explored together in literature. The authors filtered the initial sample of papers, achieving 90 studies that were reviewed and deeply explored. During the reviewing process, 3 papers concentrated on the strategic-tactical approach were selected as the most comprehensive on the topic — exploring each sustainable pillar. A similar approach was adopted for the operational-tactical perspective, resulting in the examination of 2 studies. The main contributions are: (1) a comprehensive literature revision connected with sustainability goals; (2) capturing insights to answer different questions — that until now have not yet been answered and (3) identifying challenges related to modeling aspects, risk, uncertainty, complexities, solution methods, and regulatory aspects. These contributions will be fruitful to develop directions to future research, adding sustainability insight directly to BSC.","Torrado A., Barbosa-Póvoa A.",Towards an Optimized and Sustainable Blood Supply Chain Network under Uncertainty: A Literature Review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131448450&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2022.100028&partnerID=40&md5=59cca0d633e8950797079f47adbf75ca
Decision Support Systems,"Blood supply chains (BSCs) play a strategic and crucial role in healthcare systems especially in unexpected situations such as earthquakes and pandemic outbreaks. Nevertheless, measuring the sustainability and resilience of BSCs is a major challenge for many decision-makers in healthcare systems. To this end, this paper presents an advanced network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) method to evaluate the sustainability and resilience of BSCs. We deal with BSCs, including blood collection centers (BCCs), blood production centers (BPCs), and blood distribution centers (BDCs). A new directional distance function (DDF) is also developed for evaluating both the overall and stage efficiency scores. Our proposed model can deal with different types of data, including integers, undesirable outputs, negative, zero, and positive. The undesirable outputs are the outputs that adversely impact the performance of DMUs. Moreover, the developed method addresses the sustainability and resilience of BSCs.

South African Journal of Industrial Engineering,"Buyers and suppliers of healthcare products and services are more dependent on each other than ever before for the provision of scarce and unique resources, which highlights the need to implement supply chain sustainability practices. Firms controlling these resources hold excessive power over others. This study adopted resource dependence theory as a theoretical lens to explore the role of relationship power in supply chain sustainability practices between a South African private healthcare provider and its suppliers. The study employed a generic qualitative single-case study design. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from 12 participants at various levels of the case organisation’s hierarchy. The main findings revealed several types of environmental and social practice used in the supply chain of the private healthcare provider. Some of the environmental practices were effective waste management and recycling, while the social practices included supplier selection and periodic reviews. The healthcare provider exercised extensive power over its suppliers to implement these practices. By exploring the advantages and disadvantages of sustainability practices, the findings showed that relationship power acted as a driver of supply chain sustainability. Mutual commitment, continuous communication, and training support these practices. Healthcare managers must be aware of the importance of relationship power for supply chain sustainability practices implementation, and are advised to invest time and effort in building buyer—supplier relationships to aid sustainability.

International Journal of Production Research,"Buying firms adopt various governance mechanisms to ensure sustainability compliance among upstream suppliers. While, certification is the most popular governance mechanism used worldwide, mounting evidence indicates that there is an incongruity in sustainability efforts between what is declared by supplier firms and their actual practices. Our empirical analysis of sustainable cocoa suppliers in Kerala (a state in South India) indicate that behavioural characteristics of suppliers, specifically their attitude towards risk and ambiguity can be used to assess suppliers’ tendency to adopt symbolic versus substantive sustainability postures. Risk aversion and ambiguity aversion were found to predict the sustainability posture of substantive (over symbolic) sustainability practices. Also, firm size and collaboration intensity played a significant role in supplier sustainability behaviour.

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","By introducing the concept of sustainable development, managers and policymakers in many industries have been encouraged to consider environmental and social issues in addition to economic objectives in their planning. Following this concept, sustainable supply chain management has become the main concern of many studies. Among all the strategies to achieve sustainability targets in a supply chain, cooperating with third-party logistics companies has attracted lots of attention. By providing more sustainable and efficient transportation services, 3PLs can help all types of regular, closed-loop, and circular SCs achieve more profit, while they are still sustainable, at least in distribution and collection/recycling stages. This study investigates the sustainable multi-channel SC design problem in the presence of the government and 3PLs. To bring the present study closer to the real-world situation, the problem is modeled using an intuitionistic fuzzy uncertainty approach. Considering the government as the leader of the SC in two centralized and decentralized decision structures, game theory has been applied to model the game between players and obtain optimal decision values. For the first time in the literature, public awareness toward green activities of the players, emission reduction, uncertainty, and delivery time have been considered in this study. The results show the presence of a 3PL will reduce the delivery time and the amount of pollution. Also, the findings confirm that governments can control the players' activities and encourage them to apply green strategies using financial tools.","Mahmoudi A., Mahmoudi R., Emrouznejad A., Hafezalkotob A.",Sustainable multi-channel supply chain design: an intuitive fuzzy game theory approach to deal with uncertain business environment,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137498753&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-022-02623-w&partnerID=40&md5=52f48ace71b7e60e0ad7733ac8163609
Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"By-product synergy (BPS) is an innovative method to convert waste into valuable by-products effectively. Based on a three-echelon supply chain composed of an upstream manufacturer, a processing plant with limited processing capacity, and a downstream manufacturer, this study derives the production quantity and waste disposal decisions of the upstream and downstream manufacturers as well as the optimal transfer price decision of the processing plant. Moreover, we assess the environmental performance of BPS. Analytical results suggest that the upstream manufacturer’s production quantity and waste disposal decisions and the processing plant’s transfer price decision are threshold dependent on the processing plant’s capacity, whereas the downstream manufacturer’s production quantity decision is threshold dependent on the processing plant’s capacity and price of raw materials. BPS is beneficial for all members of the supply chain to increase profit. The production promotion and cost-saving effects ensure that the supply chain members maximize their profit. However, BPS does not always have a positive effect on the environment; when the processing plant’s capacity and price of raw materials are below the threshold, implementing BPS results in a win-win situation of economic and environmental benefits.","Wang L., Zhang Q., Zhang M., Wang H.",Waste converting through by-product synergy: an insight from three-echelon supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114426456&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-021-16100-w&partnerID=40&md5=abc1831abdbe6c35d8ca94b984c96652

International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Carbon emission reduction has been a consensus goal for most countries to achieve environmental sustainability. The use of carbon emission trading policies has been generally considered by the governments. Remanufacturing, as an effective way to reduce carbon emission, is incorporated together with the tool of carbon emission policy to construct a low-carbon supply chain in this paper. We analyze the carbon emission reduction and profit maximization problem among enterprises of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their outsourcing remanufacturers, integrating the impact of the carbon emission constraint policy and the carbon market. Considering consumer preferences on low-carbon products and recycling rates of waste products, we construct a Stackelberg game model (dominated by the OEM) and analyze the impact of a carbon emission constraint policy on sales price, volume, carbon emission, and revenue of new and remanufactured products in the supply chain system. The results suggest that the upper bound set by the government on carbon emission for enterprises positively affects sales volume of new products and negatively affects sales prices of both products. Moreover, the discount rate of carbon emission constraint negatively affects sales volume of new products and positively affects sales prices of both products. Notably, the carbon emission constraint policy has impacts on the production decisions of both manufacturers on an economic scale. When the upper bound of carbon emission is equal to a certain threshold, the OEM could obtain the greatest revenue. The results provide a new perspective for the government to attain the goal of carbon emission reduction and not sacrifice economic growth. Managers in outsourcing remanufacturers and OEMs could also be implicated from our results to collaborate in allocating remanufacturing orders to achieve win-win opportunities between them.","Feng Y., Geng Y., Zhao G., Li M.",Carbon Emission Constraint Policy in an OEM and Outsourcing Remanufacturer Supply Chain with Consumer Preferences,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127945534&doi=10.3390%2fijerph19084653&partnerID=40&md5=f96ef99c04a2bba1020f4536ab62fc76
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Car-sharing services promise environmentally sustainable and cost-efficient alternatives to private car ownership, contributing to more environmentally sustainable mobility. However, the challenge of balancing vehicle supply and demand needs to be addressed for further improvement of the service. Currently, employees must relocate vehicles from low-demand to high-demand areas, which generates extra personnel costs, driven kilometers, and emissions. This study takes a Design Science Research (DSR) approach to develop a new way of balancing the supply and demand of vehicles in car-sharing, namely crowd-based relocation. We base our approach on crowdsourcing, a concept by which customers are requested to perform vehicle relocations. This paper reports on our comprehensive DSR project on designing and instantiating a crowd-based relocation information system (CRIS). We assessed the resulting artifact in a car-sharing simulation and conducted a real-world car-sharing service system field test. The evaluation reveals that CRIS has the potential for improving vehicle availability, increasing environmental sustainability, and reducing operational costs. Further, the prescriptive knowledge derived in our DSR project can be used as a starting point to improve individual parts of the CRIS and to extend its application beyond car-sharing into other sharing services, such as power bank-or e-scooter-sharing.","Brendel A.B., Lichtenberg S., Morana S., Prinz C., Hillmann B.M.",Designing a Crowd-Based Relocation System—The Case of Car-Sharing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132692669&doi=10.3390%2fsu14127090&partnerID=40&md5=98f903a1e1eaf7bfb8124e07a4fb6851
Agriculture (Switzerland),"Castor is a candidate crop that grows in marginal lands in the Mediterranean area. It can be grown by utilizing minimal resources to provide unique industrial chemicals or to serve as an energy crop. However, it can be also cultivated with intensive inputs providing higher yields. Whether a high input or a low input scheme is more sustainable depends on the economic and environmental impacts of each case. The objective of the present study, therefore, was to evaluate these impacts under the Mediterranean climate and farming conditions by examining two alternative scenarios: a castor crop grown on a low-inputs field vs. a crop grown in a high-inputs one. The environmental impacts were estimated by following a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology based on GHG emissions. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed by switching the functional unit from 1 Mg of castor oil to 1 hectare. The economic feasibility of the castor crop production was assessed by calculating the gross margin, which is referred to the difference between revenues and the variable costs due to the agricultural phases. In addition, the ratio between gross margin and GWP (Global Warming Potential) emissions was applied to calculate the economic performance (gross margin) per unit of environmental burden. Findings showed that the castor oil produced by high inputs resulted in a more sustainable scenario due to its higher yield than low-inputs ones. On the other hand, sensitivity analysis showed that the field management with low inputs showed GHG emissions that were 27% lower than those emitted from the field management with high in-puts. Moreover, from an economic point of view, by switching the field management from low inputs to high ones, the Gross Margin increased by about 73%. Finally, the high-inputs scenario showed the best ratio between economic performance and GHG emitted into the atmosphere.","Pari L., Alexopoulou E., Stefanoni W., Latterini F., Cavalaris C., Palmieri N.",The Eco-Efficiency of Castor Supply Chain: A Greek Case Study,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124158333&doi=10.3390%2fagriculture12020206&partnerID=40&md5=422ff58a6c3f923bcb1394eac4ce677d
International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications,"Cause marketing (CM) has become a prevalent form of generating support for a cause while netting valuable visibility for both the firm and the environmental nonprofit organisation. In this paper, to better help the government encourage CM campaigns, we adopt a stylised game-theoretical model to explore the strategic role of CM in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) for an offline-online dual-channel system. We show that the offline retailer’s incentives for CM can be weakened by online drop-shipping, and that the manufacturer prefers online drop-shipping rather than batch ordering if the degree of consumer mistrust for CM is sufficiently low. One other counter intuitive finding is that offline CM may be harmful to sustainability when the online channel is dominant. This result suggests that the government should carefully regulate CM in such supply chain systems.","Wu J., Lu W., Ji X.",Strategic role of cause marketing in sustainable supply chain management for dual-channel systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097390697&doi=10.1080%2f13675567.2020.1854206&partnerID=40&md5=074a3f28ef55bef52d8ea8e2489e9166
Energy,"China has experienced rapid urbanization across the country which has required significant energy use and has also posed a series of possible environmental risks. Given the role that the construction industry plays in China's economy and in achieving sustainability, it is paramount to trace and measure the evolutionary pathways of energy induced by China's supply chains. By using a multiregional input–output model, structural path analysis, and exploratory spatial data analysis, this study presents a spatiotemporal analysis of how upstream energy interactions change in the context of rapid urbanization and the Chinese economy. The results show there has been less embodied energy consumption of building materials over time due to significant improvements in energy intensity reduction. The upstream energy distribution exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity within clustered urban agglomerations. Regions with poor resource endowment but highly vibrant economies appear to have wider connections with the national economy, whilst the critical energy flows in resource-exporting regions were only concentrated in energy-intensive sectors. The findings of this study provide improved understanding of energy evolutionary pathways and their complexities from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Such understanding will assist policymakers, especially the local government of each province, to implement effective energy reduction strategies and fairly address the allocation of energy reduction responsibilities.","Jingke H., Chenyu W., Chang-Richards A., Jingxiao Z., Qiping G.S., Bei Q.",A spatiotemporal analysis of energy use pathways in the construction industry: A study of China,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116928984&doi=10.1016%2fj.energy.2021.122084&partnerID=40&md5=a0e1c1d38c85ba5ef4cfd76cf4bfad6a

Axioms,"Choosing the most suitable cold chain logistics service providers (CLPs) is a vital strategic decision for businesses aiming to achieve an effective and sustainable cold supply chain. A sustainable CLP is one that integrates sustainable practices across its whole operation cycle to achieve product quality, on-time deliveries, and satisfied customer requirements, while preventing products from going to waste, which is especially important in the context of a developing country. This study aims to evaluate and select the best CLP regarding their sustainability performance. For this evaluation, a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)-based framework is proposed that integrates the grey analytic hierarchy process (G-AHP) and grey complex proportional assessment (G-COPRAS) methodologies, in which grey numbers are used to express the linguistic evaluation statements of experts. Initially, the evaluation criteria based on service level, economic, environmental, and social dimensions were determined by means of a literature review and experts’ opinions to employ the MCDM approach. The G-AHP was utilized to identify the criteria weights, and then, G-COPRAS was used to select the best CLP among the alternatives. A case illustration in Vietnam is presented to exhibit the presented approach’s applicability. From the G-AHP findings, product quality, logistics costs, innovation, and effectiveness of cold chain processes, customer experience, and CO emissions of refrigerated vehicle were ranked as the five most important criteria. From the G-COPRAS analysis, Yoshida Saigon Cold Logistic (CPL-05) is the best CLP. The robustness of the applied integrated MCDM approach was also tested by conducting a comparative analysis, in which the priority rankings of the best CLPs were very similar. The assessment in this study is directed towards enabling managers, practitioners, and stakeholders of cold chain businesses to assess the most efficient CLP in the supply chain in the market and also to devise suitable strategies toward sustainable development.","Nguyen N.-A.-T., Wang C.-N., Dang L.-T.-H., Dang L.-T.-T., Dang T.-T.",Selection of Cold Chain Logistics Service Providers Based on a Grey AHP and Grey COPRAS Framework: A Case Study in Vietnam,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127978227&doi=10.3390%2faxioms11040154&partnerID=40&md5=400c14eb44e067fb44b34dfd8eaf480d

It uses content analysis of semi-structured interviews to elucidate what CE practices and material flow are in operation in the supply chain. While financial considerations are the main factor driving CE adoption, transactions can also function as an indirect driver to CE adoption via assurance/certification schemes requirements that also reduce overall uncertainty.

Science of the Total Environment,"Circular economy (CE) is claimed to be a promising pathway to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but a reliable metric is needed to validate closed-loop strategies by measuring sustainability performances together with the degree of circularity. A significant contribution is offered by Life Cycle (LC) scholars in terms of methodological advances and operational tools for different sectors, also those more complex such as the agro-industrial systems that encompass biological and anthropogenic variables at different scales. However, to date, LC methodologies have not yet answered how to model the complexity of circular pathways. LC evaluations are often modelled for cradle-to-grave analyses, while a circularity evaluation would require an extension of the system boundaries to more interconnected life cycles, orienting towards a cradle-to-cradle perspective. This research gap led us to propose a multi-cycle approach with expanded assessment boundaries, including co-products, into a cradle-to-cradle perspective, in an attempt to internalize circularity impacts. The customized LC framework here proposed is based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the Environmental Life Cycle Costing (ELCC) in terms of internal and external costs, and the Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) in terms of Psychosocial Risk Factor (PRF) impact pathway. The model is designed to be applied to the olive-oil sector, which commonly causes significant impacts by generating many by-products whose management is often problematic. Results are expected to show that the customized LC framework proposed can better highlight the environmental and socioeconomic performances of the system of cycles, allowing CE to deliver its promises of sustainability, as the circularity of materials per se is a means, not an end in itself.","Stillitano T., Falcone G., Iofrida N., Spada E., Gulisano G., De Luca A.I.",A customized multi-cycle model for measuring the sustainability of circular pathways in agri-food supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133765732&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.157229&partnerID=40&md5=af2643377e2079f47ff351f9278bf421
Operations Management Research,"Circular economy (CE) paradigm fosters manufacturing companies’ sustainability taking place through different circular manufacturing (CM) strategies. These strategies allow companies to be internally committed to embrace circular values and to be externally aligned with several stakeholders not necessarily belonging to the same supply chain. Nevertheless, these CM strategies adoption is limited by heterogeneous barriers, among which the management and sharing of data and information remain the most relevant ones, bounding the decision-making process of manufacturers in CM. Moreover, the extant literature unveiled the need to structure data and information in a reference model to make them usable by manufacturers. Therefore, the goal of the present work is to propose a reference model by developing a conceptual data model to standardise and structure the necessary data in CM to support manufacturers’ decision-making process. Through this model, data and information to be gathered by manufacturers are elucidated, providing an overview of which ones should be managed internally, and shared externally, clarifying the presence of their mutual interdependencies.

Our study aims to enrich the research in this field by identifying barriers and enablers to the implementation of a variety of CBMs in the electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) sector. Based on this analysis, we provide several policy insights. The EEE sector has been chosen as the focus of this study as a sector with large untapped potential in implementing circularity practices. The study adopts a multi-case study approach and uses a sample of 31 cases developed through the CIRC4Life EU-funded project and the snowball sampling method. To our knowledge, this represents the largest case study sample used to examine CE approaches in the EEE sector. Our findings show that despite the various policy instruments in place to boost the CE transition in this sector, there exist gaps which require policy attention. These include lack of rules for transparency across supply chains, weak enforcement of EU waste legislation rules, limited use of circularity criteria in public tenders and lack of CE standards. Inconsistent requirements stemming from different policy domains can also pose challenges for companies adopting CE practices.

IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,"Circular economy has attracted great attention as it meets environmental and social requirements. Selecting appropriate suppliers considering circular, and sustainability aspects for all industries is of great significance.

This article aims to address the SCSS problem considering the impacts of possible future events via a multiple-criteria decision-making framework. For this purpose, stratification theory is utilized to develop and practice a novel framework called stratified fuzzy full consistency method to identify the optimal weight coefficients of criteria considering the possible impacts of future events. Later, a novel extension of mixed aggregation by comprehensive normalization technique under fuzzy environment is developed to prioritize suppliers with respect to sustainability and circular economy criteria.

International Journal of Production Economics,"Circular Economy promises to achieve sustainability by decoupling economic growth from resource extraction and environmental losses. However, it requires a systemic change in the design of products, business models and supply chains. In this study the evolution of the supply chain structure and relationships is addressed in the specific context of industrial districts – i.e., agglomerations of small and medium-sized firms territorially concentrated and specialised in one or more phases of a production process – undergoing a transition to Circular Economy. Through the study of the textile industrial district in Prato (Italy), this study addresses two topics that have been limitedly investigated in the literature. First, the potential role of Circular Economy in revitalising an industrial district in a decline phase. Second, how supply chain structure and relationships should evolve in an industrial district transitioning to Circular Economy. This study outlines the causes triggering industrial districts decline and discusses the factors that can induce a Circular Economy based re-organisation of industrial districts. Consequently, we provide insight to managers on how to successfully couple Circular Economy and technological or business model innovations with supply chain management practices. We also provide indications to policymakers on how local and regional actors can support a Circular Economy driven reorganisation of industrial districts.

"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Cities influence land use change on neighboring and distal areas through sociopolitical or infrastructural connections between urban and non-urban regions, termed teleconnections. While teleconnections are generally recognized as important to land cover dynamics, many land use and land cover change (LULCC) modeling efforts do not explicitly account for non-contiguous spatial urban-land relationships. Here, we quantify and map urban land teleconnections in the US using information theory in concert with graphical networks. Evidence of teleconnections relied on long-term (1950–2016) changes in urban land cover and urban population intensity in urban areas (census defined “urban area”) relative to land dynamics in other cities and rural lands (rural portions of counties), located both proximate and distal to each city. While there are numerous definitions of rural and urban (see Richter, 2021 for review), we rely on national census definitions in this study for replicability. We find that optimal urban-rural land network complexity and network size ranged dramatically and depended on the information theory measure and variables under consideration. City-city networks were very large, suggesting the complex and simultaneous effects of globalization on cities. However, we also find that proximate urban-rural networks are small and influenced directly by individual cities, though each city may, in turn, be influenced by complex teleconnections with other cities. Distal rural areas providing agricultural commodities were characterized by decreasing agriculture land use yet increasing agricultural production intensity. Hence, distal rural commodity areas may support multiple cities, incurring increased land stress in those areas. Our results suggest that changes in population intensity, rather than urban land cover alone, induce more numerous effects on proximate and distal rural lands, as well as other cities. Predictive models of teleconnection strength explained 4.5% to 98% of variation in teleconnection measures and suggested that rural land characteristics were equally, if not more, important than variables characterizing city land dynamics. This indicates that local dynamics in rural areas are potentially more important drivers of land change relative to teleconnections with cities. Ultimately, the methodological approach presented in this paper holds promise in incorporating teleconnections in LULCC modeling efforts, providing important considerations for later studies on emissions modeling, economic supply chains and future land-use planning.","McManamay R.A., Brinkley C., Vernon C.R., Raj S., Rice J.S.",Urban land teleconnections in the United States: A graphical network approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129759720&doi=10.1016%2fj.compenvurbsys.2022.101822&partnerID=40&md5=a3fa7fa0bb6281ce335aa6b094526f0b
European Journal of Risk Regulation,"Climate change and the pursuit of sustainability and sustainable business might be regarded as among the world's ""wicked problems"", especially as they are multi-dimensional problems. Achieving corporate accountability in this context is also difficult when corporate structures are complex as they operate globally and through supply chains.

This paper will argue that these legislative and regulatory efforts are to be welcomed, but the complexity of the regulation threatens to undermine its potential impact. It may therefore be necessary to reduce some of the complexity of the regulatory arrangements.

Extractive Industries and Society,"Climate change can affect the mining sector in various ways. Physical impacts can be a threat to mines and personnel, transport infrastructure and supply chains, while the low-carbon transition may entail transition risks stemming from e.g., the need to respond to mitigation and adaptation policies, as well as opportunities in the form of increased metal and mineral demand. However, there is little knowledge of how mining companies perceive, manage, and respond to risks related to climate change. To address this knowledge gap, we examined annual and sustainability reports from 2019 for active metal mines in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Through a structuring qualitative content analysis, we analysed the mining companies’ self-reported experience of and expectations for climate change impacts and risks, as well as adaptation and management activities taken or planned. Our findings indicate that physical impacts of climate change are not perceived as a major risk. In contrast, mitigation activities and reactions to climate policies play an important role, at least for some of the companies.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions is the most important issue in the world, threatening our lives. Studies reveal that most emissions are caused by transportation (29%), manufacturing (23%), and irregular population distribution across the world. This study suggests the localization of recycling and manufacturing plastic parts and components by additive manufacturing. Localization will decrease transportation, resulting in reduced energy consumption and CO2 emissions. However, the method may not be sufficient because local additive manufacturing means less reliance on supply chains and higher dependence on the workforce in rural areas. Factors such as the workforce in rural areas, multientity authorities, and policy are important to the realization of sustainable manufacturing. In this study, a novel strategic control model is proposed to focus on human-centric approaches. The strategic control model proposes methods to connect strategic planning with demography and the workforce and to apply control metrics to relocate overcrowded populations to rural areas. The strategic control model realizes localization through workforce allocation and home-based manufacturing. It streamlines the integration between recycling, manufacturing, and distribution. As a result, decreased reliance on the supply chain reduces transportation, energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and cost. It also creates job opportunities and mitigates societal issues.","Wu H., Mehrabi H., Naveed N., Karagiannidis P.",Impact of strategic control and supply chain management on recycled plastic additive manufacturing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133213430&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.132511&partnerID=40&md5=8c4a8c8ef171a36e83c013486259d707

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Climate change is everywhere, and the Arctic is no exception. The melting sea ice has caused renewed interest in expanding maritime shipping for potentially more accessible ocean routes. Canada emerges as a natural land bridge for trade between Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Plausibly, it is not a choice but an imperative to properly integrate the stakeholders (the environment, countries, remote communities, industrial partners) in opening the Arctic Circle to the global economy while considering the challenges. Keeping sustainability front and center and drawing on the extant literature and government policies, this interdisciplinary study offers a Canadian perspective on Arctic transportation routes over tribal lands and their quadruple bottom line (QBL) impacts on the environment, economy, society, and Indigenous cultures. Unlike the arguable premise that new transport corridors will increase trade traffic and enhance the economy in Northern Canada, the QBL approach enables a more holistic and realistic strategy for the Arctic region’s sustainable development regarding regional economies, rural logistics, supply chain efficiency, and social licensing. Drawing on an integrative literature review as methodology, we highlight the QBL framework and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as crucial policy tools. Such a holistic perspective helps stakeholders and decision makers frame better policies in identifying, assessing, adapting, and mitigating risks for transportation infrastructure exposed to climate change. We recap the impacts of Arctic Shipping (ArSh) on QBL pillars in an interaction matrix and emphasize that while ArSh may be complementary to economic development, it poses threats to the viability of the Indigenous cultures.","Tiller S.J., Rhindress A.P., Oguntola I.O., Ülkü M.A., Williams K.A., Sundararajan B.",Exploring the Impact of Climate Change on Arctic Shipping through the Lenses of Quadruple Bottom Line and Sustainable Development Goals,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124907285&doi=10.3390%2fsu14042193&partnerID=40&md5=20e2f9b370784090b1b99c7c001c25f5
Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery,"Climate change, global warming, and the negative consequences of fossil fuels on human life and the environment have prompted governments to seek a long-term replacement for fossil fuels, such as biofuel. According to a few considerations of sustainable supplier selection in the area of constructing biofuel supply chains, import and export activities, financial decisions, and all aspects of sustainability at the same time, this research creates a novel multi-objective model for designing a biofuel supply chain by incorporating financial decisions, sustainability, international suppliers and markets. Supplier selection criteria are weighted using the fuzzy best-worst method, and suppliers are ranked using fuzzy TOPSIS. A possibilistic programming approach based on the Me fuzzy measure is utilized to deal with parameter uncertainties. A fuzzy programming approach is implemented to solve the model. To demonstrate the applicability of the suggested model, an actual case study in Iran is used. The numerical results show that biofuel production and transportation operations account for the bulk of overall costs. Greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of water required contribute significantly to the environmental goal. When compared to deterministic models, profit and social objectives are lower in uncertain models, while order allocation and environmental objectives are higher, but the system will hedge against the high level of uncertainty. In conclusion, the suggested model has a notable impact on improving sustainable facets and can be implemented by governments and legislators.","Zarrinpoor N., Khani A.","A biofuel supply chain design considering sustainability, uncertainty, and international suppliers and markets",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134310377&doi=10.1007%2fs13399-022-02804-7&partnerID=40&md5=d867f5c54156c6b882de492cf2161fea
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) are essential for maximising the value creation over the entire life cycle of a product. The design of these networks is increasing due to growing online businesses and rising sustainability awareness. This study develops a multi-objective optimisation model for sustainable CLSC network problem considering supply chain's inherent complexity (multi-echelon, multi-product, multi-mode and multi-period nature) along with price-sensitive demand, consumer's incentives and different quality levels of product. The proposed model seeks to optimise total cost and carbon emissions generated by production, distribution, transportation, and disposal activities. A two-stage algorithm, through the integration of the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Co-Kriging approach is utilised to determine the trade-off between costs and carbon emissions in the CLSC network. Data collected from a leading European household appliance company was used to analyse and interpret the developed model. The results show that the proposed two-stage approach provides robust outcomes and is computationally less expensive than the epsilon constraint approach. The study evidences the positive effects of incentive pricing on returned goods in the reverse logistics network and provides multiple trade-off solutions for supply chain managers to make informed decisions.","Mogale D.G., De A., Ghadge A., Aktas E.",Multi-objective modelling of sustainable closed-loop supply chain network with price-sensitive demand and consumer's incentives,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127297054&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2022.108105&partnerID=40&md5=805107e3160de1edbf29e4a5495e4792
Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,"Closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) have attracted more attention due to its sustainability. However, few studies considered the capital constraints problem of the dual-channel CLSCs. We investigate the manufacturer's financing strategies in a dual-channel CLSC consisting of a capital-constrained manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer can adopt four financial strategies: bank credit financing (BCF) strategy, retailer credit financing (RCF) strategy, and two mixed financing (MF) strategies (i.e., MF strategy of bank credit and equity financing (MF-BE), and MF strategy of retailer credit and equity financing (MF-RE)), respectively. We find that, when the retailer's interest rate is equal to the bank's interest rate, the manufacturer prefers to borrow money from the bank, and the MF-BE strategy is the optimal financing strategy for the manufacturer if the equity financing ratio satisfies certain condition. Interestingly, we also find that the retailer's profits under the MF-RE strategy decrease with the equity financing ratio while the retailer's profits under MF-BE strategy increase with the equity financing ratio.","Ma P., Meng Y.",Optimal financing strategies of a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126896743&doi=10.1016%2fj.elerap.2022.101140&partnerID=40&md5=0be540692a700175da787a447daa15d3
Global Environmental Change,"Cobalt is an important critical material and a constituent of a broad range of products such as batteries, electronics, superalloys, and hard metals. Effective recycling of cobalt is considered one of the most pivotal processes in alleviating its criticality. In this paper, using the dynamic modelling of material, energy, and water flows in cobalt supply chain, we show that by 2050 around 25% of the total demand for cobalt could be supplied by recycling. Our results indicate that, compared to the primary production of cobalt, its recycling might lead to a reduction of energy consumption by 46% associated with the global cobalt supply chain and the corresponding fall in the use of water by 40%. In addition, recycling of cobalt is estimated to mitigate around 59% of the total emissions of greenhouse gases and 98% of the total emissions of sulfur oxides. Finally, we present the regionally distributed projections of cobalt-related energy and water use from 2020 to 2050.","Rahimpour Golroudbary S., Farfan J., Lohrmann A., Kraslawski A.",Environmental benefits of circular economy approach to use of cobalt,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134560326&doi=10.1016%2fj.gloenvcha.2022.102568&partnerID=40&md5=04c4df52a67a89d5e0af3c3dbe2a183e
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Cold chain management has gained increasing interest among practitioners, researchers and academics; similarly, sustainability is also proving to be an increasingly critical topic in all supply chains and in cold chains in particular. In line with this, this study proposes a model to estimate the economic and environmental impacts in a food cold supply chain (FCSC). The model intended to estimate the total cost and CO2 emissions of a company operating in the cold supply chain, was carried out in Microsoft Excel™. Specifically, the model reproduces the main FCSC processes, i.e., Product collection, Backroom storage, Product delivery and Reverse logistics. For each process, we have exposed the implemented equations. Results show that the product delivery process is the most critical in both economic and environmental terms. Conversely, product collection and reverse logistics process contribute to the total cost and emission to a limited extent.

Environmental and Climate Technologies,"Cold supply chains of food and beverage sectors represent one of the main drivers of the EU total final energy consumption. Within this context, food quality losses, changes in temperature regimes, energy use, environmental burdens, and the economic viability of energy efficiency measures are essential aspects to consider for improving cold supply chains' overall sustainability. This paper presents a dedicated toolbox, developed within the Horizon 2020 project ICCEE, for supporting decision-making and actors to assess energy efficiency path within a specific type of food cold-supply (i.e., meat, fish, milk and cheese products, fruits, and vegetables). More in specific the toolbox offers support for decision-makers to understand and minimize the specific energy consumption, to decrease the overall environmental impact even including non-energy benefit evaluation many times underestimated. The six separated tools merged within a unique toolbox consider different methodological approaches such as: assessment of the whole energy requirements in stock and flows considering the storage impact, the logistics and quality losses over time, implementation of Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle costs within the environmental and financial assessment of energy efficiency measures, based on a benchmarking approach. Finally, a specific approach implementing Multi Criteria Analysis was developed on selected key performance indicators such as specific and cumulated energy consumptions, quality losses and environmental burdens (i.e., global warming potential and water scarcity).

Environmental Quality Management,"Companies are often seen as villains since their main purpose is to generate shareholder value. A deeper view of organizations, however, reveals that companies have a more comprehensive role than just achieving economic returns. Based on this premise, this study aims to analyze the financing of supply chains of B corporations; we employ the perspective of agency theory in the context of the “new emerging normal.” A multiple case study of companies belonging to the B corporations’ ranking in the Brazilian scenario was prepared. In-depth interviews were conducted with key informants from the investigated companies. The results show that the cost of obtaining certification is borne by the companies’ own resources, which are motivated by pressure from the environmental demands. The main conclusion of the study is that B Corporations, driven by economic perspectives, tend to assume the role of drivers of supply chain development.

Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Review,"Concerns about climate change call for a careful assessment of the environmental impact of the supply chain of critical materials such as magnesium (Mg) which has a broad range of applications. Enhancing the circularity of this material is vital for ensuring its sustainable use. However, systematic analysis of the sustainability of the global production of magnesium and its circularity is still missing. We propose a novel dynamic model based on geology and processing routes to quantify the key environmental concerns across the life cycle of primary and secondary magnesium. Energy consumption, water use and related emissions are assessed for recycling including functional (recovered Mg reused in the closed-loop supply chain) and nonfunctional (recovered Mg as an element used in aluminum alloys as open-loop supply chain), as well as casting and molding. Results show a significant potential contribution of circularity of magnesium to energy (up to 31 billion GJ) and water (up to 2.7 Km3) savings, as well as the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (up to 3 billion tonnes CO2 eq), globally. However, the analysis indicates that 87% of secondary magnesium comes from nonfunctional recycling. The result shows the possible increase of nonfunctional recycling of magnesium from 612 kt in 2020 to 1 mt in 2050, and the growth of functional recycling of magnesium from 96 kt in 2020 to 161 kt in 2050.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Concerns about social sustainability issues such as child labour, inequality, excessive overtime, and abusive working and living conditions in developing countries' manufacturing sectors have prompted an urgent study on sustainable social supply chain practices. The social pillar of sustainability has then been unnoticed, favouring the more regularly discussed environmental and economic dimensions. This study aims to expand the social sustainability framework to investigate the impact of sustainable social supply chain practices on firm social performance. The electronic survey was conducted on firms that adopted sustainable social practices. The 144 data sets were received from manufacturing firms. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling with PLS-SEM to examine domains and outcomes of sustainable supply chain practices. The result found that social supply chain practices impact the firm's social performance. However, the results indicate that the social element of sustainable procurement does not affect the firm social performance. The results show social fairness challenged manufacturing firms to comply with sustainable production and distribution. Most manufacturing firms are still not aware of their role and social responsibility to develop the local suppliers and community.

Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,"Concerns regarding the environment and society have inspired several studies on sustainable supply chain management. These studies typically consider that enterprises are motivated by incentives such as subsidies. Consequently, these studies have developed various optimization models based on the positive aspects of such incentives. However, many social science studies argue that subsidies are not always effective. Here, to clarify the relationships between sustainable supply chains and subsidies, we developed mixed-integer linear programming models, considering various subsidy programs, for sustainable supply chain design. The solutions of our numerical experiments on these models provided important managerial insights.

Energies,"Considering increasingly ambitious pledges by countries and various forms of pressure from current international constellations, society, investors, and clients further up the supply chain, the question for companies is not so much whether to take decarbonisation action, but what action and by when. However, determining an ideal mix of measures to apply ‘decarbonisation efficiency’ requires more than knowledge of technically feasible measures and how to combine them to achieve the most economic outcome: In this paper, working in a ‘backcasting’ manner, the author describes seven aspects which heavily influence the composition of an ‘ideal mix’ that executive leadership needs to take a (strategic) position on. Contrary to previous studies, these aspects consider underlying motivations and span across (socio-)economic, technical, regulatory, strategic, corporate culture, and environmental factors and further underline the necessity of clarity of definitions. How these decisions influence the determination of the decarbonisation-efficient ideal mix of measures is further explored by providing concrete examples.

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Considering supply chain efficiency during the network design process significantly affect chain performance improvement. In this paper, the design process of a sustainable lead-acid battery supply chain network was addressed. Because the design of such networks always involves great computational complexity, in the present study, a two-stage model was proposed to overcome this issue. In the first stage, candidate sites of recycling centers were identified using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and based on their efficiency scores. Unlike the previous studies, not only economic criteria but also technical and geographical criteria were employed to select these locations. In the second stage, a bi-objective programming model was developed to simultaneously determine the tactical and strategic decisions of the chain. Since some data was subject to uncertainty, a robust possibilistic approach was presented. The model ensures that the resulting structure for the chain will be robust to noise and disturbance in parameters. A life cycle assessment model based on the ReCiPe 2008 method was developed in SimaPro software. To evaluate the applicability of the presented method, a case study in the automotive industry was used. The results of implementing the DEA method showed that from among 23 available locations, 11 potential places were selected for construct recycling centers. The final results showed that the inappropriate potential locations of recycling centers were eliminated, and the complexity of the mathematical model proposed in the second stage was reduced. The obtained results of environmental protection costs revealed that this criterion changed from 0 to 8,333,874,332. Moreover, the first objective function resulted in a centralized network to minimize costs, and in contrast, the second objective function tended to decentralize the network to minimize environmental impacts.","Ghalandari M., Amirkhan M., Amoozad-Khalili H.",A hybrid model for robust design of sustainable closed-loop supply chain in lead-acid battery industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135200419&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-022-21840-4&partnerID=40&md5=6e9980aa1cc051ec93411c2350f13c7c

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Construction 4.0 has become a buzzword since the penetration of building information modeling (BIM), cyber-physical systems, and digital and computing technologies into the construction industry. Among emerging technologies, distributed ledger technology (DLT), or blockchain, is a powerful business enhancer whose potential can disrupt projects, AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) firms, and construction supply chain, and in a broader sense, the whole construction industry. This technology has not reached the plateau of productivity due to several barriers and challenges. Previous studies have started to investigate the barriers to implementing DLT in various sectors and segmentations. However, we still need further surveys in the construction industry. This study evaluates the applicability of identified challenges and barriers based on a sustainability perspective. Precisely, we will answer which challenges need to be addressed for the sustainability of the construction industry.

Buildings,"Construction is a resource-intensive industry where a circular economy (CE) is essential to minimize global impacts and conserve natural resources. A CE achieves long-term sustainability by enabling materials to circulate along the critical supply chains. Accordingly, recent research has proposed a paradigm shift towards CE-based sustainability. However, uncertainties caused by fluctuating raw material prices, scarce materials, increasing demand, consumers’ expectations, lack of proper waste infrastructure, and the use of wrong recycling technologies all lead to complexities in the construction industry (CI). This research paper aims to determine the enablers of a CE for sustainable development in the CI. The system dynamics (SD) approach is utilized for modeling and simulation purposes to address the associated process complexity. First, using content analysis of pertinent literature, ten enablers of a CE for sustainable development in CI were identified. Then, causality among these enablers was identified via interviews and questionnaire surveys, leading to the development of the causal loop diagram (CLD) using systems thinking. The CLD for the 10 shortlisted enablers shows five reinforcing loops and one balancing loop. Furthermore, the CLD was used to develop an SD model with two stocks: “Organizational Incentive Schemes” and “Policy Support.” An additional stock (“Sustainable Development”) was created to determine the combined effect of all stocks.

Processes,"Consumer demand for organic products, rapidly growing urbanizations levels requires the food supply chain to reduce lead-time and maintain higher product quality. For the food supply chain to cope with the raising issues an e-commerce type of supply chain must be implemented. This approach creates challenges for supply chain, because the food industry must shift towards high variety and low quantity freight forwarding with multiple delivery points. The methodology of the paper consists of scientific literature analysis and macro indicator clustering. The author of the paper proposes a supply chain management framework, which is grounded through complexity theory. The framework mainly consists of 3 characteristics, which organizations should operationalize to maintain system resilience and which in the long-run would evolve to sustainable development–capabilities, collaboration, complexity management. The proposed framework defines how operational and tactical levels should be automated through cyber-physical systems, while the automation should be controlled through strategic level variables. The macro level analysis of existing EU markets of the food industry has been conducted to identify the food industry’s contingencies, in which an agent-based model will be used to validate the proposed framework. Main 3 clusters were identified, which number was chosen based on the elbow method and validated with the silhouette score of 0.749. The food industry can be categorized in to developing, underdeveloped, and developed food industries. Moreover, singularities of different contingencies have been identified which considers population size, population density, market size of the food industry and disruption intensity. The application of the framework depends on the identified contingencies. From strategic level the SCMF is similar in all contingencies, however, depending on the type of market, more emphasize on vehicle routing or demand forecasting should be made.","Gružauskas V., Burinskienė A.",Managing Supply Chain Complexity and Sustainability: The Case of the Food Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129610678&doi=10.3390%2fpr10050852&partnerID=40&md5=b0d350140d8d5d7893727e9e8915406b
"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Consumer electronics contain a broad spectrum of materials whose production requires water and potentially discharges contaminants into the water supply, exacerbating freshwater scarcity and pollution. These water impacts have not yet been fully studied, as much of the literature on consumer electronics focuses on supply chain energy or carbon footprint. This study evaluates life cycle water consumption and degradation impacts associated with extracting and producing base, precious, hazardous, and critical metals that are typically found in electronic products. Water impacts were analyzed for individual metals and for the representative material profile of smartphones and laptop computers to identify “hotspots” for future improvement. Results indicate that, at the level of individual materials, precious metals have the highest impacts, due to water consumed directly for mining operations and indirectly for energy production, and water degradation attributed to metal emissions during mine tailings management. At the product level, precious metals also have the highest contribution per smartphone, whereas aluminum has a higher contribution per laptop, accounting for about 40% of the total water scarcity footprint. On the other hand, for water quality impacts, precious metals are responsible for the highest contributions for both products. Scenarios are evaluated to assess improvement potential associated with product design changes, including alternate supply chains, material substitution, and use of recycled content. The greatest potential opportunities for reducing water impacts were sourcing metals from lower water scarcity regions (19% reduction over the baseline water scarcity footprint) and increasing recycled content to the maximum theoretical potential (20% reduction).","Madaka H., Babbitt C.W., Ryen E.G.",Opportunities for reducing the supply chain water footprint of metals used in consumer electronics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116008700&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2021.105926&partnerID=40&md5=8796023413f13b1883c912c3466a6369
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Consumers increasingly prefer more direct and more transparent food distribution channels, such as short food supply chains (SFSCs). Nonetheless, SFSCs face a variety of issues and challenges in their creation and functioning, resulting in limited performance and sustainability, as well as in difficulties of upscaling. This study aims at improving our understanding of SFSCs’ issues/challenges through a systematic review of the most recent literature. We perform a full-text content analysis of 44 studies, looking for answers to the research questions: At which parts of the SFSCs do the issues/challenges occur? How can we characterize the issues/challenges in SFSCs? While doing so, we offer a holistic perspective on SFSCs. We make use of the SCOR model to define SFSC processes as well as to describe the nature of these issues/challenges. The findings of this study shed light on the nature and strategic-tactical-operational level of the issues/challenges in SFSCs and point out the limitations in the existing literature such as the SFSC processes that are neglected. The holistic approach we suggest and the insight on SFSCs’ issues/challenges we provide can help researchers offer effective solutions and strategies to support the overall development of SFSCs.","Bayir B., Charles A., Sekhari A., Ouzrout Y.",Issues and Challenges in Short Food Supply Chains: A Systematic Literature Review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126270856&doi=10.3390%2fsu14053029&partnerID=40&md5=9c47be992f14065998e30535140f8292
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Consumers play a crucial role in reducing the burden on the environment through their food choices. Currently, food choices are mainly determined by price, convenience, taste and health. To change eating patterns to more sustainable eating patterns, it is essential to understand how consumers interpret “sustainability” in relation to the food supply chain. The aim of this systematic review is to categorize and to describe consumer perceptions of food-related environmental sustainability in general. We conducted a systematic literature review of quantitative and qualitative studies published between January 2010 and June 2020. This resulted in 76 articles; 49 quantitative, 21 qualitative and 6 mixed-method studies. Open coding (grounded theory) was used, and codes were subsequently categorized into subcategories, categories and domains (domain analysis). In total, 834 codes were categorized into 118 subcategories. These subcategories were clustered into 30 categories describing seven different overarching domains: 1) production, 2) transportation, 3) product, 4) product group, 5) consumer, 6) waste and 7) contextual factors. The domains production (31%), transportation (19%) and product (14%) were the largest domains identified in quantitative studies, and in qualitative studies these were production (25%), consumer (20%) and product (20%). Environmental impact, (locally and organic) food choices and ethical production are the most frequent categories mentioned by consumers. However, this literature review also showed that consumers still lack key knowledge on some other specific food-related sustainability topics. In particular, consumers have difficulty defining the concept “sustainability” and to estimate the environmental impact of their food choices. Consumers believe that sustainability does not (yet) influence their food choices. Currently, consumers consider price, taste and individual health more influential than sustainability. It would be useful for policymakers to communicate sustainability knowledge in a transparent, evidence-based and controlled way and to guide consumers by designing a highly regulated and controlled sustainability label.","van Bussel L.M., Kuijsten A., Mars M., van ‘t Veer P.",Consumers’ perceptions on food-related sustainability: A systematic review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124580041&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.130904&partnerID=40&md5=1a22d9e01a2f665ff43c1929a90098be
Journal of Supply Chain Management,"Consumers tend to hold a focal firm responsible for its suppliers' unsustainable practices (chain liability), suggesting that firms need effective responses that can mitigate negative consumer reactions. In applying psychological contract theory to investigate recovery efforts related to such chain liability, the current study addresses three broad focal firm responses: Do nothing, choose a nonsubstantive response that verbally clarifies its own and the supplier's roles in the incident, or substantively rectify the supplier's wrongdoing with sustainability-focused responses, such as termination, monitoring or development. With a vignette-based experiment, we examine consumer perceptions and behaviors in three stages: before the unsustainable supplier incident (pre-incident), after the incident (post-incident) and after the focal firm has responded (post-response). A nonsubstantive, clarification response decreases consumers' purchase intentions; substantive focal firm activities increase purchase intentions, though not fully back to pre-incident levels. For consumers, termination, monitoring and development seem like equally adequate responses. Although combining several substantive responses offers even greater effectiveness for recovering purchase intentions, it still falls short of reaching pre-incident levels. Thus, our findings demonstrate the focal firm's capacity to address suppliers' unsustainable practices substantively and recover, at least partially, its damaged relationship with consumers.","Hartmann J., Forkmann S., Benoit S., Henneberg S.C.",A consumer perspective on managing the consequences of chain liability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124487275&doi=10.1111%2fjscm.12279&partnerID=40&md5=11c2058f88b8ad5c45e2a1aaa6c6e652
Agriculture (Switzerland),"Contemporary agriculture is increasingly oriented toward the synergistic adoption of technologies such as the Internet of Things, Internet of Farming, big data analytics, and blockchain to combine resource protection and economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In Italy, the market growth potential of “Agriculture 4.0” and “Farming 4.0” solutions is very high, but the adoption of the related technological innovations is still low. Italian companies are increasingly aware of the opportunities offered by the 4.0 paradigm, but there are still cultural and technological limits to the full development of the phenomenon. This research aims to contribute to knowledge that will improve the propensity of agricultural operators to adopt the digital solutions of “Agriculture 4.0” by demonstrating its potential, along with its limits. To this end, an integrated methodological approach was adopted, built with focus groups and multicriteria analysis, to define and assess the possible future scenarios resulting from the implementation of digital transformation. The results show an increased focus on solutions that allow the integration of new tools to support those already used in the business organization and at a sustainable cost. To enable the development of “Agriculture 4.0”, we propose that it is necessary to invest in training operators in the supply chain, and above all, raising awareness among farmers, who it is essential fully appreciate the potential benefits of the 4.0 revolution.","Scuderi A., La Via G., Timpanaro G., Sturiale L.",The Digital Applications of “Agriculture 4.0”: Strategic Opportunity for the Development of the Italian Citrus Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126939122&doi=10.3390%2fagriculture12030400&partnerID=40&md5=09f33140877989162597319e3b80cc95

Indeed, physical asset management shifted from the negative image associated with asset failure, expensive maintenance, and decommissioning to an enabler of sustainability that allows us to create and capture value from extended lifetime, renewed functions, and increased awareness. In this direction, this study follows a systematic reviewing process enabled by text analytics methods to identify the means and approaches to build a sustainable perspective for physical asset management. Our key contributions and insights are supported by statistics and key features extracted from over 2800 journal articles. We particularly emphasise the research footprint, the evolution, and research trends of the two most asset-intensive sectors (i.e. construction and energy) represented as barriers and enablers of sustainable development. Lacking a unified perspective of the field, this study proposes a conceptual framework that adopts an asset-within-a-system perspective, recognises the links between the stakeholders and holistically integrates the extracted research trends.

Agricultural Systems,"CONTEXT: Agroforestry is gaining interest in in Europe however the trade-offs associated with its uptake are still uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the sustainability trade-offs and synergies associated with a range of agroforestry systems in Europe and assess the underlying reasons for different performance regarding environmental, economic, social and governance domains. METHODS: Five case-studies of agroforestry from nothern, eastern and southern Europe were assessed using an established sustainability assessment tool, the Public Goods tool (PG tool). The case studies were selected to represent a range of innovative and traditional systems, encompassing arable and livestock, wood fuel and tree fruit crops. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: All five of the case studies were performing well across a diverse range of sustainability criteria, with average scores of three out of five or higher across the assessment categories. Social capital and animal health and welfare management scores were particularly high, due to high rates of on-farm employment of between 0.4 and 2.3 full-time labour units per hectare, and a high volume of local sales alongside effective health planning and husbandry through health planning and a lack of restrictions on natural behaviour. Land Equivalent Ratios were greater than 1 within each case and were particularly high for established silvopasture systems (over 1.5). Fossil fuel use was considerably lower than the industry average in most of the case studies (between 17 and 92% of the country-average per hectare for three of the cases). Economic performance was highly variable, with high labour costs contributing to negative margins. SIGNIFICANCE: The assessments show that agroforestry systems have considerable potential to contribute to multiple sustainability objectives, and that environmental and social sustainability objectives are particularly well addressed through increased efficiency of land-use, increased opportunities for on-farm employment and engagement with local communities. However considerable financial barriers still exist and may prevent its further uptake. Promoting the future uptake of agroforestry in Europe therefore requires the commitment of multiple actors in supply chains to plan policies, farm-practices and knowledge exchange that can support the delivery of sustainability benefits.","Smith L.G., Westaway S., Mullender S., Ghaley B.B., Xu Y., Lehmann L.M., Pisanelli A., Russo G., Borek R., Wawer R., Borzęcka M., Sandor M., Gliga A., Smith J.",Assessing the multidimensional elements of sustainability in European agroforestry systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122639799&doi=10.1016%2fj.agsy.2021.103357&partnerID=40&md5=baa48782f5631fa088363124029c1b34
Landscape Ecology,"Context: In the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the supply of cultural ecosystem services (CESs) is unique, and the demand for CESs is gradually increasing with rapid urbanization. Evaluating the relationship between the supply and demand for CESs is critical for guiding regional sustainable development. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining empirical data in the high altitude and complex topography of the TP, relevant research is still lacking. Objectives: The objective of this study was to develop an approach to address the difficulty of obtaining the empirical data on the TP and to evaluate the relationship between the supply and demand for CESs. Methods: Taking the Qinghaihu–Huangshui basin as an example, we combined the SolVES (Social Values for Ecosystem Services) model and social media big data to evaluate the supply and demand for CESs in the TP. Results: Our results showed that the combined method can effectively evaluate the supply and demand for CESs in the basin, and can be used for other remote regions. The supply and demand for CESs in the basin exhibited obvious spatial mismatch. Among the two types of mismatch, in the areas of high supply and low demand of CESs, residents’ subjective well-being (SWB) were substantially lower. Being far away from central city was an important reason for the high supply and low demand of CESs. Conclusions: Establishing and improving the transportation system connecting central cities with other counties is encouraged to utilize the rich cultural and tourism resources of the TP, as well as enhance the SWB and promote regional sustainable development.","Zhang J., He C., Huang Q., Li J., Qi T.",Evaluating the supply and demand of cultural ecosystem services in the Tibetan Plateau of China,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133289368&doi=10.1007%2fs10980-022-01467-z&partnerID=40&md5=1a11702abd4f563286027636fa74db3b
Agricultural Systems,"CONTEXT: The agri-food system is undergoing pervasive changes in business models, facilitated by the use of digital technologies. Although today it is almost inevitable for any business to adopt some level of digital transformation to strengthen their competitiveness, this transition in the agri-food sector could be more complex, given its characteristics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to analyse worldwide the perceptions of new digital technologies in the agri-food sector expressed within social media platforms, identifying the differences that may exist between them regarding its objectives and social acceptance. METHODS: This paper examines the information regarding digital transformation process in the agri-food sector disseminated worldwide on Twitter. For that purpose, Twitter API is used to gather tweets and descriptive and content analyses, including a sentiment analysis, are performed using R and MAXQDA software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that the digitalization of the agri-food sector is broadly discussed within Twitter. Different actors participate in these information flows, being companies and digital solution providers the most active users and academics and governmental institutions the most visible. Artificial Intelligence was the most mentioned technology, that together with the Internet of Things, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, was related to improving production efficiencies, crop yield, or cost reduction. In the case of Blockchain Technology, it was closer to food supply chain actors, such as distribution companies and marketers. However, all these technologies are connected to the concept of sustainability. The sentiment analysis showed a generally positive tone, indicating social acceptance regarding the starting phase of the adoption of these technologies. The study also identified differences among countries, pointing to a stronger level of engagement with these technologies in developed regions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic was seen as a chance to boost the digital transformation in the sector all over the world. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that data harvested from Twitter provide useful insight into perceptions of digital transformation and different digital technologies in the agri-food value chain across different countries.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Contracts represent key governance mechanisms along the supply chain to pursue collective sustainable strategies in line with new citizen-consumers’ preferences for sustainable products. Adopting an embedded multiple case study approach, this paper explores and analyzes 11 cases of contractual relationships between Italian semolina and pasta producers and farmers in order to investigate whether sustainability strategies affect the design of contracts and the related consequences. Findings reveal that different sustainability strategies correspond to different design and combinations of (both monetary and nonmonetary) contractual incentives aimed to centralize property and decision rights. What emerges is that stronger sustainability strategies entail a higher degree of buyers’ control over strategic investments (such as land and seeds) as well as wider provision of technical assistance and knowledge and innovation transfer toward farmers. Therefore, mutual gains seem at stake, even if socio-economic implications of the shift in decisional and control rights from farmers toward buyers shall be neglected, to ensure a better coherence with the farm to fork strategy and sustainable development goals.","Ciliberti S., Stanco M., Frascarelli A., Marotta G., Martino G., Nazzaro C.",Sustainability Strategies and Contractual Arrangements in the Italian Pasta Supply Chain: An Analysis under the Neo Institutional Economics Lens,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136362378&doi=10.3390%2fsu14148542&partnerID=40&md5=8fe01179f11ebbf89c7a8e6f1cdcee22
Agriculture (Switzerland),"Conventional agricultural systems have contributed to social, economic and environmental problems and are the main threat to global sustainability. In response, theoretical frameworks to describe the transition to sustainable food systems have been proposed, emphasizing the necessity to shift from farm-level solutions to a focus on interactions within the entire value chain, from production to consumption. Despite the emphasis on the importance and potential of consumers to contribute to sustainable agri-food transitions, approaches to their role have remained within the traditional, linear supply chain framework. Marketing approaches view consumers as passive actors, limited to voting with their wallets, which has deepened the disconnection between consumers, producers and nature, resulting in a triple fracture. We analyze the role of the consumer in agri-food systems, contrasting marketing approaches with other consumers/citizens concepts and locate them within sustainability transition frameworks and a multi-level perspective. We discuss the reestablishment of the connection between farmers and consumers and human–nature connectedness and explore this connection mediated through innovative business models, which act as niche innovations with the capacity to influence regimes and landscapes within the multi-level perspective. The role of consumers/citizens in the co-creation of innovative business models is also addressed.","Mehrabi S., Perez-Mesa J.C., Giagnocavo C.",The Role of Consumer-Citizens and Connectedness to Nature in the Sustainable Transition to Agroecological Food Systems: The Mediation of Innovative Business Models and a Multi-Level Perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124295275&doi=10.3390%2fagriculture12020203&partnerID=40&md5=fea56e1467f07d1176237db5bc676063
Foods,"Conventional food supply chains are centralized in nature and possess challenges pertaining to a single point of failure, product irregularities, quality compromises, and loss of data. Numerous cases of food fraud, contamination, and adulteration are daily reported from multiple parts of India, suggesting the absolute need for an upgraded decentralized supply chain model. A country such as India, where its biggest strength is its demographic dividend, cannot afford to malnutrition a large population of its children by allowing them to consume contaminated and adulterated dairy products. In view of the gravity of the situation, we propose a blockchain-enabled supply chain platform for the dairy industry. With respect to the supply chain platform, the dairy products of choice include milk, cheese, and butter. Blockchain is one of the fastest growing technologies having widespread acceptance across multiple industry verticals. Blockchain possesses the power to transform traditional supply chains into decentralized, robust, transparent, tamper proof, and sustainable supply chains. The proposed supply chain platform goes beyond the aspect of food traceability and focuses on maintaining the nutritional values of dairy products, identification of adulteration and contamination in dairy products, the increasing economic viability of running a dairy farm, preventing counterfeit dairy products, and enhancing the revenue of the dairy company. The paper collates the mentioned functionalities into four distinct impact dimensions: social, economic, operations, and sustainability. The proposed blockchain-enabled dairy supply chain platform combines the use of smart contracts, quick response code (QR code) technology, and IoT and has the potential to redefine the dairy supply chains on socio-economic, operational, and sustainability parameters.","Khanna A., Jain S., Burgio A., Bolshev V., Panchenko V.",Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain platform for Indian Dairy Industry: Safety and Traceability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137805814&doi=10.3390%2ffoods11172716&partnerID=40&md5=5cff718cfdaee87ed54a0568e0a66bf3
Energy Reports,"Conventional manufacturing of aeronautic and aerospace parts requires substantial amount of resources (energy and materials) while generating high quantities of waste and carbon dioxide emissions. Metal additive manufacturing (MAM) has the potential to reduce resource consumption, which is particularly important for energy-intensive materials such as titanium. We undertake a systematic literature review of MAM processes for the aerospace/aeronautic sector focusing on energy and material efficiency. Relevant literature was classified and discussed based on the life cycle stages at which resource efficiency strategies for MAM were identified: (1) product design; (2) material development and sourcing; (3) processes development, control, and optimization; (4) end-of-life extension and circular economy. Results highlight the key factors required to optimize MAM and the relevance of assessing its environmental impact compared to conventional manufacturing. Material and energy efficiency vary significantly between different MAM processes due to several factors directly linked to the process but also associated with the supply chain, e.g. electricity mix or material sourcing.

Springer Series in Supply Chain Management,"Coordinating the digital transformation of globally dispersed factories within global manufacturing networks has become critical for competitiveness. From the procurement of raw materials to manufacturing and logistics, and finally to customer fulfillment, digitization is uniting a once siloed supply chain into an integrated end-to-end digital ecosystem. Similarly, for large and complex supply chains, digital transformation has the potential to drive efficiencies, boost innovation, reduce risk, and ensure the flawless operation, increasing the resilience to the disruptions of the production network. In the increasingly competitive global landscape, the Industrial supply chains cannot afford to lose operational efficiencies or ethical practices. Their mission must be to provide high-quality products to customers in a timely, responsible, efficient, and cost-effective manner. Those businesses that pursue their digital goals while also focusing on sustainability will be more resilient and well-positioned for long-term success. Thus, digital transformation achieves the resilient conditions to stay in business during mandatory shutdowns and activity restrictions.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Copper is an important strategic resource for the national economy and social security of China. Water use is a significant component of copper production. However, water shortages and water pollution are two global crises in water resource management. In this study, a copper production industry in China was studied from the perspective of water footprint (WF) and ecological industry (eco-industry). A WF inventory was built by accounting for the entire production and supply chain process, including mining, ore dressing, transportation, smelting, and electrolysis. An index system comprising target, criterion, and variable layers was established to evaluate the sustainable utilization of water resources. It was observed that the studied industry showed a good sustainability for water resource utilization. Only 65.67 tons of freshwater per ton of product was inputted in the entire process due to virtual water (VW) and the use of reclaimed water. However, the WF of each ton of cathode copper product was 162.58 t, and the imported VW of the eco-industry accounted for 92.45%. Increasing the VW import and reducing the VW export can alleviate water shortages. A detailed WF analysis showed that the effects of evaporation and different types of losses on the blue WF (BWF) were significant and should be considered. Upstream water consumption of electricity and other energy sources were also observed to be an important part of the BWF.

Tropical Animal Health and Production,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently spreading worldwide. The pandemic has already had significant adverse effects on human civilization, the environment, and the ecosystem at national and global levels. Moreover, the various sectors of the food production chain, particularly agriculture and livestock, have also been significantly affected in terms of production sustainability and economic losses.

So to develop an ISM–MICMAC-based framework, at first, CSR initiatives were chosen from existing literature with experts’ advice. Later, MICMAC analysis results showed that “employee trainings and workshops” and “employee welfare and empowerment” are significant CSR initiatives that could help CSR’s integration in the food sector of Pakistan, whereas CSR initiatives “community betterment” and “contribution towards economic development” proved least significant in the model.

Journal of Mathematics,"Corporate social responsibility based on competitive supply chain pricing has been considered the most efficient strategy of a business globally. In an MCDM challenge, a competent supply chain pricing considerations solutions supplier considers multiple possibly competing for qualitative and quantitative criteria. This study presented a new extended decision-making and FBWM method based on type-2 fuzzy sets TOPSIS for ranking the corporate social responsibility criteria based on competitive supply chain pricing factors. The aim of the ranking is to learn how a company and its supply chain may accomplish joint-optimization of economic, environmental, and social performance by transparently and strategically integrating sustainability into business operations. To verify the efficacy of the suggested strategy, it is compared to a benchmarking model. IT2F VIKOR is the subject of this benchmarking model. The significance weights of the competitive supply chain pricing selection criterion are determined from BWM for both techniques. The results show that the most probable dimension of social responsibility in knowledge-based businesses in the oil sector, according to the research, is the environmental dimension in social responsibility, which may produce competitive supply chain pricing mechanisms based on profitability. Other findings revealed that the elements of competitive supply chain pricing factors in oil companies regarding social responsibility are ranked as follows: customer, product, and competitive supply chain pricing procedures. As a result, maintaining customer values is a major price element in establishing contacts, based on the company's strategic connection with the economy and regional and worldwide partners.","Salimian F., Damiri M., Ramezankhani M., Fariman S.K.",Developing a New Interval Type-2 Hesitant Fuzzy TOPSIS-Based Fuzzy Best-Worst Multicriteria Decision-Making Method for Competitive Pricing in Supply Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132638074&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f7879028&partnerID=40&md5=f67bb31ba95e1978502e4dd0de823cb5

Frontiers in Environmental Science,"COVID-19 has further strengthened consumers’ online consumption habits and brought a new boom in which enterprises can use online transactions and green products to avoid risk and gain profits in the pandemic. A green supply chain model is established containing one e-commerce platform and one manufacturer. The Nash bargaining contract and Rubinstein bargaining contract are applied to mitigate conflicts of profits in the model. From the coordination analysis, we show that both Nash and Rubinstein bargaining contracts can achieve coordination and mitigate conflict of profits through the adjustment of platform usage rates. According to each member’s bargaining power and patience, the optimal platform usage rate is determined, the supply chain profits of both sides are allocated, the green production’s research and development are promoted, and a win-win situation is realized. Specifically, in the Nash bargaining contract, the excess profit of each member depends on their bargaining power. The stronger the bargaining power, the more excess profits will go to the e-commerce platform, and the less excess profits will go to the manufacturer. In the Rubinstein bargaining contract, the excess profit of each member depends on the lowest profit bound and bargaining patience. The higher the manufacturer’s (or e-commerce platform’s) patience, the higher his profit. When the patience of both is high (or low), the e-commerce platform (or the manufacturer) plays a leading role and obtains more profits.

Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,"COVID-19 has had a strong impact on the food supply chain (FSC) in many countries. The objective of this study was to determine the vulnerability of the FSC in a developing country, namely Peru. The main weakness of the FSC is its centralization, and COVID-19 aggravated this deficit in Peru. This prevents its stability on a large scale, especially in rural areas, which suffer from food and nutritional insecurity. In spite of this, the food system was stabilized due to agricultural, livestock and fishing potential of Peru. In addition, the efforts of local producers and informal vendors helped to maintain the availability of food throughout the country. Several examples of short (and decentralized) FSC were described, highlighting their importance for supplying the population in different areas of the country. In addition, they allow for rapid resolution of interruptions such as the current health crisis. Also mentioned are some suggestions for strengthening Peru's FSC such as the use of new technologies, self-production of food and the exploitation of non-conventional food sources. Emphasis is placed on the importance of environmental sustainability of the FSC and of implementing strategies to prevent illness among workers. This study aims to reflect on the importance of having a resilient and flexible FSC. Taking Peru as a model, the information provided is useful to understand how to improve the food system through the intervention of all the agents involved, such as government, academia, industry and the population.

This paper aims at overcoming these limitations of traditional rating systems by proposing an integrated model of supply chain rating, based on both financial and non-financial variables and including environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators to embrace a long-term orientation of value creation. Enlarging the scope of evaluation from the single company to its supply chain, we realize an integrated ESG–financial model which evaluates both financial and sustainability aspects of organizations, based on the supply chain they belong to. This model is especially useful for evaluating the potential growth of small and medium enterprises which, differently from large corporations, are usually more opaque to financial markets, and present lower disclosure intensity. Therefore, this measurement system can be adopted by both financial institutions, to evaluate potential borrowers, and individual companies, to make internal assessments or to evaluate the performance of their downstream and upstream partners.","Sardanelli D., Bittucci L., Mirone F., Marzioni S.",An integrative framework for supply chain rating: from financial-based to ESG-based rating models,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130151644&doi=10.1080%2f14783363.2022.2069557&partnerID=40&md5=a2e790cbfba1750e03db33bce168cf86

This article uses an exploratory sequential mixed method design to investigate the CFFs for I4.0. In the first explorative qualitative phase, 26 senior managers participated through a purposive sampling frame. The article finds ten CFFs: lack of I4.0 strategy, absence of well-designed smart product&#x002F;service systems, lack of digital supply chains, leadership is not supportive for I4.0, poor human resource management for I4.0, absence of I4.0 technology transformation management plan, I4.0 is not implemented totally, lack of top management support for I4.0, poor change management strategies in place, and inadequate consideration of sustainability in I4.0 initiative.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Critical metal sustainability is a worldwide issue whose extraction relies on hydrometallurgy mostly. The significance of metal ion species evolution in critical metal hydrometallurgy-extraction has got more and more attention. Here, the importance of the metal ion species during the whole vanadium recycling process has been evaluated quantitatively for the first time. Metal ion species as the key parameter was investigated through efficiency, material and energy accounting, and emission accounting to illustrate the effect of the metal ion species, which donated as ion species contribution (ISC). Specifically, 7 types of vanadium ion species were assessed in the process of V2O5 production from leachate, including H2VO4−, HV2O6−, V4O124−, H2V5O14−, V10O286−, HVO42− and VO2+. The results demonstrated that different vanadium ion species were closely related to recovery efficiency and purity, and they impact separation section, materials and energy consumption mostly in whole process. Consequently, V4O124− occupied the highest ISC which was 1.11 times than V10O286−, 1.37 times than VO2+ and 4.85 times than H2VO4−. Correspondingly, control of V4O124− as dominant species appeared to be the most potential in the vanadium extraction process, which showed the feasibility of whole process optimization. With this research, ISC can help to point out dominant ion species in holistic critical metals supply chain, thus promote sustainability of critical metals in a new perspective.","Jia W., Wen J., Yan W., Ning P., Cao H.",Evaluation of ionic species contribution in critical metal extraction: A case study of high-purity vanadium production,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126096450&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.130967&partnerID=40&md5=37dc9fa98a46c7a00f957f3512b25897

Water Research,"Crop production is the biggest water user and key contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing crop yields to ensure adequate food supply under water and land scarcity is excessively dependents on intensive agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, agri-films, or energy), resulting in unintended environmental consequences. Supply chains bringing environmental-intensive inputs from their place of production to the croplands. However, most food-related environmental assessments ignore the environmental burden of agricultural input production, trade, and consumption. Here, we estimate spatially-detailed water (WF) and carbon footprints (CF) of wheat, maize, and rice production in China with extended system boundary from upstream raw material mining to the field. The agricultural inputs account for up to 24% and 89% of a crop's WF and CF, respectively, at the provincial level. The total local generated WF in Chinese northern provinces and CF in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia provinces for producing crops and agricultural inputs transgresses the corresponding downscaled blue water and carbon planetary boundaries. The study broadens the scope of traditional environmental impact assessments in agricultural production and sheds light on the significances to manage the linkages between the crop production and the agricultural inputs’ upstream supply chains towards more efficient water use and less greenhouse gas emissions in food system.","Feng B., Zhuo L., Mekonnen M.M., Marston L.T., Yang X., Xu Z., Liu Y., Wang W., Li Z., Li M., Ji X., Wu P.",Inputs for staple crop production in China drive burden shifting of water and carbon footprints transgressing part of provincial planetary boundaries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133481309&doi=10.1016%2fj.watres.2022.118803&partnerID=40&md5=758df3ba43522897e111901d42632d69
Journal of the Operational Research Society,"Cross-efficiency evaluation in data envelopment analysis (DEA) is effective for evaluating the efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs). The use of cross-efficiency evaluation methods based on prospect theory has recently increased. However, the internal structure of DMUs is often ignored in efficiency evaluation; further, a fixed status quo is often selected as the reference point to calculate relative gains and losses, which is not ideal in the context of prospect theory. To address these issues, we investigate the basic two-stage cross-efficiency evaluation in DEA based on prospect theory. An optimism coefficient is introduced to formulate parameterised dynamic reference points, and a target identification model is developed to obtain target efficiency values that are attainable for all DMUs. Based on the prospect value and target efficiency values, we propose multiple novel aggressive, benevolent, and neutral two-stage cross-efficiency evaluation models. The models proposed herein can be applied to various decision environments and arbitrarily extended to other network system structures. A case study in sustainable supplier selection is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models for DMU ranking.

The demands served are hydrogen for heating and mobility, and electricity for the households. A hydrogen residential heating project currently being developed in Hoogeveen, The Netherlands, served as a case study. Six scenarios were compared, each taking one or multiple energy demand services into question. For each scenario the levelised cost of hydrogen was calculated. The lowest levelised cost of hydrogen was found for the combined heating and mobility scenario: 8.36 € kg−1 for heating and 9.83 € kg−1 for mobility. The results support potential cost reductions of combined demand patterns of different energy services. A sensitivity analysis showed a strong influence of electrolyser efficiency, wind turbine parameters, and emission reduction factor on levelised cost. Wind energy was strongly preferred because of the lower cost and the low greenhouse gas emissions, compared to solar photovoltaics and grid electricity. Increasing electrolyser efficiency and greenhouse gas emission reduction of the used technologies deserve further research.","Tromp E., Bekkering J., Hengeveld E.J., Bellekom S., Aué J.-J.",Cost minimisation of renewable hydrogen in a Dutch neighbourhood while meeting European Union sustainability targets,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132747572&doi=10.1016%2fj.enconman.2022.115903&partnerID=40&md5=1b859fec12a2bb0da9ae958c35d2fd55
IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2022,"Decision-making plays an important role in the field of supply chain management, especially when it deals with evaluating and selecting suppliers (SS). SS is concerned with finding appropriate suppliers based on the criterion defined by a buyer. Suppliers need to be selected wisely to prevent known and unknown consequences that companies may face when a wrong supplier is selected. As such, companies desire to work with preferred suppliers, and develop sustainable relations with these suppliers. With these sustainable relations, they may guarantee high-quality products and services to their customers. Sustainable supplier selection includes aspects such as economic, social, and environmental. In this research, we used agent-based modeling (ABM) as a tool to model a situation where there is a fixed list of suppliers, and the goal is to buy products from a list of suppliers with high sustainability performance; as such, evaluate suppliers based on their sustainability performance while helping them improve their performance. The main incentive behind this research is to find the possible durations that it would take to satisfy the required buyer's demand and achieve high sustainability performance by all suppliers. The output of ABM is being used as an input to a machine learning technique to give insight to decision-makers about durations to find potential suppliers to satisfy the demand. The output of the machine learning technique showed that when the average of suppliers' sustainability performance is greater than a certain level, there is a high probability of satisfying the demand by some predetermined expected duration.","Etemadidavan S., Collins A.J.",A Case Study on The Application of Agent-Based Model in Sustainable Supplier Evaluation and Selection,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137173417&partnerID=40&md5=7b1e37bc382111ea8bead492007e7859
Supply Chain Forum,"Decoupling–a managerial strategy to buffer a company’s social sustainability policy from its daily business practices in order to minimise the impact on operations–has long been studied in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). While the SSCM literature offers many examples of buyers’ decoupling, few publications focus on decoupling by suppliers, who are under pressure from buyers to adopt formal structures, i.e. social sustainability policies. There are even fewer studies exploring workers’ claims related to social issues in this regard. Our study, drawing on the concept of policy-practice decoupling, investigates how suppliers navigate the different expectations of buyers and factory-level workers to find ‘decouple-able’ policies when practising social sustainability. We apply the stakeholder salience theoretical lens to analyse 44 interviews from fieldwork in Vietnam to uncover who and what really counts for local supplier managers in selective decoupling. Along with enriching our understanding of decoupling done by local suppliers, our study uncovers the influence of workers on their managers in shaping and reshaping decoupling.",Le T.-M.T.,Unpacking selective decoupling in global supply chains: a stakeholder salience perspective on social issues in Vietnam’s garment factorie,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139835375&doi=10.1080%2f16258312.2022.2102935&partnerID=40&md5=9aac5cf5c25d329dc66b31423b46224d
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Degradation of the natural environment has raised major concerns about organization sustainability. The growing trend towards integrating responsible environmentalism into the supply chain has required many organizations to pivot to adopting green supply chain practices. In this paper, we assert that the external environment exercises institutional pressure on organizations to adopting a market orientation, aided by managerial commitment, that espouses green supply chain practices as a strategic resource. A survey of 196 manufacturing managers, largely from the United States, United Kingdom, and India, found that institutional pressure had a significant impact on marketing orientation and market orientation had a significant impact on green supply chain practices. Managerial commitment played a key role in strengthening the relationship between market orientation and green supply chain practices. Lastly, the survey found no difference among United States, United Kingdom, and India manufacturers. We postulate that this no difference could be attributable to the tightly coupled systems found within manufacturing.","Gonzalez C., Agrawal V., Johansen D., Hooker R.","Green supply chain practices: The role of institutional pressure, market orientation, and managerial commitment",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135467065&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2022.100067&partnerID=40&md5=0c8dc6cda952bfc04260656dbba47af0
Renewable Energy,"Demand for biomass resources will continue to grow as bioenergy is increasingly targeted within energy strategies. Sustainability is a primary issue for large scale bioenergy, with potential to generate both risks and benefits for people, development, natural systems and for climate change – this balance of risks and benefits determining overall sustainability performance. A new sustainability mapping framework is introduced that provides a flexible tool (BSIM) to map the performances of biomass resources, supply chains, technologies and/or whole value chains against 126 indicators of sustainability. Sustainability maps are developed and assessments undertaken for case studies in the UK and Colombia. This research finds sustainability of bioenergy covers far more issues than those targeted within legislation – where land, carbon and biodiversity are prioritised. Mapping sustainability is a valuable tool to identify the leading risks and benefits to enable targeted actions to mitigate risks and to maximise and promote benefits. Mapping sustainability at different resolutions and analysing the trade-offs enables greater rationalisation of potential risks through also identifying the potential broader benefits gained. Bioenergy is intrinsically linked to the SDGs more so than other renewable technologies and should be used as a mechanism to drive sustainable development.","Welfle A., Röder M.","Mapping the sustainability of bioenergy to maximise benefits, mitigate risks and drive progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129489095&doi=10.1016%2fj.renene.2022.03.150&partnerID=40&md5=1df85ba6eb3aacfa2c49abd55377be32
International Journal of Renewable Energy Development,"Depleting stockpile of fossil fuels and rising global temperature due to the greenhouse effect are probably the two most threatening factors to civilization sustainability. Converting biomass into a readily available energy source will help reduce dependency on fossil fuels, whilst at the same time moderating greenhouse gas emmissions due to its carbon neutrality. Palm oil industry is the largest source of biomass in Indonesia and the available quantity to be utilized is growing inline with the steady growth of the generating industry. Among various wastes from palm oil processing, palm kernel shell is an oil palm biomass with high potential to be applied as a source of energy, given its high caloric value and distinctive physical properties. This source of renewable energy can be utilized by industries with thermal conversion processes. As a prerequisite, a feasibility study on technical, environmental, and economic aspects needs to be carried out. From long term perspective, supply, demand, and regulatory situational analysis will also be required. Lastly, a review on the existing palm kernel shell supply chain will help to understand its current situation. Based on literature studies and field observations, we have identified supply and demand characteristics that will be valuable in constructing an effective, efficient, and sustainable supply chain model of palm kernel shell. Understanding these characteristics is a precursor in realizing this massive potential of renewable energy source in the industrial context.","Handaya H., Susanto H., Indrawan D., Marimin M.",Supply and Demand Characteristics of Palm Kernel Shell as a Renewable Energy Source for Industries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128706335&doi=10.14710%2fijred.2022.41971&partnerID=40&md5=4e9c6149f1bbc5cfc18a3fed00948ef1
EURO Journal on Computational Optimization,"Designing a supply chain to comply with environmental policy requires awareness of how work and/or production methods impact the environment and what needs to be done to reduce those environmental impacts and make the company more sustainable. This is a dynamic process that occurs at both the strategic and operational levels. However, being environmentally friendly does not necessarily mean improving the efficiency of the system at the same time. Therefore, when allocating a production budget in a supply chain that implements the green paradigm, it is necessary to figure out how to properly recover costs in order to improve both sustainability and routine operations, offsetting the negative environmental impact of logistics and production without compromising the efficiency of the processes to be executed. In this paper, we study the latter problem in detail, focusing on the CO2 emissions generated by the transportation from suppliers to production sites, and by the production activities carried out in each plant. We do this using a novel mathematical model that has a quadratic objective function and all linear constraints except one, which is also quadratic, and models the constraint on the budget that can be used for green investments caused by the increasing internal complexity created by large production flows in the production nodes of the supply network. To solve this model, we propose a multistart algorithm based on successive linear approximations. Computational results show the effectiveness of our proposal.","Caramia M., Stecca G.",Sustainable two stage supply chain management: A quadratic optimization approach with a quadratic constraint,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137707672&doi=10.1016%2fj.ejco.2022.100040&partnerID=40&md5=bee3d5eed5bf0162c5d676e945fb3ee3
International Journal of Industrial Engineering and Production Research,"Designing a sustainable and resilient supply chain network is an important area in academic research that has the potential to influence supply chain performance. Increasing regulations in various aspects of sustainability, including environmental protection, is forcing companies to consider their supply chains for economic, environmental and social purposes. On the other hand, the performance of the supply chain may be disrupted for a variety of natural or human reasons. Therefore, designing an efficient supply chain network that is flexible enough in case of disturbances, is a new challenge for supply chain managers. This paper focuses on supply chain sustainability and resilience in which various scenarios such as product life cycle and environmental compatibility, carbon emissions, effluents, and wastes as well as scenarios for managing the occurrence of failure among members are considered. In order to solve the model, Meta-heuristic algorithms, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and subpopulation genetic algorithm (SPGA-II) have been used to find optimal solutions. To compare the efficiency of two algorithms several sample problems are generated and solved that show the Sub-population Genetic Algorithm (SPGA- II) can find good solutions in a reasonable time limit.","Khezeli M., Najafi E., Molana M.H., Seidi M.",A Mathematical Model for Sustainable and Resilient Supply Chain by Considering Synchronization in the Production and Distribution Network,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139564717&doi=10.22068%2fijiepr.33.2.8&partnerID=40&md5=4889391bb430b68ec15799348445b1b8
Neural Computing and Applications,"Designing and modeling a supply chain network are the important steps in determining the costs and time associated with bringing goods to market by evaluating alternate scenarios in light of available resources and locations in the chain. In closed-loop supply chains, the network is extended to include backward chain members and thereby sustainable supply chains are achieved. A network that is optimized can reduce carbon footprint, assist with meeting sustainability goals, improve delivery quality, and ultimately result in an improved customer experience, added value, and differentiation. In this study, a closed-loop supply chain network model is considered to simultaneously optimize the three dimensions of sustainability: economical, environmental, and social. The proposed model is developed using a goal programming technique in supply chain processes with the aim of minimizing costs and environmental damage and maximizing the social benefit. The developed model is integrated with the decision variables regarding the number of workers so as to increase employment, especially regarding the social effects of sustainability. A new model is obtained by weighting the three main dimensions of sustainability with the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process technique. A scenario analysis is conducted to show the impact of the parameters such as capacity, demand, costs, and carbon emissions. According to the scenario analysis results, the parameter having the greatest impact on the decision variables is demand; moreover, where there is an increase of 30% in demand, it has been determined that there is an increase of more than 100% in the number of workers and purchasing costs compared to the base case scenario. In addition, the increase in demand naturally increases transportation costs more than 50% as well.","Salçuk K., Şahin C.",A novel multi-objective optimization model for sustainable supply chain network design problem in closed-loop supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136121268&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-022-07668-6&partnerID=40&md5=5b5cf9c2433fbe6a237989be262e90b4
Environmental Impact Assessment Review,"Despite geopolitics play a pivotal role in the energy sector, geopolitical aspects are often not considered in the quantitative assessment models aimed at supporting the energy investment decision-making process. To address this issue, this work proposes an Extended Multi-regional Input-Output model (EMRIO) that incorporates import dependence and governance along the value chain. As case study, two alternative energy investments in Mexico – a Natural Gas Power plant (NG) and a Concentrated Solar Power plant (CSP) – are assessed. The method quantifies the geographical diversification of suppliers and the quality of governance. The assessment of the case study shows that the supply chain of the CSP plant includes more countries and with better governance levels than the supply chain of the NG power plant. That means, a priori, that the supply risks of investing in CSP power plants will be lower, as will suppliers' endogenous geopolitical risk. However, a sensitivity analysis considering different providers of the solar plant components reveals that CSP plant value chain could also entail similar or even higher governance risks levels as the NG plant. The scenario where China provides some of the components entails a much higher governance risks, even higher than the NG base case. In consequence, we have proved that the method proposed allows the identification of hidden geopolitical risks that would otherwise go unnoticed. This paper enlarges the existing knowledge on assessment methodologies for energy policy decision-support by measuring diversification and imports dependence from countries with different levels of governance along the whole value chain.","Gamarra A.R., Lechón Y., Escribano G., Lilliestam J., Lázaro L., Caldés N.",Assessing dependence and governance as value chain risks: Natural Gas versus Concentrated Solar power plants in Mexico,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120334456&doi=10.1016%2fj.eiar.2021.106708&partnerID=40&md5=1201dcc045ce69a754bb70cceda8f1ef
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Despite it being imperative to a sustainable development, a circular economy remains scarcely adopted by companies. Barriers towards this are extensively explored yet with little focus on their mutual dependencies. Neglecting dependencies is argued to cause suboptimization and lead to unsuccessful circular projects. To counter this and strengthen companies in assessing dependencies among context-dependent barriers towards a circular transition, this study proposes a practice-oriented approach based on an interpretive structural modelling methodology. This is validated through a case study with a Danish mechatronics manufacturer with which fourteen semi-structured interviews, a survey, and a workshop were conducted. Findings reveal an interwoven network of barriers with numerous chain mechanisms across managerial, market-related, financial, technical, and regulative aspects, which underpins the need to approach the circular transition systemically. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the ability of the methodology to facilitate discussions and assist industrial practitioners, both on a strategic and operational level, in systematically untangling the complex interrelations to identify root causes for inertia and prioritize mitigation measures.","Jensen S.F., Kristensen J.H., Uhrenholt J.N., Rincón M.C., Adamsen S., Waehrens B.V.",Unlocking Barriers to Circular Economy: An ISM-Based Approach to Contextualizing Dependencies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137066136&doi=10.3390%2fsu14159523&partnerID=40&md5=1e783e5fc2ba29e085ff3b11f6116132
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Despite its clear potential to contribute to sustainability, there are many challenges to adopting circular economy (CE). These barriers impede the implementation of CE; however, research to address them is ongoing. For example, novel technologies have become a key enabler for easing the impact of CE adoption barriers. Blockchain is one disruptive technology that has the potential to address some of those barriers, notably technological, organizational, and ecological. Blockchain is particularly well suited to help address supply chain-oriented barriers to CE adoption. However, a review of the literature shows that while there are a limited number of conceptual studies that address the capabilities of blockchain to alleviate the impact of the barriers to CE, no previous study has focused on this vital subject using a decision tool based on expert data. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated decision framework involving Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-based Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method with Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) to investigate the true potential of blockchain to address the CE adoption barriers.

Supply Chain Forum,"Despite practitioners’ and scholars’ increasing awareness of sustainable innovation (SI), studies that integrate sustainability, innovation, practices and supply chains (SCs) are still overlooked in the literature. In contrast to most supply chain management (SCM) research, which has typically focused on the dominant focal companies’ perspective, this qualitative research examines how suppliers’ SIs are diffused along textile and cosmetics SCs. Drawing on practice-based studies and the diffusion of innovation theory, we identify SI diffusion as a practice that comprises three sequential activities (presenting, evaluating and implementing). By conceiving of SI diffusion as a practice, we demonstrate that each of these activities is articulated around practical understanding, ends and emotions. This study contributes to the literature by answering different calls to integrate other theories into the SCM field and to move away from the taken-for-granted meaning of practices. Moreover, it sheds light on suppliers as initiators of SI diffusion. Finally, our main contribution is the focus on emotions in the diffusion process. More specifically, we reveal that sustainability, practices and emotions cannot be dissociated, extending current SCM studies that have focused on the rational dimension.","Carmagnac L., Naoui-Outini F.",Emotions and ends matter: Exploring the Practice of Sustainable Innovation Diffusion,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139383760&doi=10.1080%2f16258312.2022.2128693&partnerID=40&md5=8ab14ed15301ef534fc95f9ca67004ce

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Despite the benefits of reducing virgin plastic polymers in food packaging, the spread of reusable systems is limited by organizational and economic constraints, and reasonable doubts about their real environmental impacts still persist. Several studies have evaluated the environmental sustainability of reusable plastic containers (RPCs) compared to single-use systems; however, the trade-offs and benefits of reuse are not always clear. To model real-world network complexity with its bottlenecks and unbalanced infrastructural networks, primary data on traveled distances and flows collected throughout the logistics network must be included in the analysis. The material-driven characterization of the secondary package's logistic networks justifies the integration of Geographic Information Systems into LCA to overcome the limitations of using only secondary data, which is commonly done. This study evaluated alternative secondary packaging systems (SPSs) and associated material-driven networks using a spatial Life Cycle Assesment (LCA) approach augmented with a supply chain digital twin. The material-driven network flows were virtualized, and the resulting data on transportation emissions and fuel consumption represent the LCA input. The networks serve a countrywide Food Supply Chain (FSC) from growers to retailers, with up to 1600 nodes located in Italy over a 10-year time span. In this study, the Life Cycle Environmental Impact (LCEI) of nine alternative SPSs differing in size and material-driven network, that is, reusable polypropylene (PP) crates, single-use corrugated cardboard boxes (CCBs), and single-use PP crates, were investigated. The novel contributions of the study lie in the method, scale of analysis, and accuracy of spatial data collection. The results show that the higher transportation emissions of RPCs (+23.80% compared with that of CCBs) are balanced by the reduced production and disposal impacts per use. After 10 years, the environmental impacts of the single-use SPSs are higher than those of the RPC SPSs in all the impact categories evaluated. Considering GWP20, the RPCs are environmentally friendly after only 15 rotations. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of LCA results to transport parameters and highlights the importance of adopting supply chain digital twins to enhance the accuracy of the environmental profile of such complex logistic ecosystems.","Accorsi R., Battarra I., Guidani B., Manzini R., Ronzoni M., Volpe L.",Augmented spatial LCA for comparing reusable and recyclable food packaging containers networks,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138387283&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.134027&partnerID=40&md5=bfadac8268e515a0fc2a975b35cdfee8
Journal of Computational Science,"Despite the fact that Iran is one of the main world's stone producers with more than 6000 stone-cutting centers, its share barely holds one percent of the world market. The industry, hence, awaits effective measures to increase its exports of building stone products. It is assumed in the present study that public-private partnership based on a win-win approach might not only facilitate foreign trades by different industries but also enhance export opportunities and improve production efficiency. Accordingly, efforts are made in the present study to investigate both production and supply networks in conjunction with the hitherto less heeded demand allocation. It is the objective to exploit functional criteria in each of these networks that will guarantee efficiency and functional values based on domestic and international demands. The way each player participates in its respective network and handles feedback from other players depends on the his/her conditions and the performance of the various players/components of the network they are part of. To determine these parameters, use is made in this study of the network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) with the efficiency of each industrial unit in the network considered as the weight of that unit within a game theoretic framework. More specifically, given the importance of exports and trade commodities as well as the great impacts such industrial units as R&D and sales departments have on international markets and marketing, the weights associated with each industrial unit is calculated via the network data envelopment analysis that takes into account not only the effects of all the network components but also those of the parameters affecting their efficiency. Thus, all the factors involved in the evaluation of the supply chain are initially identified based on the SCOR model and the balanced scorecard that additionally includes sustainability criteria. The model is implemented on the data extracted from a survey of 10 stone-cutting plants, the supply chain network of which is determined based on a study of their structures and the criteria considered in the relevant sub-networks. In a subsequent stage, after implementing PCA, the NDEA model is solved for each of the subnetworks in GAMS software and the efficiency of each plant is obtained using the weights obtained from the demand allocation model within a game theoretic framework. The output from the model solved in GAMS indicates that, compared to the current situation, application of the integrated model proposed in this study leads to a significant increase in the profits gained from each customer demand; the profits earned is expressed as the number of orders placed with each plant.","Moazeni H., Arbab Shirani B., Hejazi S.R.",An integrated game theoretic model and network data envelopment analysis to determine optimal export allocation to industrial units (A case study of the stone industry),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138469976&doi=10.1016%2fj.jocs.2022.101868&partnerID=40&md5=99e622665e72b30ae9623395070d503b
Journal of Management,"Despite the significant increase in interest in sustainable business practices, decisions on switching to more environmentally friendly input materials are understudied. In a conjoint experiment, we presented 267 Finnish manufacturing firms with an opportunity to acquire an alternative, more ecological input material and investigated their willingness to switch to that material. We find that in general, firms are willing to substitute their current principal input with a more ecological alternative under conditions of functional parity. However, such willingness is contingent on the firm’s value creation structures. Specifically, if the products and processes driving the firm’s value creation rely more on tangible materials (high materiality), firms anticipate higher input-switching costs, which leads to inertia and slows the adoption of alternative, environmentally friendlier inputs. However, if a firm’s value creation is driven more by intangible assets, like intellectual property and amortizable development costs, input-switching costs appear lower. Such firms not only find it easier to adopt ecological inputs but may also derive greater benefit from leveraging the positive reputation effects associated with ecological improvements. By exploring how willingness to switch to an alternative input material is constrained by organizational structures, our findings contribute to research on input substitution and theories of external influence, like demand-side research, stakeholder theory, and ecological responsiveness.","Schillebeeckx S.J.D., Kautonen T., Hakala H.",To Buy Green or Not to Buy Green: Do Structural Dependencies Block Ecological Responsiveness?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097784206&doi=10.1177%2f0149206320977896&partnerID=40&md5=1cae6e728ed8835357edfe031fc68853
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Despite their importance in all transportation chains, logistical sites—and in particular refrigerated facilities—are the weakest link in current emissions literature. This is largely due to a lack of quantitative research that focuses on these facilities. This article is the first of its kind to assess the emissions of eight refrigerated facilities that handle and store fresh fruit. In 2020, the analyzed facilities moved a total of 646,572 pallets of fresh fruit and emitted 32,225 t of CO2 e. Five of the largest facilities were responsible for handling 18.83% of the total fresh fruit exported from South Africa during 2020. The results revealed that storing and handling a pallet of fruit in a large-scale commercial cold store requires 7.62 kWh of electricity per day. Storing and handling fresh fruit is carbon intensive since each pallet stored translates to 7.52 kg CO2 e d−1. However, other factors such as the seasonality and volume of fruit handled, facility characteristics and the availability of solar electricity systems, among others, all have a significant impact on the emissions value of the facility and on the emission intensity per pallet moved through the facility.","du Plessis M.J., van Eeden J., Goedhals-Gerber L.L.",The Carbon Footprint of Fruit Storage: A Case Study of the Energy and Emission Intensity of Cold Stores,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132988768&doi=10.3390%2fsu14137530&partnerID=40&md5=434067313ca8db8a4a38397865bdf99c
Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Despite their important role in the fight against global climate change, the coordination of green pharmaceutical supply chains (GPSC) has rarely been studied. To fill this research gap and realize the optimal green performance of GPSC, this study aimed to investigate the coordination of a GPSC considering green investment, green logistics, and government intervention. Using a game-theoretic approach, we establish decision models and analyze the equilibrium strategies in several GPSC scenarios. A linked two-part tariff (LTPT) contract is proposed for the coordination of the GPSC. In addition, we explore the many important implications of changes in the parameters. This research shows that, under different conditions, governments should reasonably implement different interventions in order to promote the positive global performance of GPSC. Government intervention can increase the benchmark height and make more room for green improvement. The proposed LTPT contract can assist in the realization of GPSC coordination, obtain a greater consumer surplus, and achieve optimal green performance. Higher flexibility-influence coefficients of green degree on costs are conducive to the emission reductions and sustainable development of GPSC. Moreover, cultivating green preference in the market can save the government expenditures on subsidies. When the green investment coefficient of a GPSC is larger, the GPSC members lack motivation for green improvement, and the government needs to provide more subsidies rather than taxes in order to improve the green degree of the GPSC.

Current Issues in Tourism,"Despite Volunteer Tourism (VT) being firmly rooted in sustainability, there is a lack of detailed understanding of how the VT supply chain influences sustainability. Specifically, while recent analytical frameworks evaluating relations in the VT supply chain have detected power imbalances amongst the main stakeholders, little is known about how and why the different active components of VT stakeholders’ relations influence sustainability. Based on a case study of the four main stakeholders in VT (sending and receiving organizations, volunteers, and host projects), this paper illustrates the nuanced details of how collaborative relations within the supply chain can lead to sustainability. The study determines how and why VT organizations’ values are the main drivers for the VT supply chain to achieve sustainability outcomes. It demonstrates how operationalising power-sharing and shared decision-making throughout the whole supply chain enables VT to improve sustainability performance. In the surveyed host projects, accumulative short-term outcomes (based on skills transfer and confidence building) can facilitate long-term transformative change such as social mobility.","Eckardt C., Font X., Kimbu A.",Collaborations in volunteer tourism,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112668473&doi=10.1080%2f13683500.2021.1955842&partnerID=40&md5=31bfb332b3f82ac2bc7834bcdc68008e
International Journal of Technology,"Developing oil palm agroindustry in South Kalimantan involves internal and external factors for its sustainability. The long distance of each stakeholder requires a digitally connected system. The research aimed at identifying criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives in the developed network model, determine the sensitivity to determine the relevance of actor's role, determine the effectiveness and efficiency before and after implementation of the system, and analyse the level of certainty and importance of assumptions developed. The methods used were surveys, focus group discussions, and questionnaires. Experts in the Analytical Network Process (ANP) method were from academia, business, society and government. Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) method to analyse supply chain performance involved 178 respondents. The level of certainty and importance of assumptions was with Strategic Assumption Surfacing and Testing (SAST). The results of the analysis show there was an interdependence between the sub-criteria on the specified criteria and alternatives applied to achieve the goals. Pairwise comparisons showed the highest sub-criteria cluster was the replanting program with a weight of 0.662, for alternative cluster the highest priority weight in the system involving all actors playing a role was 0.391, with relevant sensitivity test results. The results of the analysis of effectiveness and efficiency before and after implementation of the system showed an increase in SCOR value for all actors. The results of SAST analysis were in Quadrant I with the highest level of importance and certainty of 7.6 meaning very important and certain.

And the debate as to whether using sustainability for strategic positioning, e.g differentiation, is still a hot topic in literature. To that end, we investigated if green certification of 17 Turkish ports have been used with similar purpose. In this context, this study aims to find out whether the certification attempts of ""green ports"" in ports that are strategic nodes of global supply chains are strategically justified or just an action to catch up with other competitors. Drawing on qualitative analyses, a green port corpus content has been prepared. This corpus is comprised of 17 green certificated port CEOs’ interviews and their website contents.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"Digital supply chains have revolutionised manufacturing firms by helping them address the challenges of a dynamic environment. Firms implement low-carbon practices to achieve environmental sustainability. This paper explores whether digital supply chain networks can influence the sustainable performance of manufacturing firms and the mediating effect of low-carbon practices in the contingency factor of environmental dynamism (ED). The relationship is examined in terms of information processing theory and stakeholder theory and from the perspective of a resource-based view (RBV). The proposed framework is tested using structural equation modelling. The results show that low-carbon practices have a partial mediation effect on digital supply chains and the sustainable performance of manufacturing firms. Furthermore, ED moderates the relationship of low-carbon practices and digital supply chain networks. The study can support managers as they design strategies to move towards a low-carbon economy, enhancing the firm's sustainable performance in accordance with ED.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"Digital technologies (DTs), such as the Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, or blockchain, are considered as enablers for a more sustainable and circular economy. So far, literature on these topics has mostly focused on specific DTs and subareas of sustainable product management (SPM). The aim of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive overview of current and potential examples of DT applications in SPM (e.g., product design/assessment, supply chain management, and business models). The collected examples (n = 146) were analyzed based on a systematic literature review, using quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Deductive and inductive analyses of the examples revealed the potential of DTs in terms of their usability along the product life cycle, their role as enablers for circular economy strategies and in specific SPM activities. DT application often entails only incremental improvements, for example, increased efficiency of existing processes, with more radical forms of improvement remaining relatively scarce. There is clear room for greater adoption and optimization of DTs, in various areas of SPM, so as to accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable and circular economy.","Rusch M., Schöggl J.-P., Baumgartner R.J.",Application of digital technologies for sustainable product management in a circular economy: A review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128184753&doi=10.1002%2fbse.3099&partnerID=40&md5=dc23d8a9b81dd8d5ca5a4e699001993a

However, contributions addressing the sectoral level of analysis are still nascent in the digital twin literature. This paper has a dual research objective of (1) identifying the digital twin potential at a sectoral level of analysis and (2) investigating whether the existent Enterprise Architectures (EA) approaches and languages meet the requirements for the creation of digital twin architectures. A design science research project was conducted in a leading business association representing the Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Sector (RACS). Our findings reveal that RACS digital twins will need to address the grand challenges of climate change and sustainability. Moreover, the digital twin-driven transformation of RACS will be more effective in cooperation between different supply chain segments, increasing the importance of business associations’ role in the definition of reference architectures for their sector.

Annals of Operations Research,"Digitalisation is expected to transform end-to-end supply chain operations by leveraging the technical capabilities of advanced technology applications. Notwithstanding the operations-wise merits associated with the implementation of digital technologies, individually, their combined effect has been overlooked owing to limited real-world evidence. In this regard, this research explores the joint implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain Technology (BCT) in supply chains for extending operations performance boundaries and fostering sustainable development and data monetisation. Specifically, this study empirically studied the tuna fish supply chain in Thailand to identify respective end-to-end operations, observe material and data-handling processes, and envision the implementation of AI and BCT. Therefore, we first mapped the business processes and the system-level interactions to understand the governing material, data, and information flows that could be facilitated through the combined implementation of AI and BCT in the respective supply chain. The mapping results illustrate the central role of AI and BCT in digital supply chains’ management, while the associated sustainability and data monetisation impact depends on the parameters and objectives set by the involved system stakeholders. Afterwards, we proposed a unified framework that captures the key data elements that need to be digitally handled in AI and BCT enabled food supply chains for driving value delivery. Overall, the empirically-driven modelling approach is anticipated to support academics and practitioners’ decision-making in studying and introducing digital interventions toward sustainability and data monetisation.","Tsolakis N., Schumacher R., Dora M., Kumar M.",Artificial intelligence and blockchain implementation in supply chains: a pathway to sustainability and data monetisation?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132150254&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-022-04785-2&partnerID=40&md5=d11d27c2bf7c5cbe6ebab37eb04a85ae
Business Strategy and the Environment,"Digitalization of the supply chain (SC) has received plenty of attention from practitioners and researchers in recent years to address the challenges of the business environment and assist firms in achieving a circular SC. Implementing circularity in business operations is a practice of achieving sustainability which is of utmost significance for achieving sustainable development goals established by the United Nations. This study empirically examines the relation among flexibility, AI–IoT adoption, and SC firm performance under the circular economy (CE) environment based on resource orchestration theory (ROT), an integrated version of the extended-resource-based view, and dynamic capability theory (DCT). Data were collected from Indian manufacturing firms through a questionnaire-based survey and examined using “structural equation modeling (SEM).” The study results show that information flexibility and organizational flexibility have the highest impact on AI–IoT adoption. Organizational flexibility shows full mediation with AI–IoT, which would influence the SC firm performance directly. The analysis also indicates that CE will affect the relation between organizational flexibility and AI–IoT adoption. These findings pave the way for cross-country analysis, formation of practical strategies, and policies related to AI–IoT and CE implementations.","Nayal K., Kumar S., Raut R.D., Queiroz M.M., Priyadarshinee P., Narkhede B.E.",Supply chain firm performance in circular economy and digital era to achieve sustainable development goals,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119086749&doi=10.1002%2fbse.2935&partnerID=40&md5=3f884dfcbc482dda20c5c2b10b430909

Cleaner Environmental Systems,"Digitization is one of the megatrends of our time. New production and supply chain methods are introduced in the industry, which fundamentally change the previous workflows. An area in which digitization can bring about major changes in the spare parts business. One approach to develop the spare parts business regarding technology and sustainability is the digital spare parts concept. The concept follows the goal to produce decentral in the required quantity and at the required location. The research focuses on the calculation of carbon emissions to compare the subtractive and additive production of metal parts and their transport ways. A literature review analyses existing studies and quantifies the main carbon emission drivers of the production of metal spare parts production. With the help of the DHL Carbon Calculator, the transport emissions are identified. Depending on the urgency of the spare part, transport varies between ship, train, truck or airplane on different distances. A data set of 27,000 scenarios is analysed. It is shown, that the transport routes are not the major driver for carbon emissions along the whole process chain.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Disruption in many supply chains has shown the vulnerability of global supply networks, especially resource-intensive ones, due to the simultaneous effects of pandemics and geopolitical crises. Reshoring and nearshoring strategies are the possible responses of manufacturing companies to disruptions in order to adapt to unforeseen events. The supply chain for the Italian ceramic sector, which is characterized by a high intensity of natural and energy resource consumption and a sourcing system with a high geopolitical risk, is examined in this study. The functional decomposition technique was used to analyze the supply chain; then, three scenarios were developed as potential remedies for the unexpected termination of Ukrainian plastic clay supply. The study also showed that complex issues require multifaceted analysis approaches, which is why a transdisciplinary approach was chosen. In addition, the analysis of the ceramic industry showed that nearshoring and reshoring strategies can reduce supply risk and have a positive impact on the environment. The study also showed how bringing extraction sources closer to factories significantly reduces CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from transportation.

ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Distributed ledger technology (DLT) like blockchain technology (BCT) is expected to have the power to improve sustainability in supply chains. To summarize and organize the insights of research in information systems (IS) on how BCT relates to transparency and, ultimately, sustainability of supply chains, this paper conducts a structured literature review. In total 46 articles have been identified and analyzed. The analysis shows that the potential of BCT to facilitate transparency in supply chains and thus enable sustainability measures stems from its decentralized and distributed nature. Further, BCT does not unfold this potential on its own; rather it is a technology that complements existing IS used to manage inter-organizational transactions. Overall, the paper contributes to the literature by providing a deeper insight into the possibilities, features, and merits of BCT in the SCM context, mainly focusing on transparency and sustainability matters. Summarizing and organizing the advantages of BCT and the shortcomings of existing IS used in SCM as discussed in prior research, this paper emphasizes that BCT needs to be considered as a complementary technology.

Renewable Energy,"Drop-in biofuels, which are functionally equivalent to petroleum-based transportation fuels and fully compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure, have been widely used in developed countries in recent decades as an effective means of reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions emitted by fossil fuels. The most challenging obstacles to biofuel development are the widespread access to cheap fossil fuels, high costs of constructing biorefineries, and potential disruptions in the biofuel supply chain (SC). This paper proposes a practical optimization model for the development of drop-in biofuels using the existing petroleum infrastructure. The model takes potential supply and production disruptions into account, and investigates four proactive strategies: flexible supply contracts, infrastructure fortification, alternative production routes, and prepositioning of emergency inventory to improve overall SC resilience. Furthermore, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic program is developed to cope with uncertainty where a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is used as the risk measure. By integrating the planning and operational decisions in this decision-making framework, we explore the best available solutions to ensure both economic and environmental sustainability. In the end, the applicability of the proposed model is verified through a real-world case study.

Algal Research,"Due to enjoying such features as ability to produce high volumes of oil and reducing and eliminating environment carbon dioxide, microalgae is a promising solution for producing biofuels. In order to help the commercialization of this emerging industry, the present study offers a sustainable mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) for designing and planning microalgae biofuel production and distribution network. As objective functions, this model considers minimizing the total cost of the network and maximizing greenhouse gas emission saving simultaneously. In order to design microalgae biofuel sustainable production and distribution network, a two-stage approach is developed. In order to reduce computational complexity, at first place, data envelopment analysis approach (DEA) and Combinative Distance-Based Assessment (CODAS) approach as well as best worst method (BWM) are developed respectively for determining the location of suitable candidates for establishing microalgae production facilities and constructing biorefinery based on economic, social and environmental criteria.

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Due to extensive industrial activities, many environmental challenges have devastated human beings and environmental integrity. Therefore, sustainable supply chain (SC) practices (lean, green, and agile — LGA) gained momentum in the manufacturing industry. Considering the importance of LGA-SC, this study investigates the impact of LGA-SC practices on green innovation (GI), supply chain competitive advantage (SCPA), supply chain responsiveness (SCR), and sustainable firm performance (SFP). Data were collected from employees of the manufacturing industry in China. The proposed conceptual framework was verified by using structural equation modeling. The empirical results indicate that LGA-SC practices are statistically associated with GI, SCR, SCPA, and SFP. Moreover, this research finds that GI and SCR play mediating roles between LGA-SC practices and SCPA. GC positively moderates the relationship between LGA-SC practices and GI, and IP also acts as a strong moderator between GI and SCPA. To the authors’ best knowledge, this study is the pioneer to provide insights about a novel framework combing LGA-SC practices, SCPA, and SFP with mediating role of GI and moderating role of GI and IP.

Natural Hazards,"Due to global warming and rising sea levels, Honolulu, Hawai’i—a city on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean—is becoming more vulnerable to climate disasters. This article utilizes a mixed-method approach to investigate the challenges of maintaining disaster relief supply chains in the face of the emerging risks to Honolulu. We conduct eighteen in-depth interviews with key emergency management stakeholders to understand current approaches to supply chain risk management. Based on the research, three main challenges influence disaster preparedness in Hawai’i. First, the physical location of the island and the spatial distribution of risk, assets, and capabilities supporting emergency relief present large, unusual constraints not found in other jurisdictions. Second, the challenges of supply chain management, planning, communications and coordination are exacerbated during disruptions and disaster events. Unlike other states, with neighboring, contiguous jurisdictions, there are severe limitations to mutual aid and assistance from outside sources. Third, our research has also identified cultural challenges associated with social, political, and economic development and change. Stronger institutional collaboration both within the state and beyond its boundaries are key to increased supply chain resilience and effective response and recovery from disasters. We conduct social network analysis focusing on measures of density, degree, betweenness, and centrality to better understand the status and gaps in institutional collaboration. The social network analysis reveals that the current levels of collaboration are relatively low with significant gaps between government agencies and the private sector, as well as limited vertical collaborations with respect to supply chain management between federal, state and local partners. There is a need for stronger leadership with deeper engagement across stakeholders. A pathway forward includes: (1) vulnerability analyses focused on private sector supply chain management and public sector transport hubs, networks, and facilities, (2) exercises and training on emergency supply chain management, and (3) longer-term actions to support sustainability, self-sufficiency, local production, and community resilience.

However, not many studies have been developed to understand the decision-making process in sustainable manufacturing. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review on the application of multi-Attribute decision-making (MADM) methods in sustainable manufacturing. A total of 158 papers, published between 2009 and 2018, met the criteria set in the research methodology. The 158 papers were then analyzed and classified into seven categories: (i) SM domain, (ii) activity within the organization, (iii) decision goals, (iv) decision-makers involved (group or individual), (v) uncertain data, (vi) SM aspects (social, environmental, and economic), and (vii) MADM methods. Among the results, we identified that AHP is the most applied MADM method and, regarding the activities of the organization, MADM methods have been the most frequently applied to strategy management and supply chain. We also identified a tendency to consider uncertain and imprecise data in the decision-making process. Another result is that all the three domains-economic, environmental and social-were considered in most of the papers, followed by the combination of the economic and environmental perspectives. In the conclusion, some recent trends and future research directions are highlighted.","Pelissari R., Khan S.A., Ben-Amor S.",Application of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Methods in Sustainable Manufacturing Management: A Systematic Literature Review and Analysis of the Prospects,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120426664&doi=10.1142%2fS0219622021300020&partnerID=40&md5=df812fa418df0cbbd2a0038f92e89494
International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Due to increasingly serious environmental pollution problems and governments’ strengthening of environmental impact supervision, manufacturing companies are seeking green production methods, implementing carbon trading systems, and promoting the trend towards green remanufacturing. Thus, this paper introduces green factors to the existing closed-loop supply chain network models and studies the impact of carbon trading, green innovation efforts, and green consumers on the choice between two remanufacturing strategies: an in-house remanufacturing strategy and an authorized remanufacturing strategy. The results concerning the choice of the remanufacturing strategy are as follows: from the perspective of obtaining more profits, when the carbon trading price is low, the companies choose the authorized remanufacturing strategy; when the carbon trading price is high, the companies choose to remanufacture by themselves. For all the green innovation efforts and the proportions of green consumers, when the recovery rate of the used product is low, the companies choose to remanufacture by themselves; when the recovery rate of the used product is high, the companies choose the authorized remanufacturing strategy.","Zhou Y., Lin X.-T., Fan Z.-P., Wong K.-H.","Remanufacturing Strategy Choice of a Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Considering Carbon Emission Trading, Green Innovation, and Green Consumers",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131075968&doi=10.3390%2fijerph19116782&partnerID=40&md5=d628d1d8600ebb98abaf42d484846cf1
Science of the Total Environment,"Due to its strategic position and direct relationship with multiple stakeholders, the HoReCa sector can be a crucial node for the promotion of sustainability in the agri-food chain. However, the sector is currently responsible for a high environmental, social, and economic load. A recent response to these impacts is the diffusion of initiatives that assess and promote sustainable practices at the catering business level. The study aims to verify, using a scientific methodology, how current sustainability programs enable the HoReCa sector to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the level of implementation of sustainable practices in the Italian context. To this end, seven currently available national and international sustainability programs were selected, analyzed, and compared. A matrix approach was adopted to understand the balance of the programs with respect to the three pillars of sustainability. A more in-depth analysis was conducted on the Italian Ristorazione Sostenibile 360 (RS 360) case study, which was analyzed both in terms of compliance with the SDGs and in terms of the sustainability performance of the 29 restaurants that participated in the pilot phase of the project. Although the programs differ from each other, they comply with the 2030 Agenda goals, with a particular focus on achieving Goal 12. Furthermore, the analysis highlighted how a balance between the social, environmental, and economic spheres is essential to ensure the sustainable growth of the sector and to bring benefits to the community. As for the case study, 76 % of the analyzed restaurants achieve at least 70 % of the maximum level of fulfillment of the SDGs achievable by the HoReCa sector. This is a symptom of the sector's potential to contribute to supply chain sustainability. However, continuous improvement is essential to ensure the resilience of the HoReCa sector in the future.","Di Pierro R., Frasnetti E., Bianchi L., Bisagni M., Capri E., Lamastra L.",Setting the sustainable development targets for restaurants and Italian HoReCa sector,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139047237&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.158908&partnerID=40&md5=7992ea9e8c7b3c041a4aed2f4512c610
Energy Conversion and Management: X,"Due to limited fossil fuel resources and their negative environmental impacts, investment in solar photovoltaic energy has been increasing markedly. Benefiting from photovoltaic systems to fulfill the demand for energy is accompanied by various risks that must be considered. This research studies photovoltaic power plants and their supply chains. In particular, it proposes a new framework for risk management of them based on the five dimensions of sustainable development. This framework employs a combination of the failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and the proposed fuzzy election based on relative value distances (FERVD) method to assess and prioritize risks. This proposed fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) method relies on prospect theory and fuzzy logic. The research benefits from literature review and expert interviews for the identification of risks. Expert opinions are also used for the assessment, prioritization, analysis, and treatment of these risks. The results indicate that 70% of total risks and 57% of critical risks are imposed on the supply chain from outside a power plant. Moreover, it is shown that economic risks, that account for 37% of total risks and 86% of critical risks, are by far the most significant threats to this industry, followed by technical and institutional risks. It is also demonstrated that photovoltaic energy has minimal adverse impacts on social and environmental dimensions of sustainability.","Shojaeimehr S., Rahmani D.",Risk management of photovoltaic power plants using a novel fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method based on prospect theory: A sustainable development approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138434028&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecmx.2022.100293&partnerID=40&md5=e4f81ba414aaacbda74f0fd692eb3983
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Due to severe biodiversity and climate crises, there is now a need for sustainable supply chains. Food supply chains contribute to biodiversity loss, especially through land use and agriculture. In addition, energy-intensive storage for refrigeration and intercontinental transportation lead to high emission along chains due to seasonality. Selecting and prioritizing decarbonization actions is a key task for decision makers along food supply chains this decade. Often, modernizing supply chains by integrating information and digital technologies is seen as beneficial for environmental goals. The aim of this work is to develop a new systematization of sustainability measures based on archetypal sustainability strategies (sufficiency, consistency, and efficiency) that support the prioritization and thus the selection of decarbonization measures. Existing measures will be researched through a structured literature review. At the same time, it is recorded how they are categorized or systematized. Forty-eight different systematizations are analyzed. The majority relate to specific sectors and are not generally transferable. Sustainability is often addressed using the triple bottom line. In particular, efficiency and consistency measures are often included in the categories found but are rarely used for systematization. A new systematization of sustainability measures is proposed and applied to a set of digitalization and logistics 4.0 measures using the example of a fresh apple supply chain. The advantages of the proposed systematization are discussed, and further research directions are given. The presented method has not been examined in the literature so far; this concerns both the width and depth of the consideration of supply chains.","Brinken J., Trojahn S., Behrendt F.","Sufficiency, Consistency, and Efficiency as a Base for Systemizing Sustainability Measures in Food Supply Chains",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132297747&doi=10.3390%2fsu14116742&partnerID=40&md5=002b5e1bd597c982285c11681b9db770
International Journal of Production Research,"Due to the complexity and the magnitude of optimisation models that appeared in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), the use of meta-heuristic algorithms as competent solution approaches is being increased in recent years. Although a massive number of publications exist around SSCM, no extant paper explicitly investigates the role of meta-heuristics in the sustainable (forward) supply chain. To fill this gap, a literature review is provided on meta-heuristic algorithms applied in SSCM by analyzing 160 rigorously selected papers published by the end of 2020. Our statistical analysis ascertains a considerable growth in the number of papers in recent years and reveals the contribution of 50 journals in forming the extant literature. The results also show that in the current literature the use of hybrid meta-heuristics is overtaking pure meta-heuristics, the genetic algorithm (GA) and the non-dominated sorting GA (NSGA-II) are the most-used single- and multi-objective algorithms, the aspects of sustainability are mostly addressed in connection with product distribution and routing of vehicles as pivotal operations in supply chain management, and last but not least, the economic-environmental category of sustainability has been further noticed by the scholars.

Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an unprecedented crisis for businesses. The small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been impacted even more, due to their limited resources. Extant literature has prescribed many treatments on how SMEs could survive in post COVID-19 situation, but studies did not analyse how big data driven innovation could improve supply chain management (SCM) process in the post COVID-19 pandemic under the moderating influence of SME technology leadership support. Thus, there is a research gap in this important domain. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of big data driven innovation and technology capability of the SME on its supply chain system. The study also investigates the moderating role of SME technology leadership support on SME performance in the post COVID-19 scenario. With the help of literature and resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capability view (DCV) theory, a theoretical model has been developed conceptually. Later the model is validated using structural equation modelling (SEM) technique with 327 usable respondents from SMEs from India. The study found that both big data driven innovation and the techno-functional capability of SME impacts supply chain capability which in turn impacts the SME performance in the post COVID-19 scenario.

Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Due to the environment-friendly attribution and cost-saving potential of remanufacture, many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) commence taking it as part of production strategy. While the inherent uncertainties in closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) add to the difficulty in operational management. As the first case on the coupling effect of multi-uncertainties, the paper carries out analyses of eight critical uncertainties and quantifies the impacts on the whole CLSC. Based on mathematical derivation and followed by numerical experiments, the results demonstrate that by formulating appropriate remanufacture-up-to ratio, OEMs are able to adjust the relationship between supply and demand indirectly, and then strike an optimal balance to maximize the economic benefits under multi-uncertainties.

Biofuels and Biorefining: Volume 2: Intensification Processes and Biorefineries,"Due to the fossil fuel depletion, integrated biorefineries have become a sustainable alternative to satisfy the increasing energy demands. In this way, designing and retrofitting new and existing biorefinery supply chains through mathematical optimization methods can identify different optimal pathways, incorporating environmental, and economic objectives. However, to achieve the system sustainability, it is necessary to consider the environmental-economic-social balance. Therefore, in this chapter, the optimal planning for the electric energy generation through integrated biorefineries is described. The energy demand of the Michoacán State of Mexico was considered as case study, also agricultural residues of the region were taken into consideration for the biorefinery integration performance assessment, in order to evaluate the possibility for the conventional energy transition to the energy contained in crop residues. Hence, a mathematical model is proposed, where there are included all the supply chain interactions; social evaluation is included as well, not only from job generation point of view, but also evaluating how much benefit in human development index is obtained in the State with this energy transition implementation.","Martínez-Guido S.I., García-Trejo J.F., Ponce-Ortega J.M.",Social impact assessment in designing supply chains for biorefineries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137573692&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-12-824117-2.00008-9&partnerID=40&md5=3cb098e612d0424f169e31953b71236a
Annals of Operations Research,"Due to the high necessity of medical face masks and face shields during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare centers dealing with infected patients have faced serious challenges due to the high consumption rate face masks and face shields. In this regard, the supply chain of healthcare centers should put all of their efforts into avoiding any shortages of masks and shields as these products are considered as primary ways to prevent the spread of the virus. Since, any shortages in these products would lead to irrecoverable and costly consequences in terms of the mortality rate of patients and medical staff. Therefore, healthcare centers should decide on best supplier to supply required products, considering technical, and sustainability measures. Dynamicity and uncertainty of the pandemic are other factors that add up to the complexity of the supplier selection problem. Therefore, this paper develops a novel decision-making approach using Measuring attractiveness through a categorical-based evaluation technique (MACBETH) and a new combinative distance-based assessment method to address the supplier selection problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high uncertainty, vague and incomplete information for decision-making problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, the developed decision-making approach is implemented under fuzzy rough numbers as a superior uncertainty set of the traditional fuzzy set and rough numbers. Extensive sensitivity analysis tests are performed based on parameters of the decision-making approach, impacts of weight coefficients, and consistency of results in comparison to other MCDM methods. A real-life case study is investigated for a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey to show the applicability of the developed approach. Based on the results of MACBETH method, job creation and occupational health and safety systems are two top criteria.

Natural Resource Modeling,"Due to the nature of the agricultural and food industry, the management of production, storage, transportation, waste disposal and environmental effects of their production, are of great importance. To deal with the sustainability issues linked to their supply chains, we propose in this study a mathematical model to design a sustainable supply chain of highly perishable agricultural product (strawberry). The model is a multiperiod, multiproduct multiobjective MINLP mathematical program that takes into consideration economic, social and environmental objectives to cover all aspects of sustainability. In addition, a G/M/S/M queuing system is developed for the transportation of harvested products between facilities for the first time. Since real-world problems related to industries such as food and agriculture are inherently uncertain, in this model, the important parameters of the problem are considered uncertain using fuzzy sets theory and a hybrid robust possibilistic programming model is developed. In addition, the Epsilon constraint approach converts the multiobjective mathematical model into a single-objective one and the Lagrangian relaxation method is used to effectively solve the model on a large scale. A case study in Iran is provided to investigate the results and discuss the solutions. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the impacts of important parameters on the solution.

Cleaner Engineering and Technology,"Due to the scarcity of resources, global warming, and rising energy prices, there has been significant growth in research and development in sustainable manufacturing. This has moved the responsibility of manufacturers to manufacture sustainable products in a sustainable manner focusing on product, process and supply chain waste during their life cycle. However, many organizations try to opt for this strategy, but due to price competition, focus on quality issues, and lack of integration of various enablers of sustainable manufacturing, organizations are not able to implement sustainable manufacturing strategically. The purposes (scientific value) of this paper are to (i) identify various enablers for sustainable manufacturing (ii) familiarize industrial professionals and SMEs practitioners with the sustainable manufacturing tools and practices (iii) enhance industrial ecology through sustainability gain (iv) enhance the organizational financial, market, social, environmental performance throughout the whole supply chain of manufacturing and product life cycle, for developing the better place of livelihood for the species and increasing GDP value of the nation (v) identification of associated future research directions.

Industrial Crops and Products,"Due to various environmental problems and social impacts caused by biomass supply chains activities such as climate change, increasing energy demand, energy security, and food crisis, on the one hand, and economic issues such as high costs of biomass supply chains logistics activities, and inefficient production of bioenergy products from low-energy density biomass, on the other hand, modeling and optimization of sustainable biomass supply chains have transitioned to a growing area of research in a recent decade. In this perspective, evaluating three aspects of sustainablity, including economic, environmental, and social sustainability, as the main characteristic to review the literature of supply chain design and planning models has been the subject of several review studies, however, modeling and optimization of sustainable biomass supply chains have not been reviewed and analysed so far. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a taxonomic review of biomass to bio-products supply chains design and planning models that evaluate or optimize economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability. To this aim, a total number of 178 papers published in scientific journals are categorized and analyzed according to a comprehensive classification framework, including sustainability dimensions, decision level, modeling approach, model characteristic, solution approach, uncertainty modeling approach, and data. Some significant factors ignored in the previous studies such as sustainability aspects, transportation modes, by-products, type of biomass feedstocks, international and governmental factors are considered in this review in order to provide a comprehensive vision for the readers.

Energies,"During supply chain redesign processes, many environmental initiatives at facilities and their surrounding regions are affected by the closing, opening, or even broadening of facilities. These initiatives may be about the surplus renewable energies that the facility generates for its re-gion, the renewable energy sources that are available in the area for the facility, or the ecological relationships between facilities and their surrounding regions in general. The implications of these ecological relationships for the supply chain redesign problem were considered in this study in order to minimize the negative outcomes while minimizing the process’s related expenses. Thus, to minimize the unwanted effects, an objective function is defined in addition to the cost objective, which results in a bi-objective problem. Although small cases can be solved by exact methods such as AUGMECON, for larger scales, a matheuristic algorithm needs to be developed. The efficiency of the developed algorithm was investigated through numerical instances as well as with different metrics including a Pareto analysis. The results at larger scales show a shorter runtime of the matheuristic compared to the AUGMECON algorithm.

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"During the new COVID-19 outbreak, companies are looking to sourcing leaders to assist them diversify their supply base and prepare for a number of situations. In recent days, the role of emerging paradigms, including lean, agile, resilient, green, and sustainability (LARGS) in highly competitive supply chains, has been gaining momentum. However, there is no research on the LARGS paradigm for sustainable supplier selection in the literature. The aim of this paper is to identify important criteria for supplier selection in the LARGS paradigm and to develop the hierarchical relationship between the criteria. This research has identified 22 key criteria for supplier selection in the LARGS paradigm. Data were collected from 12 experts and analysed by interpretive structural modeling (ISM). From the ISM model, it is observed that geographic location is placed at the bottom of the hierarchy, showing high driving power and the most important criteria while selecting any supplier. Lead time also indicates high driving power and organizations must focus on the suppliers' lead time to improve product performance and introduce new products faster into the markets. The findings will help the practitioners and policymakers to formulate supply chain robustness and resilience strategies to diminish supply chain risks imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The presented model can be assessed as a strategic tool to select a supplier who considers lean, agile, resilient, green, and sustainable criteria simultaneously to increase supply chain efficiency and effectiveness.

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"During the past few years, the increase of last-mile distribution (LMD) of the business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce has brought changes for the Supply Chain Management (SCM), such as new economic and environmental challenges. On the other hand, sustainability and high levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with transportation of goods have not yet been considered to be sufficient to help address this gap. This work aims to investigate how flexible delivery time strategies may impact the mileage traveled by vehicles in the LMD. To do that, a discrete event simulation model was developed using the consolidation level and delivery time variables to analyze logistics scenarios. Results revealed that, in certain circumstances, more flexible delivery times and higher levels of shipment consolidation may shorten the total mileage traveled by the vehicles.

This paper discusses the outcomes of a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) following the PRISMA guidelines and employs dynamic capabilities theory to suggest that strategic routines and competencies, integrated value chains, sustainability-oriented transformations, and strategic organizational developments are the drivers to effectively develop dynamic capabilities. Similarly, environmental-oriented sustainability, sustainable strategic management, sustainable dynamic capabilities, stakeholdercentric approach, sustainable supply chain management, operational excellence, sustainable research and development (R&D), and sustainability-oriented global business strategy are found to be the drivers to achieve overall corporate sustainability. Based on the findings, a conceptual model is proposed to obtain sustained competitive advantage by developing sustainable dynamic capabilities and achieving corporate sustainability.","Bari N., Chimhundu R., Chan K.-C.",Dynamic Capabilities to Achieve Corporate Sustainability: A Roadmap to Sustained Competitive Advantage,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123516438&doi=10.3390%2fsu14031531&partnerID=40&md5=c60b89f022728181caab8bc1ac1fda39
Journal of Environmental Management,"Eco-efficiency analysis at multi-levels can address the disconnection between its macro-level necessity and micro-level contribution. This cross-level analysis helps policymaking on systematically improving the sustainability of industry. Therefore, in this study, the dual-level eco-efficiency evaluation combing with interactive econometric analysis was applied for contributing a more holistic view of sustainable management in the heavy pollution industry. The empirical study was based on 12 international clothing brands and retailers' textile supply chains and their 202 major upstream manufacturers in China from 2015 to 2019. The dual-level evaluation uncovered a significant improvement in eco-efficiency both at the textile manufacturer and supply chain levels during the five years. The manufacturers' average eco-efficiency increased by 54%. The dyeing and finishing companies' efficiency of emissions to air, energy use, GHG emissions, and water use averagely increased by 165%, 39%, 28%, and 19%, respectively; discharges to water did not change significantly. Meanwhile, the interactive econometric analysis revealed the effects of green management certification, technological innovation, and the number of buyers/suppliers on dual-level eco-efficiency. The influencing mechanism of the same factor on eco-efficiency was demonstrated heterogeneous at manufacturer and supply chain levels. Adopting green management certification was an efficient facilitator to promote textile manufacturers' eco-efficiency, but not sufficient to advance supply chain's ecological performance until 2018. Conversely, inducing technological innovation can promote industry sustainability benefitting from knowledge search and absorption at the supply chain level. Depending on the multi-level lens, this study underlines that the same factor may have heterogeneous impacts at different levels and provides a drawable approach that can support decision-making on improving overall eco-efficiency for stakeholders such as companies, brands and retailers, and the government.","Ruan X., Ding N., Yang J.",Dual-level eco-efficiency analysis in sustainable management: An empirical study on textile manufacturers and supply chains in China,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120878430&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2021.114227&partnerID=40&md5=647de9639c0ec1c566c48317604c2d67
International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Eco-efficiency analysis can provide useful information about sustainability in the tourism industry, which has an important role in both global economy recovery and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), generating considerable indirect carbon emissions with respect to the supply chain due to its significant connections to other industries. This study, from the perspective of tourism sectors, including tourism hotels, travel agencies, and scenic spots, integrated the environmentally extended input–output analysis (EEIO) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) models to develop a research framework, analyzing the indirect carbon emissions of the tourism supply chain, evaluating eco-efficiency with respect to both direct carbon emissions and total carbon emissions (including direct and indirect parts), and exploring the driving factors of eco-efficiency of tourism sectors using Tobit regression models. This study took Gansu as a case, a province in China characterized by higher carbon intensity, an underdeveloped economy, and rapid tourism growth. The results demonstrate that (1) tourism hotels contribute the most carbon emissions in tourism sectors, especially indirectly due to the supply chain, with carbon emissions mainly resulting from the manufacturing of food and tobacco; (2) the eco-efficiency of tourism sectors in Gansu presents a U-shaped curve, which is consistent with Kuznets’ theory; and (3) energy technology is key to improving the eco-efficiency of tourism sectors. The research results provide a clear path for the reduction of carbon emissions and the improvement of eco-efficiency in Gansu tourism sectors.

Journal of Business Research,"Eco-innovation (EI) allows organizations to achieve environmental and economic gains but the conditions for successful EI to occur are unclear. This paper proposes that firms can improve their EI performance by adopting circular economy (CE) systems and technologies, such as product take-back and recycling. We thus explore an unconventional, systems- and technology-driven path dependence dynamic leading to higher EI performance because of prior CE commitments (instead of managerial initiatives directly aimed at fostering EI). An analysis of 724 firms shows that the adoption of such technologies and systems puts firms on a sustainability path: firms benefit from making further changes to improve the functioning of these systems, which in turn create the conditions and capabilities for future EIs. Environmental supply chain policies thus mediate the relationship as the firm adopting take-back and recycling needs to involve outside partners in their administration. Neither environmental management systems nor data protection policies act as mediators. This is the first quantitative study that considers take-back and recycling and EI scores with a cross-national-cross-sectorial sample size. The results indicate that firms should see the introduction of CE systems and technologies as an opportunity for EI.","Wang H., Masi D., Dhamotharan L., Day S., Kumar A., Li T., Singh G.",Unconventional path dependence: How adopting product take-back and recycling systems contributes to future eco-innovations,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122931427&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2021.12.057&partnerID=40&md5=d171cabc7bfbafd051f96b4065e47581
Sustainability (Switzerland),"E-commerce is always more diffused as a selling channel around the whole world market, and its importance has increased and continues to increase with the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. It provides enterprises a lot of opportunities, as the importance of physical stores to sell goods is bypassed. However, it has also changed the role of logistics in the supply chain. For this reason, this work aims to identify the main logistics research areas related to e-commerce implementation and the factors and key performance indicators, which should be taken into account for each logistics research area, with particular attention to sustainable aspects. For doing this, a structured and comprehensive literature analysis is carried out. Keywords associated with e-commerce and logistics areas are matched to identify the most interesting works related to its implementation. From the analysis, five main research areas are identified: Supply Chain Network Design (SCND); Outbound Logistics (OL); Reverse Logistics (RL); Warehousing (WR); and IT and data management (E-IT). For each area, key factors, strategies and performance indicators have been identified. Finally, a methodological framework that summarizes the results of the analysis is presented; this is a useful tool for managers to implement or expand their e-commerce business.

Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"Economic development trends are objective towards globalization and formation of integrated transport and logistics systems that include consumers, production and logistics of supply and distribution. In these conditions, improving the efficiency of logistics is a development vector that should be set by state and international organizations. Logistic operations are energy intensive and have a negative impact on the environment. Costs are not an appropriate metric. Improving energy efficiency in logistics is critical to the sustainability of the economy and can be achieved through rational management of goods and transport flows, efficient use of energy resources and production capacities. Measuring energy efficiency makes it possible to diagnose current situation, identify potential for promotion and develop a strategy aimed at improving the efficiency of logistics. The article proposes a conceptual framework for identifying different system levels in the logistics system, where the potential for improving energy efficiency of integrated transport and logistics systems can be found. The article emphasizes the need for a standardized approach to measuring the energy efficiency of logistics, which allows comparisons between transport systems, and also outlines approaches to the study of indicators for assessing the energy efficiency of an individual voyage of a ship, a shipping company, or assessing the energy efficiency of a supply chain.","Arkhipov A., Maslennikov S.",Energy Efficiency of Integrated Transport and Logistics Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127227449&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-96383-5_102&partnerID=40&md5=5c105acd0a92245bd6a298c02855fe05

This paper sought to understand the extent to which employees’ perceptions influence the practice of sustainable procurement in the context of a developing country where sustainability awareness is low. Drawing on the Diffusion of Innovation theory, procurement officers’ perceptions of sustainable procurement were examined relative to the attributes of complexity, compatibility and relative advantage. Empirical data from 322 Ghanaian organisations were analysed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modelling to determine the nature of procurement officers’ perceptions of sustainable procurement and the effects of the perceptions on relevant organisational practices. The findings indicate that whereas perceptions of relative advantage did not significantly influence the practice of sustainable procurement, perceptions of compatibility had a significant positive effect, and perceptions of complexity had a significant negative effect on sustainable procurement.

Environmental Impact Assessment Review,"Electric mobility is emerging all around the world to minimize environmental impacts, reduce dependency on petroleum, and diversify energy sources for transportation. Any emerging technology comes with uncertainties in terms of its environmental, economic, and social impacts on the global society, and history has shown that some technological changes have led also to great societal transformation thus shaping our future as humanity. Understanding, perceiving, and anticipating the potential changes are essential to managing as well as internalizing maximum benefits out of these technological advancements for a sustainable global community. In the literature, life cycle assessment approaches are mainly used to assess the potential environmental impacts of electric vehicles. Considering the potential impacts of emerging transportation technologies, traditional life cycle assessment is not sufficient to analyze economic and social impacts, ripple, side, or rebound effects, macro-economic impacts, and global-supply chain related impacts. In response to these knowledge gaps, traditional environmental life cycle assessment approaches are evolving into new more integrated, and broader approaches (e.g., life cycle sustainability assessment). This research aims to reveal research gaps in the sustainability assessment of electric vehicles and provide an outlook of the current state of knowledge, perspectives on research gaps, and potential ways for the adoption of integrated life-cycle modeling approaches. We conducted a comprehensive literature review focusing on sustainability assessment studies for emerging electric vehicle technologies for the period between 2009 and 2020 using the Scopus database. A total of 138 life cycle assessment studies focusing on electric and autonomous (electric) vehicles are analyzed. The reviewed studies are classified and analyzed based on sustainability indicators, life cycle approaches, life cycle phases, data sources and regions, and vehicle technology and class. We also compared the global warming potential of battery electric vehicles of different class sizes. According to the literature review, five major knowledge gaps are identified; 1) lack of socio-economic assessment, 2) lack of integrated modeling approaches and macro-level assessment; 3) limited consideration of end-of-life management and circular economy applications, 4) underrepresented developing world; 5) underrepresented emerging technologies.

"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity","Emerging technologies such as electronic procurement have rapidly become common practice in recent years. With the advent of internet technologies and open innovations, the traditional procurement system is transformed into an electronic procurement system. Technology adoption is influenced by multiple factors, including the adopter, technology, and ecosystem in which they function. Considering this, E-procurement is still being adopted slowly. This research aims to investigate the extension of the adoption of E-procurement and identify the relationships between the E-procurement technologies and green procurement practices across different sectors of ISO 14001-certified Malaysian enterprises. This research is supported by the Technology Acceptance Model, one of the significant theories of technology adoption. Using SPSS and SmartPLS, the survey data is analyzed quantitatively. The structural model explains 86% of the variance in green procurement and shows the positive significant relationship between green procurement and the E-procurement technology of the ISO 14001 firms. Consequently, adopting E-procurement technology would benefit company sustainability.

International Journal of Sustainable Engineering,"Emergy Accounting (EMA) has gained attention in recent times as an environmental accounting tool. So far, it has been used for analysis at national and regional levels; however, the EMA has not been utilised in a business performance analysis context. When used in a business context, EMA reveals the interface between industrial activity and the environment. EMA analysis can provide opportunities in measuring the social, economic, and environmental performance of the industry in a sustainability context. Unlike other evaluation methods, which are ‘demand-side’ or ‘user-side’ concerned, EMA analysis is a ‘donor-side’ approach. This research work illustrates the selection of suppliers based on the amount of emergy consumption. Emergy indicators, such as Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR), Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI), Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR), Emergy Self-support Ratio (ESR), Renewability percent (%R), Emergy flow Density (ED), and Emergy Investment Ratio (EIR) are estimated. The results show that there is enough room for improving emergy performance in the tannery industry.

Journal of Environmental Management,"Energy generation from waste renewable sources represent an efficient way to provide green power with the highest environmental benefits, tackling problems related to the high costs for their disposal through the conversion of these wastes in biofuels. However, several challenges hinder their intensified use, as the huge variability in the amount and composition of these sources forces authors to enlarge their studies on the entire biomass-to-energy chain sustainability where the power technology can be installed with the highest profits. In present work, the technical, environmental and economic impact of the entire biomass-to-energy supply chain is assessed with reference to a real commercially available Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system, the CMD ECO20X based on biomass gasification, installed as operational demonstration in the Municipality of Laurino in the National Park of Cilento, Vallo di Diano, and Alburni (PNCVD) in Southern part of Italy. Several calculation tools previously developed by authors for the analysis of the performance of the various components of the ECO20X system are here employed to define the mass and energy fluxes that characterize its operations in a local supply chain where forest management residues (oak and beech trees) and olive pomace from oil mills in the area are exploited. The analysis aims to quantify the energy absorption necessary for the pretreatment operations of the organic residue (shredding, briquetting, drying) which are essential for gasification, and how much they affect the production deriving from the biomass cogeneration process itself. Then, measurements in terms of pollutants related to the energy production at the municipality and of the air quality in the area, help in the evaluation of the plant environmental impact from a global perspective, by virtue of data obtained from an LCA analysis conducted considering one year functioning of the CHP plant.","Costa M., Piazzullo D., Di Battista D., De Vita A.",Sustainability assessment of the whole biomass-to-energy chain of a combined heat and power plant based on biomass gasification: biomass supply chain management and life cycle assessment,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131684378&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.115434&partnerID=40&md5=dea5f3a996cb577e7057524fa2f09dfc
Procedia CIRP,"Energy generation refers to a process through which energy (in two forms of heat and electricity) is extracted from waste wood. Apart from all benefits it has to human beings; this process is associated with some problems such as air pollution and high transportation cost. The logistic costs of collecting and transporting waste wood cause considerable challenges regarding scale, geography of supplier location, sustainability of supply chain, etc. Given these research challenges, this work contributes to the existing literature by developing an integrated Geographical Information System (GIS) and Agent-based simulation modeling to assess the effect of intermodal transportation (truck and train) technology developments (capacity and size) of the woody biomass supply chain (BSC) on the environmental emissions and cost. This work aims at analyzing and quantifying the environmental emissions and economic cost of woody waste BSC transportation design. The developed model is tested on the case study in Victoria-Australia. Results showed that a combination of truck and train transport with increasing size and capacity of container leads to decreasing near 60% gaseous pollutant emissions. Changing the capacity of the containers from light to medium and heavy would lead to reducing the cumulative emissions by an averagely of 46% and 59%, respectively. Finally, the sensitivity analysis results revealed that using 100% truck transportation leads to the highest emission cost for BSC.

Energy,"Energy, water, and land (EWL) are typical elements in urban food-energy-water systems. With the expansive growth of urbanization and the economy, the demands for EWL keep increasing and pose significant challenges to urban sustainability. Previous studies mostly focused on one or two elements flows through sectoral approaches while ignoring the interconnectedness of food-energy-water subsystems and the complexity of an open urban system. Here, we adopted a nexus view to track the urban EWL flows not only within local but also across regional, national, and even global supply chains from the production- and consumption-based perspectives using the environmentally extended multiscale input-output model (EE-MSIO). The four Chinese municipalities (i.e., Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), also known as megacities, were selected as our cases. Our results revealed that all four megacities were consumption-oriented cities for EWL resources. Nearly 72%–77%, 87%–92%, and 95%–99% of the consumption-based energy, water, and land flows were sourced from outside the geographical boundaries of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, respectively.

Journal of Function Spaces,"Enhancing competitive pressure is one of the most significant roles of supply chain management. The competitive environment and customer perception have shifted in favour of an ecological mentality. As a result, green supplier selection (GSS) has emerged as a critical problem. The challenge of green supplier selection striving for agility, durability, ecological sensitivity, leanness, and sustainability is tackled in this paper. In terms of recycling applications, environmental applications, carbon footprint, and water consumption, the environmental parameters evaluated in GSS and traditional supplier selection differ. Because of the form of the problem, a resolution is defined, which comprises an algorithm entrenched in the spherical linear Diophantine fuzzy sets (SLDFSs) Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique. Before discussing the approach of the SLDF model, some background information on SLDF sets is provided. To assure the uniqueness of this robust extension, different operations on SLDFSs are described, along with some concise interpretations to help the reader comprehend these ideas. A robust TOPSIS approach has been utilized in the issue of GSS by taking into consideration the multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) technique particularly useful in several areas, like analyzing and choosing traditional and environmental conventionalities. Due to linguistic criteria and the inability to assess all criteria, the fuzzy technique must be used with the TOPSIS method to lessen the consequences of instability and ambiguity. The spherical linear Diophantine fuzzy TOPSIS approach is employed, as it simplifies the evaluation of decision-makers and criteria. The hybrid technique resulting from integrating the SLDFS and TOPSIS is extremely successful in selecting which provider is more suited among the alternatives established on the criteria set by the order of significance, and this method may also be incorporated into similar issues.","Alshammari I., Parimala M., Ozel C., Riaz M.",Spherical Linear Diophantine Fuzzy TOPSIS Algorithm for Green Supply Chain Management System,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135922318&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f3136462&partnerID=40&md5=bdc1bacc382ab7537f12964964f59a94
Polymers,"Enhancing the biochemical supply chain towards sustainable development requires more efforts to boost technology innovation at early design phases and avoid delays in industrial biotechnology growth. Such a transformation requires a comprehensive step-wise procedure to guide bioprocess development from laboratory protocols to commercialization. This study introduces a process design framework to guide research and development (R&D) through this journey, bearing in mind the particular challenges of bioprocess modeling. The method combines sustainability assessment and process optimization based on process efficiency indicators, technical indicators, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and process optimization via Water Regeneration Networks (WRN). Since many bioprocesses remain at low Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), the process simulation module was examined in detail to account for uncertainties, providing strategies for successful guidance. The sus-tainability assessment was performed using the geometric mean-based sustainability footprint metric. A case study based on Chitosan production from shrimp exoskeletons was evaluated to demonstrate the method’s applicability and its advantages in product optimization.

Sustainable Cities and Society,"Ensuring food security, improving sustainability, and, at the same time, demonstrating the widely perceived economic value are challenges presented by commercial urban agriculture. This article explores the economic, social, and environmental factors that contribute to commercial urban agriculture as a response to sustainable development. Therefore, using text mining, a scientific survey of information was carried out to verify the predominant approaches in the literature. The economic causes are the main drivers of the activity, especially when related to the generation of employment and income, minimization of costs along the supply chain, and the proximity of the local market to the consumer. Investigations on environmental sustainability have shown significant growth in recent years, as commercial urban agriculture contributes to changes in the interactions of the urban environment, especially for land use, ecosystem conservation, biodiversity, climate improvement, and urban landscape. There is also evidence of a positive outlook on the future of urban agriculture characterized as an indispensable activity for the local production of sustainable food, which tends to minimize the pressures on conventional agriculture and contribute to facing global challenges.","Alves D.D.O., de Oliveira L.",Commercial urban agriculture: A review for sustainable development,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138483795&doi=10.1016%2fj.scs.2022.104185&partnerID=40&md5=7950ce5e4d007b8f3c94c7c07ef3ee0d
Chemical Engineering Research and Design,"Ensuring pharmaceutical products’ availability and accessibility in a sustainable way is one of the main current challenges of pharmaceutical supply chains. This work explores this challenge and focuses on the development of a decision support tool for planning of an equitable and sustainable distribution of medicines. Equitable access is defined based on the burden of diseases of the different markets, making use of a DALY-based metric (Disability-Adjusted Life Year). Moreover, a minimum level of pharmaceutical product availability is imposed across the different geographical areas. Economic and environmental sustainability are incorporated in the decision support tool as goals measured through Net Present Value (NPV) and the environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, respectively. The tool is based on a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which integrates strategical-tactical supply chain decisions. The model is applied to a representative case study of Meningococcal meningitis’ vaccine supply chain where vaccines production and distribution are considered. Several scenarios are studied and the effect of decisions on supply chain goals are analyzed. Environmental, economic, and social hotspots are identified. In particular, product’ accessibility is explored allowing the identification of strategies to better design and plan a pharmaceutical supply chain, to improve products access in a sustainable form.","Duarte I., Mota B., Pinto-Varela T., Barbosa-Póvoa A.P.",Pharmaceutical industry supply chains: How to sustainably improve access to vaccines?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129490299&doi=10.1016%2fj.cherd.2022.04.001&partnerID=40&md5=f5bb5b44af28216de649429e876b5f13
"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Environmental deterioration and global warming has created a substantial impact on international companies to incorporate eco-friendly, green supply chain practices and remain competitive in the market. In food supply chain, the selection of the best supply chain management (SCM) strategy can improve the overall performance and can be crucial in managing the food supply chain challenges and achieving sustainable food supply chain. In this paper, different green SCM strategies were explored and evaluated for food supply chain using combinative distance-based assessment method under interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy information as interval extension of q-rung orthopair fuzzy can effectively handle the ambiguity and uncertainty of preference given by experts in decision making. A generalized p-distance between two interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers is proposed in the current study and is used to formulate interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamming distance and interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy Euclid distance. Five supply chain strategies, namely risk-based, efficiency-based, resource-based, innovation-based, and closed-loop strategy, are evaluated to select best strategy for food supply chain based on different attributes such as green manufacturing, green design and development, green management system, green procurement, and green marketing which contribute toward sustainability. It is found that closed-loop supply chain strategy is the best strategy for food supply chain to attain sustainability.

In order to reduce the adverse impacts and achieve sustainability in agricultural supply chain, it's necessary to scientifically explore composite indicators interlinked with agricultural sustainable supply chain management (ASSCM). The current study developed an integrated rough-fuzzy WINGS-ISM method to reveal the hierarchal and causal structure of indicators. It is found that environmental legislation, regulation, licensing, and government subsidies are the main drivers of ASSCM. Specifically, the government can guide the sustainable development of ASSCM by regulating the business environment. The financial support needs to be enlarged to optimize the structure in science and technology of ASSCM. Moreover, corporates and organizations are highly motivated by the increasing awareness of social responsibility and sustainability consciousness to improve the economic performance and achieve the ASSCM goals.

Earth System Governance,"Environmental governance is increasingly challenged by global flows, which connect distant places through trade, investment and movement of people. To date, research on this topic has been dispersed across multiple fields and diverse theoretical perspectives. We present the results of a systematic literature review of 120 journal articles on the environmental governance of global flows and their environmental impacts, employing the notion of telecoupling as a common analytical lens. Six themes emerged, which can guide a comparative and policy-relevant research agenda on governing global telecoupling: (1) advancement of problem-centered research (as opposed to studying existing governance arrangements), (2) displacement of environmental burdens from Global North to South from a telecoupling perspective, (3) environmental governance of telecoupling between Global South countries, (4) policy coherence in governing global flows, (5) cross-scalar interactions between private and public governance and (6) combinations of governance arrangements to effectively address environmental problems in telecoupled settings.","Cotta B., Coenen J., Challies E., Newig J., Lenschow A., Schilling-Vacaflor A.",Environmental governance in globally telecoupled systems: Mapping the terrain towards an integrated research agenda,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131718176&doi=10.1016%2fj.esg.2022.100142&partnerID=40&md5=10c0395808f9be5be831db70fc586806

Reusing/remanufacturing economically viable used products, collected from end customers, has become an integral part of many supply chain operations. Remanufacturing with green investment plays an essential role in sustainable supply chain management by utilizing an environment-friendly approach. Considering this environmental, social, and economic development of society, this model mainly focuses on the flexibility of production rate under the multi-retailer based supply chain to satisfy customer's demand. In this study, the manufacturer produces final products from new raw materials and used collected products. Subsequently, the products are transported to retailers and sold along with their service facilities. A mathematical model of this flexible manufacturing–remanufacturing system is developed to improve the service and to maintain sustainability always. The global optimization is established theoretically and a proposition is developed. Through numerical experiments, the global optimality is also verified. Some special cases, along with a comparison graph, are also provided for the validation of this results. The obtained results indicate that the concerned idea of service facility helps the customer to choose products without hesitation and the supply chain management achieves the maximum profit under green investment.

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Environmental sustainability is becoming a leading indicator for evaluating supply chain management. This study considers two players, a manufacturer and a retailer, that offer substitutable products and compete in green and price-sensitive markets. This article studies members’ decisions regarding pricing competition and cooperation (marketing cost sharing) for green products in a vertical supply chain. Furthermore, it investigates the effects of their decisions to obtain an optimal profit on the green products supply chain using the Stackelberg game theory approach under competition. This article studies several new green products structures within a supply chain and researches their environmental performance impact. Environmental responsibilities are explored in a supply chain that consumers are informed about eco-friendly products. The manufacturer decides the wholesale of its products, designing and producing a new green product to maximize its expected profit. The retailer chooses the retail price and amount of effort for green marketing of the products to maximize its expected profit. The results show that cooperation may not always be to the benefit of all partners; therefore, the best strategy for all partners is when an association is not applied. According to the research results, the retailer tends to produce and sell greener products (higher greenness) to maximize profits. At the same time, the manufacturer has to spend more cost to make greener products. The main influential factor for choosing the type of production of green products is market size. If the market size is more than predicted, the best choice for the production of green products is development-intensive green products; conversely, if the market potential is low, marginal cost-intensive green products are the best choice.","Fadavi A., Jolai F., Taleizadeh A.A.",Green product design in a supply chain with considering marketing under competition and coordination,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118593469&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-021-01917-9&partnerID=40&md5=1039c4886c4a779c9e3b0a5c2a9b8c67
Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Environmental sustainability issues have become an increasing concern for enterprises and organizations due to new tendencies in climate change. Green supply chain management (GSCM) practices are growing worldwide in this context. Based on socio-technical systems and institutional theory, the present study develops a conceptual model highlighting a mediating effect between two distinct categories of GSCM dimensions, i.e., technical practices and behavioral practices, along with the moderating effect of institutional pressure on organizational performance. Data were collected from 260 Pakistani manufacturers, and the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was employed to analyze the hypotheses. The classification of technical and behavioral GSCM practices and findings of this research contributes to the literature on GSCM. Empirical results reveal that behavioral practices of GSCM (top management support, supplier, and customer involvement) mediate the relationship between technical GSCM practices (eco-design, green manufacturing, and reverse logistics) and organizational performance (economic, environmental, and social). The results also demonstrate that institutional pressure positively moderates the relationship between technical practices and organizational performance.

Soft Computing,"Environmentally conscious supplier selection has become increasingly important in recent years. Green supplier selection is one of the vital decisions of supply chain management, as it is preferred for businesses in the market that adopt an environmental approach and green philosophy in line with material and moral benefits. In this context, the problem of choosing the most efficient green supplier is addressed with a three-step methodology using big data analytics that includes an integrated approach and hybrid fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS techniques. First of all, big data plays an important role in delivering meaningful results by reducing complexity to a more fundamental level. It is possible to obtain more consistent results by examining a series of criteria in green supplier selection at a more reasonable and operational level. Thus, the role of big data analytics provides an input for decision-making, which enables a systematic reduction to more concise data. Then, these inputs are evaluated in a fuzzy environment with hybrid MCDM techniques and the most efficient green supplier is determined among the suppliers.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Establishing a circular supply chain for single-use medical devices would make a significant contribution to reduce health care-generated emissions. One way in which this can be accomplished is to apply the possibility of device recovery through high-level disinfection and sterilization (a process referred to as ‘reprocessing’). As increasing emphasis is being placed on reducing health care-generated emissions, several major OEMs of single-use medical devices have extended their business to reprocessing services, taking a green servitization orientation. The present paper examines the trend towards green servitization in the single-use medical device industry. It uses interviews with industry experts, complemented with information from secondary sources, to explore how the green servitization phenomenon is supporting the transition of the industry to a more sustainable economic model. The findings provide insights into the green servitization endeavors of device OEMs as regards services offered, strategic intents, dominant business models, use of collaborative relationships and capability requirements.

Food Research International,"European food production systems have become very efficient in terms of high yield, quality and safety. However, these production systems are not sustainable since, amongst other reasons, a significant proportion of the production is wasted or lost in the supply chain. One of the strategies of the European Union is to achieve climate neutrality by moving towards a circular economy with better waste management. This includes, reducing food waste and losses, and reusing or recycling by-products of the food and feed production systems. A circular economy would greatly improve the sustainability of the European food systems, but attention must be paid to the emergence of (new) food safety hazards. New or not well-known hazards can occur because by-products are reintroduced into the system or new processing steps are used for recycling, and/or known hazards can accumulate in the food production chain due to the reuse of (by-)products. This review addresses food safety hazards in the circular biobased economy, covering the domains of plant production, animal production, aquaculture, and packaging. Instead of an exhaustive list of all potential hazards, example cases of circular food production systems are given, highlighting the known and potential emerging food safety hazards. Current literature covering emerging food safety hazards in the circular economy shows to be limited. Therefore, more research is needed to identify food safety hazards, to measure the accumulation and the distribution of such hazards in the food and feed production systems, and to develop control and mitigation strategies.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"Even though global supply chains are (usually unintentionally) tied to slave labor, research and practice have largely ignored the issue. This is expected to change as civil society activism and new legislation increase the risk of litigation and reputational damage to supply chain partners. To deal with and combat modern slavery in the supply chain, a theory inspired social supply chain management framework consisting of indicators and countermeasures of modern slavery in the supply chain is developed. The framework is refined in a qualitative expert interview study. The theoretical framework is then evaluated by a multimethod empirical analysis that includes a multicase study based on publicly available supply chain data from 6000 media articles and company websites as well as a quantitative empirical study based on survey data from 280 corporate sustainability experts operating in global supply networks. The results show that economic, political-legal, social, and environmental factors have a significant impact on contemporary slavery in the supply chain.

This review provides a systematic overview of health metrics and methods to combine health and environmental assessment of foods and diets. Key methodological considerations of importance for best practices are highlighted as well as trends over the past decade, and future research needs. A systematic literature review was performed in the databases Scopus, Dimensions and Pub Med. Eligible articles combined health impact and environmental assessment of food and were published in peer-reviewed scientific journals between 2010 and 2020. Differences in method choices were highlighted based on study approach, dietary baseline data, dietary exposure, dietary-related health outcome, method for health assessment, choice of health metric, environmental outcome and method for combined health and environmental assessment. A total of 33 articles using nine different health metrics in combination with environmental assessment of foods were identified. Avoided, averted, delayed or preventable deaths or cases, followed by disability- or quality-adjusted life years, and hazard ratio were the health metrics most commonly used. Three principal methods to combine health and environmental assessment of foods and diets were identified; parallel assessment (n = 26), scaled assessment (n = 7) and integrated assessment (n = 1).

These include the use of conflict minerals, toxicity, and finite availability or supply chain governance risks of rare earth elements, cobalt, and lithium, that need to be taken into consideration. “Conflict minerals” refer to tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, and their current mining is frequently linked to human rights violations and the financing of violent conflicts. This article focuses on one conflict mineral used in solar panels, tin, the three rare earth elements praseodymium, dysprosium and neodymium, mainly used in permanent magnets that are employed in wind turbines and electric motors in electric vehicles, and lithium and cobalt, as they are needed in lithium-ion batteries for solar and wind energy technologies, and electric vehicles. Focusing on these we identify unfavorable implications of using these elements, including issues of lacking transparency and human rights violations, toxicity and finite availability. Alleviating measures are reviewed for their past contributions as well as their future potential to reduce supply chain risks. These include analyzing the supply chain according to ethical standards, extending regulations beyond the scope of conflict minerals, looking for possible minerals or component substitutes, somewhat diverse across these fields, and increasing the minerals’ recycling rates.","Huber S.T., Steininger K.",Critical sustainability issues in the production of wind and solar electricity generation as well as storage facilities and possible solutions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123837202&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.130720&partnerID=40&md5=81aeda1dc077a7a137968e8f581c87ba
British Journal of Management,"Extending the notion that reshoring can have a significant impact on a firm's supply network owing to the associated location decisions, we explore how reshoring influences the resilience and sustainability of a focal firm's supply network. While reshoring is triggered by aspects related to both the home (domestic) and the host (foreign) country, frequently more favourable aspects in the home country lead to the reshoring decision. To investigate these dynamics, we construct two large-scale networks consisting of 2066 and 1283 firms, respectively, capturing the supply networks of Apple and Jaguar Land Rover. Both networks have been experiencing the reshoring of previously foreign suppliers to domestic locations. Our investigation captures the network dynamics created by this relocation of tier 1 suppliers for the overall supply chain network, that is, also for higher-tier/sub-tier suppliers. The results reveal, contrary to our expectations, that indirect (sub-tier) foreign suppliers positively influence the network's resilience, with this impact, however, being negatively moderated by their degree centrality, that is, the number of ties a node possesses. In addition, existing indirect (sub-tier) domestic suppliers do not have a significant influence on the resilience of the network. No evidence was found for the impact of reshoring on sustainability. Overall, our study contributes to the reshoring literature by delineating its influence on both the resilience and the sustainability of a focal firm's supply chain network.

Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,"Extensive and semi-extensive production based on local swine breeds such as Majorcan Black Pig, Cinta Senese, Gascon, Krškopolje and Turopolje is becoming extremely rare and on the verge of disappearing in Europe. In this context, the main aim of this study was to assess the potential feasibility of marketing strategies to act as guidelines for stakeholders along the supply chain to create and improve added value and match market demands. The sustainability of five production systems was evaluated together with 60 stakeholders representing five local swine breeds, using a World Café (WC) method combined with an Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The results showed that the proposed strategies could differ slightly depending on each system, while the product strategy was a common marketing priority for most of the stakeholders and represented all the systems evaluated. Diversifying production toward quality, innovative products, enhanced standardization, and quality labeling or seals of guarantee, such as the protected geographical indication or the protected designation of origin, would contribute to the sustainability of these chains. Advertising the storytelling of the meat products and emphasizing their healthier properties were also considered as positive strategies. To this effect, promotion should involve improving knowledge of the local systems and raising the profile of the meat products via public relations (networks, web pages, food and gastronomic events, workshops and so on) in the Hotels, Restaurants and Catering (HORECA) sector, stores selling top-quality products and local food shops. Better showcasing of these products and keeping the price in the premium segment would indirectly help the primary sector. By way of conclusion, other more developed local swine systems could be strong competitors, hence it is extremely important to effectively identify and trace all autochthonous swine breed products throughout the production chain. Furthermore, the entire chain must place greater emphasis on grazing (extensive or semi-extensive), the origin of the swine and their meat products. However, of utmost importance is cooperation between farms, firms and institutions.","Rivera-Toapanta E., Kallas Z., Čandek-Potokar M., Gonzalez J., Gil M., Varela E., Faure J., Cerjak M., Urška T., Aquilani C., Lebret B., Karolyi D., Pugliese C., Gil J.M.",Marketing strategies to self-sustainability of autochthonous swine breeds from different EU regions: a mixed approach using the World Café technique and the Analytical Hierarchy Process,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128690985&doi=10.1017%2fS1742170521000363&partnerID=40&md5=aa5c9f43a6adbe526327c9ce444bf7d8
Asia Pacific Journal of Management,"Fashion firms have transferred their manufacturing processes to Asia, seeking minimum labor costs, supported by the academic literature’s proposals for alternative supply chain configurations to maximize profits. Fashion industry has undergone public analysis, facing demands for greater transparency about environmental and social sustainability. The growing public awareness of sustainability issues has led firms to declare their commitment to sustainable resources, but few changes have been registered. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe listed technological innovation as a key tool for making the fashion industry transparent and traceable regarding sustainability and circularity. The research and responsible innovation framework indicate appropriate ways to manage innovation from a responsible and ethical perspective, according to ethical corporate behaviour (ECB), particularly in the industries characterized by productive phases processed in more countries, such as the fashion industry. However, the linkages between responsible innovation, ECB towards innovative and sustainable business models, and their conceptualization, are still unclear in the fashion industry, achieving the goals included in the UN 2030 Agenda. This study draws on bibliometric analysis and systematic review of the literature on 114 articles published between 1990 and 2021 allows to identify the above issues in the research domains, and outline the evolutionary trajectories, as well as to explore the literary corpus about responsible innovation (RI) in the ethical corporate behaviour (ECB) of the fashion industry and its Asian suppliers. The results highlight that fashion brands strive to develop RI and ECB along their supply chain. Still, the misalignment of corporate ethics and cultural values represents a significant obstacle to the adoption of business models, especially to achieve the goals of UN 2030 Agenda. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that discusses RI as enabling driver in the ECB for fashion companies also defining a future research agenda including RI, ECB, iSBMs towards SDGs.","Di Vaio A., Hassan R., D’Amore G., Tiscini R.",Responsible innovation and ethical corporate behavior in the Asian fashion industry: A systematic literature review and avenues ahead,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136906762&doi=10.1007%2fs10490-022-09844-7&partnerID=40&md5=e545bc4dbcb6850ba847b136dc9e0bc6
Decision Support Systems,"Fashion is a global, multi-trillion dollar industry devoted to producing and selling clothing, footwear, and accessories to individuals or groups of people. Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda. Research on the theme is relevant and urgent for the fashion business, which is still in its infancy. Work on the agenda topics could benefit distinct fashion stakeholders, not just customers, and produce well-grounded decision-making in varied FRSC contexts and dynamics.","Pereira A.M., Moura J.A.B., Costa E.D.B., Vieira T., Landim A.R.D.B., Bazaki E., Wanick V.",Customer models for artificial intelligence-based decision support in fashion online retail supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129897941&doi=10.1016%2fj.dss.2022.113795&partnerID=40&md5=9ae281b24ea24d5d7672ac82728f25b8
International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications,"Fashion supply chains are characterised by pressure for low cost and short lead times and face increasing requirements for social and environmental compliance. Hence, fashion retailers have recognised a greater need for collaborating with competitors in upstream supply chain activities, despite competing against each other downstream in the marketplace. This notion of ‘coopetitive’ relationships, a nascent research area, motivated this paper’s case study of six UK-headquartered fashion companies to explore how and why they engage in areas of coopetition interaction and their management of inherent tensions in these relations. Capacity sharing, communication and information sharing, and building relationships/partnerships emerged as motives. The companies exhibited a processual approach to coopetition against a challenging landscape of institutional tensions, which included retailer pressure and organisational structures. Despite risks of opportunism, coopetition was found to be a useful strategy and highly influential for competitive advantage and sustainability in this volatile and dynamic industry sector.","Rafi-Ul-Shan P.M., Grant D.B., Perry P.",Are fashion supply chains capable of coopetition?

Agriculture (Switzerland),"Feeding a growing global population requires improving agricultural production in the face of multidimensional challenges; and digital agriculture is increasingly seen as a strategy for better decision making. Agriculture and agricultural supply chains are increasingly reliant on data, including its access and provision from the farm to the consumer. Far-reaching data provision inevitably needs the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) that offer data originators and depository custodians with a set of guidelines to safeguard a progressive data availability and reusability. Through a systematic literature review it is apparent that although FAIR data principles can play a key role in achieving sustainable agricultural operational and business performance, there are few published studies on how they have been adopted and used. The investigation examines: (1) how FAIR data assimilate with the sustainability framework; and (2) whether the use of FAIR data by the agriculture industry, has an impact on agricultural performance. The work identifies a social science research gap and suggests a method to guide agriculture practitioners in identifying the specific barriers in making their data FAIR. By troubleshooting the barriers, the value propositions of adopting FAIR data in agriculture can be better understood and addressed.","Ali B., Dahlhaus P.",The Role of FAIR Data towards Sustainable Agricultural Performance: A Systematic Literature Review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125557303&doi=10.3390%2fagriculture12020309&partnerID=40&md5=492c48140a0f23256370d1dfab73cd80
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Fertilization of crops used as feed in the dairy industry represents up to 50% of greenhouse gases (GHG) and 30% of milk production costs. The environmental impacts raised from this activity are mainly associated with fertilizer manufacturing. Proper fertilizer selection for feed production is an alternative to improve the dairy industry's sustainability. This study proposes a strategy to mitigate the environmental and economic impacts in the dairy industry via optimization of crop fertilizer blends by using a parametric linear programming model. Individual fertilizers' environmental impacts and costs were evaluated through the ecoinvent database v. 3.3. and governmental information, respectively. The effect of the optimized fertilizer blends used in each crop on the life cycle of a dairy supply chain in the Mexican Bajio region was evaluated. Three analysis tiers were considered: livestock feed production, dairy cattle diet, and dairy farming system. The optimization results of fertilizer blends revealed an opposite behavior between the environmental and cost indicators for all crops; a reduction of 1% in the environmental impacts could increase the fertilization cost by 5.5%. In addition, the results indicated that with the use of optimized fertilizer blends, a reduction of GHG emissions up to 22 g CO2 eq kg−1 of milk could be achieved compared with those conventional ones. Focused on the Mexican Bajio region, this contribution implies up to 2.2% of Mexico's commitments in the COP21 agreement for the livestock sector. Our results show that potential savings in costs of 29.6 MUSD y−1 could be reached when the most economical fertilizer blends are used in the optimization. This work presents an alternative to improve the sustainability in the dairy sector, which could be easily implemented for the agricultural producers, especially in countries such as Mexico, where government budgets dedicated to mitigating environmental impacts are limited.","Quintero-Herrera S., Zwolinski P., Evrard D., Cano-Gómez J.J., Botello-Álvarez J.E., Rivas-García P.",The role of livestock feed fertilization as an improvement of sustainability in the dairy sector,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126581418&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.03.014&partnerID=40&md5=858755db01ce38f926f5bb9af10ba509
Food Frontiers,"Finding a food system to feed the growing worldwide population remains a challenge, especially in the current era, where natural resources are being dramatically depleted. From a historical point of view, the Green Revolution, together with biofortification and sustainable intensification, was established as a possible solution to counter hunger and malnutrition during the second half of the 20th century. As a solution, to overcome the limitations attributed to the Green Revolution, food supply chains were developed. The current food system, based on the long food supply chain (LFSC), is characterized by globalization, promoting several advantages for both producers and consumers. However, LFSC has been demonstrated to be unable to feed the global population and, furthermore, it generates negative ecological, environmental, logistical, and nutritional pressures. Thus, novel efficient food systems are required to respond to current environmental and consumers’ demands, as is the case of short food supply chain (SFSC). As a recently emerging food system, the evaluation of SFSC sustainability in terms of environmental, economic, and social assessment is yet to be determined. This review is focused on the evolution of food supply systems, starting from the Green Revolution to food supply chains, providing a significant perspective on sustainability.","Soria-Lopez A., Garcia-Perez P., Carpena M., Garcia-Oliveira P., Otero P., Fraga-Corral M., Cao H., Prieto M.A., Simal-Gandara J.",Challenges for future food systems: From the Green Revolution to food supply chains with a special focus on sustainability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137194442&doi=10.1002%2ffft2.173&partnerID=40&md5=b122f9b57568b1f8516849caf8cf61eb
Business Strategy and the Environment,"Firm orientation is a key factor in the implementation of sustainability in supply chains (SCs). Although firms recognize the need to define strategies for success, they often overlook whatever strategies they do develop in their decision-making process. To address this gap, we argue that the strategy tripod comprising the industry-based view (IBV), resource-based view (RBV), and institutional-based view (INSBV) can influence SC orientation toward sustainability. This paper describes an investigation into this strategy tripod's impact on the cashew industry's SC sustainability orientation. Multiple case studies were conducted by gathering data from various cashew SC stakeholders. A deductive content analysis showed that, despite the existing influences from the three legs of the strategy tripod, emphasis was placed on the firm perspective (i.e., RBV), which affected SC sustainability orientation in that the industry- (i.e., IBV) and institutional- (i.e., INSBV) level views received less consideration in the creation of SC strategies. This research contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on under-explored relations between business strategy and SC sustainability. Our results show that firms should move from pressure responsiveness to strategy management to implement sustainability-oriented initiatives.","Ponte R.C.D.V., Viana F.L.E., Silva M.E.",Diving into the business strategy: The strategy tripod's influence on supply chain sustainability orientation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136454375&doi=10.1002%2fbse.3241&partnerID=40&md5=f0311f5a4ff91cf56cbc61caf28db26c
Organization and Environment,"Firms are increasingly held accountable for their suppliers’ environmental misconduct and often face significant stakeholder pressure to respond or even end their affiliations with misbehaving suppliers. Despite the importance of the subject, we know little about antecedents to supplier exclusion. In this article, we build on the assumption of stakeholder expectations being a core mechanism—and adopt an expectancy-violation theory lens. Drawing also on complementary insights into signaling theory, we argue that the severity of the misconduct affects the decision to cut ties. Furthermore, we argue that the engagement in environmental partnerships of client firms as well as suppliers moderates this relationship. To test our hypotheses, we use a unique sample of 434 client firm–supplier dyads, including 27 focal firms pressured by Greenpeace to remove “dirty” palm oil suppliers, accused of illegal deforestation.

3rd Generation Biofuels: Disruptive Technologies to Enable Commercial Production,"First-generation corn-based biofuels triggered the “food vs fuel” debate. The diversion of grains to produce bioenergy crops was blamed for the 2007–08 global food crisis. While biofuels are segregated into three generations: first, second, and third, the first-generation biofuels were considered to have an unintended impact on food security, causing a supply constraint of food crops and a spike in the food prices. Even though second-generation biofuels do not directly compete with the food crop as they are derived from lignocellulosic energy crops, significant diversion of agricultural land to grow such crops may trigger another global food crisis and push the developing countries toward food insecurity. However, unlike first- and second-generation biofuels, the third-generation biofuels are obtained from aquatic algal biomass, which does not directly compete for land with other food crops. Consequently, the third-generation biofuel can be a solution to the “food vs fuel” dilemma. The algal biomass has significantly higher yields than the first- and second-generation biofuels with the capacity to grow throughout the year, high tolerance to higher carbon dioxide content, and a low water consumption rate. It neither requires pesticides nor fertilizers. Therefore, once such biofuels are commercially available, it is anticipated that they will substantially contribute to global food security by not causing any additional burden to the world’s food supply chain. The third-generation biofuels are produced from aquatic feedstocks such as algae, which have resilience capacities to survive adverse conditions. While brackish water and coastal seawater, sewage, and wastewater require adequate treatments for further uses, growing algae on such water bodies can be a win-win situation, as the production of such feedstocks will not compete with the existing land use. Traditionally, algae are grown in large ponds followed by harvest, dewatering, and crushed to extract algal oils, converted either through transesterification or by hydrotreating into biofuels. Since the hiatus between demand and supply is not created due to algal-based biofuel production, there will not be any upward pressure on food crops’ prices. Consequently, increasing third-generation biofuels will remain unhindered in the food supply and will not create any global food grains shortage. The production of algal-based feedstock for third-generation biofuels will be similar to the existing aquaculture industry. It will create rural employment at algae-raising facilities and biorefineries, rendering an increase in labor demand and wages. The third-generation biofuels once developed due to their high photosynthetic efficiency, areal productivity, and more efficient uptake of nutrients than currently existing crop-based feedstocks which require land, has the potential to completely substitute the petroleum-based fossil fuels rendering the “food vs fuel” quandary a moot point. Upon commercialization, third-generation biofuels will undoubtedly be one of the most significant alternative renewable fuels, which can substantially resolve the food security challenges by not directly competing with food crop production and creating employment to boost the rural economy.","Debnath D., Das A.",Third-generation biofuels and food security,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138121443&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-323-90971-6.00041-3&partnerID=40&md5=00308296649ec06060dcef69c85b591a
Aquaculture and Fisheries,"Fish constitute important high protein products to meet the demands of an increasing global population. However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing. Thus, addressing key challenges by way of the global digital transformation of fishery and aquaculture industry will meet several sustainable development goals of the United Nations catered around the application of disruptive technology.",Rowan N.J.,The role of digital technologies in supporting and improving fishery and aquaculture across the supply chain – Quo Vadis?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134165257&doi=10.1016%2fj.aaf.2022.06.003&partnerID=40&md5=26ccbe049415e4743e5e7dc792d4ae12
Marine Biology Research,"Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs) are time-bound, public efforts to improve specific aspects of environmental or sustainability performance in a fishery. They rely upon a joint effort by seafood stakeholders to leverage action to move a fishery toward greater sustainability through developing and implementing better policies, management and fishing practices, supported in part by the supply chain exercising informed purchasing choices of fisheries products. This study sought to examine available evidence of the ability of FIPs, through the actions of the FIP participants if successfully implemented in the future, to galvanize conservation and sustainability improvements in fisheries at various spatial and jurisdictional scales. Twenty-seven publicly reported FIPs (and their associated fisheries) were reviewed to: (1) identify endangered, threatened, or protected (ETP) species interactions with the fisheries considered, (2) analyse which FIPs had planned or were already implementing measures to specifically address aspects of bycatch of ETP species, (3) identify new or additional necessary improvement actions for ETP species in FIP workplans, and (4) develop general guidance to improve the development of the ETP-related components of FIP workplans. Out of the FIPs included for final consideration, only two appeared to have no interactions with ETP species. We identified three main areas related to addressing ETP bycatch where the remaining FIP workplans were found to be inadequate: (1) mitigation, (2) monitoring, and (3) stakeholder engagement.

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Focal companies in food supply chains face increasing pressure to produce food sustainably and lower the environmental impact across their supply chain (SC). Although governance mechanisms to manage suppliers and sub-suppliers have been established, focal companies in the food sector still lack effective tools to capture the actual environmental sustainability performance of their multi-tier SCs, which could support them to decrease the environmental impact associated to their products. This work thus aims to showcase how assessing the environmental sustainability performance of a multi-tier food SC made up by SMEs can support decisions in order to drive evidence-based green improvements in the SC operations. A low-input eco-intensity-based multicriteria performance assessment method was applied to a bread SC, adopting a longitudinal case study design, to evaluate its applicability for decision-making in an operating context. Following the identification of environmental hotspots along the SC, targeted green operational improvements were implemented within individual organisations, resulting in a decrease of the eco-intensity values both at the targeted SC tiers and at the overall SC level. These results demonstrated that the method was able to support the improvement of the SC environmental performance. This work is the first longitudinal study in the multi-tier green supply chain management (GSCM) area. It contributes to the multi-tier food GSCM and GSCM performance assessment fields by demonstrating how the integration of environmental sustainability performance assessment methods and SC governance mechanisms can effectively support across time the deployment of GSCM within food SCs, while adopting an indirect SC management approach. Finally, the application of the method within a supply chain consisting of SMEs, inexperienced in sustainability assessment, demonstrates its potential to achieve SC-wide sustainability assessment and contributes to the wider GSCM field by providing insights on the implementation of GSCM in supply chains dominated by SMEs.","Tuni A., Rentizelas A.",Improving environmental sustainability in agri-food supply chains: Evidence from an eco-intensity-based method application,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138770145&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2022.100081&partnerID=40&md5=8926f01e03ba05de31cfaf2952380e6a
Business Strategy and the Environment,"Food and beverage companies have a very significant environmental and social impact, and this has become a global issue. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the drivers and barriers to implementing sustainability in large food and beverage companies and their supply chains. A total of 21 semistructured interviews were undertaken with 16 large food and beverage companies operating in Australia, including 11 multinationals. Institutional theory and extended resource-based view (ERBV) were applied to evaluate the companies' responses to the external pressures that they faced. The lack of a government regulatory and environmental framework was seen as a major barrier, while top management commitment was generally strong across the sample companies and was seen as a key internal driver. In order to develop an effective sustainability strategy, it is important that a company understands the drivers and barriers to sustainability implementation so that the appropriate actions can be taken.

"Advances in Science, Technology and Innovation","Food and water security and variability are some of the crucial challenges facing communities worldwide. Qatar is concerned with such challenges due to its nature and the rapid population growth. The 2017 blockade only further aggravated the situation since it interrupted the food supply chain, and therefore, food security.

The proposed units of the project include agriculture production units, livestock production units, fish farms, and a composting unit for the management of farm wastes. This project is expected to be of great benefit to the Qatari food and water sectors. It can contribute to reducing the gap between the demand and supply for food thanks to its advantages over the conventional agriculture and farming systems.","Alkhouzaam A., Rebeeh Y., Elhafez O., Elhadi E.",Food and Water Security in Qatar: Current Challenges Caused by the Blockade and Proposed Solutions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129858594&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-76081-6_98&partnerID=40&md5=5509921a4ef342a02475e11456750f2c
Food Systems Modelling: Tools for Assessing Sustainability in Food and Agriculture,"Food companies increasingly leverage models to track, communicate, and improve the environmental impacts associated with their value chains. Some companies use models to account for a triple bottom line business framework that tracks metrics across social, environmental, and financial parameters. Many communicate about environmental impact to appeal to sustainability-conscious consumers, investors, and other stakeholders. Most major food companies in North America now use models to estimate and publicly report on the greenhouse gas emissions caused by their business activities. Many companies are also pursuing modeling tools to substantiate what the Federal Trade Commission calls green marketing-communications that celebrate the environmental benefits of products. While the burgeoning use of models within the food industry signals a growing commitment to address the environmental impacts of food production, industry applications of these tools have their limits. In this chapter we discuss two key limitations that many food companies face when using life cycle assessment (LCA), the most widely used modeling tool to estimate environmental outcomes in agriculture: 1) LCA is limited in its ability to characterize geospatial factors and agricultural practices unique to specific supply chains; and 2) LCA databases are not designed to reliably track companies’ environmental impact progress over time. Without understanding these limitations, companies may struggle to identify some of the most significant opportunities to improve environmental performance in the food supply chain. To meaningfully address climate change and other pressing environmental challenges, companies must recognize modeling limitations while simultaneously taking urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve other environmental outcomes of their business activities.","Skonberg C., Thorbecke M.",Applying environmental models in the food business context,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128584101&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-12-822112-9.00009-6&partnerID=40&md5=03119e299507db4b4e17ad7acc0a96b2
European Journal of Agronomy,"Food grade maize dedicated to dry milling is an ingredient used in everyday foods, such as breakfast cereals, snacks, baked goods, and beer. Argentina has developed a supply chain producing high quality food grade hard endosperm maize for national and international dry milling markets. In modern times, European countries uniquely source their imported hard endosperm food grade maize from Argentina. Here we describe some of the challenges and opportunities this centralized supply chain is facing. There is a 10–30% yield gap between regular dent and hard endosperm commercial hybrids, depending on the specific genotype and environment, and we anticipate it will continue increasing. Grain quality vs. yield trade-off is the most important challenge, and to cope with this issue the supply chain is slowly adapting to use food grade hybrids with higher physical field yields but slightly lower grain hardness than traditional ones. However, there is a clear opportunity to genetically manipulate grain hardness thanks to the known role of the specific proteins involved. Another opportunity is crop management optimization at the field level. Minimum advice is given to farmers other than genotype selection, leaving them with limited decision support regarding fertilizer or plant population, two management practices with significant grain quality effects. Opportunities also arise from market development based on the nutritional characteristics of this specialty grain (such as 122% higher β-branch carotenoids, 4% lower glycemic index of cooked flours because of lower starch digestibility, and 37% higher grain Zn than softer dent germplasm), or sustainability aspects of the supply chain. We highlight the capacity to track farmers through the current use of identity preserved (IP) programs detailing where, who, and how the grain was produced or impose any needed farming practice change. All these aspects are relevant for other food chains using maize dry milling products around the globe.","Borrás L., Caballero-Rothar N.N., Saenz E., Segui M., Gerde J.A.",Challenges and opportunities of hard endosperm food grade maize sourced from South America to Europe,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135129859&doi=10.1016%2fj.eja.2022.126596&partnerID=40&md5=68af9d93662b7293d0a2a7a8db5ba0aa
Journal of Food Science and Technology,"Food Industries, at this moment, are moving towards a new phase, and this phase will be governed by consumers and not by the industry leaders. The report shows that claims on sustainability, health, wellness, and transparency would govern the future trends in the food industry. Currently, there are several cases of misleading and false claims which hamper consumer trust. So, to uphold consumer trust, authentication of claims through transparency in the food supply chain is required, and blockchain technology can bring transparency at relatively low transaction costs. Once in a blockchain network, data is very difficult to manipulate, with no single point of authority to mess and collapse the system. Though we see mostly the financial systems using blockchain's decentralized functionality, there is a growing trend of innovative applications being built in the supply chain area for contracts and operations. With effort in the right direction and over time, blockchain will recast how operations and processes are done across the industry, including public sectors. The paper reviews the opportunity for the blockchain in enabling food industries for future-readiness, empowering the consumers in verifying the product claims and thus prevent themselves from food fraud. In doing so, the paper considers the future trends in the food industry, identifies current food fraud cases, and outlines the various applications in the agri-food chain and challenges associated with it.

Uncertain Supply Chain Management,"Food industry has vital importance globally in which supply chain sustainability plays a key role. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the role of passion, planning, goal setting and target achievement in a sustainable supply chain. This study examined the relationship between passion, planning, goal setting, target achievement and sustainable supply chain among the food industry of Indonesia. Questionnaire survey was preferred, and 500 questionnaires were used for data collection. Findings of the study concluded that passion has a positive role in target achievement and an insignificant effect on sustainable supply chain. Planning has a positive effect on target achievement and sustainable supply chain. Moreover, goal setting has a positive role in target achievement and no role in supply chain. Furthermore, target achievement has a significant mediating role. Finally, the relationship between passion, planning, goal setting, target achievement and sustainable supply chain has valuable contributions to the literature.","Hiranphaet A., Suksai T., Chumkad K., Sujarit R., Phudetch P., Son-Ong S., Vaiyavuth R., Jermsittiparsert K., Siliboon R.","The relationship between passion, planning, goal setting, target achievement and sustainable supply chain in food industry",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126082164&doi=10.5267%2fj.uscm.2021.11.010&partnerID=40&md5=09bea1b85deaceb45cda6412498306cd
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Food loss and food waste are a global challenge as about one third of all food produced around the globe is lost or wasted at some point in the food supply chain, from the farm to the fork. Vegetable oils generate a considerable amount of waste and byproducts, and such byproducts represent valuable opportunities for the food industry. Given the obvious benefits of using byproducts, special attention should be paid to the safety issues, especially when it comes to reintroducing them into the food chain. In this study, the quality and safety of several vegetable oil industry byproducts were evaluated in order to further consider them as potential ingredients in functional foods. Microbiological tests, mycotoxin assessments, and a heavy metal analysis were performed. The microbiological analysis showed reduced contamination with spoilage microorganisms, and a lack of contamination with pathogenic bacteria. All of the samples noted levels of deoxynivalenol, and, with a few exceptions, the heavy metal levels were below the maximum allowed limits. This study also notes the lack of regulation for this category of products. This not only puts the possibility of capitalizing on many food byproducts at risk, but also their widespread use as ingredients for the production of new functional products and their safe consumption.","Smeu I., Dobre A.A., Cucu E.M., Mustățea G., Belc N., Ungureanu E.L.",Byproducts from the Vegetable Oil Industry: The Challenges of Safety and Sustainability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124624497&doi=10.3390%2fsu14042039&partnerID=40&md5=b2af1359edec15abef259a5dbb6dc845
Business Strategy and the Environment,"Food loss and waste are major issues in the food industry, and they affect all stages of the food supply chain (FSC). Food loss and waste are linked to environmental deterioration, economic loss, and an increase in hunger. Therefore, the food industry requires sustainable consumption and production (SCP) to reduce losses and waste. The circular economy (CE) concept has become a popular strategy for reducing food waste and boosting sustainability. Therefore, with efficient reverse logistics in the FSC, food producers can help achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) like SCP and zero hunger. In literature, minimal research has been available in identifying the CE adoption challenges in FSC. This research identifies 15 critical challenges from the literature and discussion with the panel of experts. The relationship between the challenges has been established through an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique. The challenges were characterized in cause–effect according to their relational intensity obtained using the grey decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique. Grey's relational theory is applied in DEMATEL to minimize uncertainty and vagueness of the expert judgment. The findings of this study suggest that creating policy from the government, providing incentives, and strictly enforcing environmental regulations are the most critical challenge. Hence, by focusing on the above, the effective adoption of the CE principle is achieved. This result also suggests that by addressing the challenges of CE, corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be performed. This study provides some recommendations for the practitioners to adopt CE towards sustainable development targets.","Kumar M., Raut R.D., Jagtap S., Choubey V.K.",Circular economy adoption challenges in the food supply chain for sustainable development,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133488348&doi=10.1002%2fbse.3191&partnerID=40&md5=71e99f00f978c0a521a916031bcb4901
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Food loss and waste are two of the many problems that modern society is facing. To date, among many solutions, the circular economy is the one prevailing. A successful transition toward a circular economy (CE) requires the food sector to overcome the challenges of today’s complex food supply chains such as information asymmetry, poor cooperation among stakeholders, and concerns about food safety. Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology, has been progressively gaining traction in supply chains in areas like data management, certifying product provenance and tracking products. Despite its importance, knowledge around the potential of the blockchain technology in facilitating the transition towards a circular economy in the agri-food sector is fragmented. This review provides evidence-based insights into the blockchain implementations in the food supply chains and the implications for CE. Our findings indicated four major areas that blockchain could accelerate CE in the agri-food sector: improving data utility; supply chain management efficacy; enhanced eco-efficiency; and superior traceability.","Pakseresht A., Ahmadi Kaliji S., Xhakollari V.",How Blockchain Facilitates the Transition toward Circular Economy in the Food Chain?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138685256&doi=10.3390%2fsu141811754&partnerID=40&md5=e5ed9d7f9be1dbde3632218a5b92f550
Waste Management and Research,"Food loss and waste have become an issue of global significance, considering their concurrent effects on the socioeconomic and environmental facet of society. Despite this domain gaining prolific attention recently, issues hampering the effective utilization of residues from fish processing usually go unidentified in developing economies such as India. This occurs mainly owing to fragmented supply chains, inappropriate handling, discontinuous cold chains, inadequate temperature monitoring and so on, affecting quality and causing underuse. Any researcher trying to understand the prospects of utilizing these fish processing co-streams in a developing economy with the vision of improving consumption, economic sustainability, reducing discards and promoting circularity faces a lacuna. The authors address this demand in research by identifying the validity of this domain both in the global and native research community by conducting a detailed review using bibliometric analysis and content analysis. Data from Scopus with 717 documents, comprising 612 research articles from 78 countries, 1597 organizations and 2587 authors, are analysed. Results signify (i) developing a focus on hydroxyapatite production, bio-methane generation, transesterification processes, biomass and the rest raw material generated from fish processing, and (ii) reduced research on supply chain-related aspects despite their considerable importance. To comprehend this deficiency, especially in the Indian stance, barriers hindering the utilization of generated by-products are identified, and recommendations for improvements are proposed.

"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Food loss has been widely identified as a key barrier to food security and environmental sustainability in developing countries. However, there remains a lack of empirical studies on the scales and patterns of food loss along the food supply chain in developing countries especially with updated and primary data. In this study, we aim to address this significant gap for China, based on a large-scale field study with questionnaire survey and qualitative interview of 1809 farmer households in 35 major agricultural producing counties of 12 provinces across China between April 2017 and September 2019. Three main agricultural products, staple food, vegetables, and fruits, and their entire supply chain from agricultural production to post-harvest handling, storage, processing, and distribution were covered. The normalized total losses of staple food, vegetables, and fruits added up to 7.9%, 27.7%, and 13.2%, respectively, of their total production. The major loss of staple food occurs at production stage, while post-harvest handling stage and distribution stage, respectively, contribute the most to vegetables and fruits losses. Although China's leapfrogging progress and technology development in recent years have resulted in a reduction of food loss, it was estimated that between 40% and 60% of these losses can still be further mitigated. Such primary data could improve our understanding on the scales and patterns of supply chain food losses in China and thus better inform food loss reduction interventions and associated economic and environmental mitigation strategies.","Lu S., Cheng G., Li T., Xue L., Liu X., Huang J., Liu G.","Quantifying supply chain food loss in China with primary data: A large-scale, field-survey based analysis for staple food, vegetables, and fruits",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118100095&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2021.106006&partnerID=40&md5=ac1059a6078860e2df4b393ef7ef6fde
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Food organizations have seen pressure from stakeholders, consumers, governments, and other international agencies to adopt sustainable practices in their business operations. Sustainable development is the current need for the agri-food sector to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDG) established by the United Nations.

This study developed a sustainable performance assessment (SPA) framework through integrated triple bottom line (TBL) and circular economy practice. The weights of sustainable dimensions and key performance indicators (KPIs) have been determined using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP). A fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (F-TOPSIS) has been used to evaluate sustainable performance and rank the alternatives.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Food security (FS) is one of the most elusive and sought-after objectives worldwide. Securing a country’s self-sufficiency— in the current COVID-19 pandemic era, more than ever—has become a prioritized mission. In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, FS is adversely affected by, among others, the scarcity of freshwater, harsh environment, regional conflicts, and rising temperatures. Following the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, exporters placed export restrictions on key food crops, affecting FS in import dependent regions, such as the MENA countries and, more specifically, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This paper presented a conceptual framework on the key enablers for the UAE agri-food supply chains to obtain the necessary resiliency to achieve FS, through improving policy-making capacity. The proposed approach started with the assessment of the main vulnerabilities of the food system in a global context; from there, the factors that influence vulnerability were investigated, identifying the main global drivers that affect the local food systems, focusing on the UAE.

Food Research,"Food security and food safety are key aspects of healthy and sustainable food production. However, threats of natural disasters and diseases are grave concerns that serious precautions need to be taken as the threats may be harmful to the agricultural industry. Currently, food insecurity has become a significant big challenge in food chain supply, and there is an urgency for the government to address the issue. The aim of this review paper was to understand the relationship of food safety, food security and sustainable food production to ensure a sustainable food system to maintain adequate nourishment for the growing world population. The collaboration between governments, academicians, producers, and consumers is fundamental to raising awareness about the importance of food security. Nutrition educators can help at the grassroots level to identify the problems and help to find possible solutions. Modern technology such as RFID tags and blockchain could offer possible solutions to improve food security and sustainability. This will ensure that food products become safer and consumers can have access to precise information before consuming the products.

"2022 2nd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering, ICACITE 2022","Food supply chain is a complex but necessary food production arrangement needed by the global community to maintain sustainability and food security. For the past few years, entities being a part of the food processing system have usually taken food supply chain for granted, they forget that just one disturbance in the chain can lead to poisoning, scarcity, or increased prices. This continually affects the vulnerable among society, including impoverished individuals and small restaurants/grocers. The food supply chain has been expanded across the globe involving many more entities, making the supply chain longer and more problematic making the traditional logistics pattern unable to match the expectations of customers. Food supply chains involve many challenges like lack of traceability and communication, supply of fraudulent food products and failure in monitoring warehouses. Therefore there is a need for a system that ensures authentic information about the product, a reliable trading mechanism. In this paper, we have proposed a comprehensive solution to make the supply chain consumer centric by using Blockchain.

"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","Food Supply Chains (FCSs) are center-stage in the global conversation on sustainability. The challenge of food loss and waste is prominent in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Goals, which demands halving the per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030. Consumer awareness of food safety and health has also greatly increased in the last few decades; correspondingly, confidence in the quality of food has greatly decreased. Studies show that local and organic foods are perceived by consumers to be relatively healthier, and this new interest has led to academics and industry practitioners exploring a holistic understanding of FSCs a to tackle such emerging challenges. Several studies have examined FSCs through the lenses of circular economy principles, leading to the emerging term, circular food supply chains (CFSCs). Emergent digital technologies, including blockchain technologies (BCT), are touted to provide traceability, transparency and scalability which, if applied in FSCs, may help to address many of these challenges. However, the theory and technology of circular economy and BCT have, to-date, had only limited influence on FSCs due to inherent and/or perceived application risks. Further, there is a need for more considered and strategic integration of digital technologies, in general, as mechanisms for identify and mitigating potential risks, and achieving desired outcomes. Using a hybrid modelling approach of fuzzy set theory and interpretive structural modelling, this paper develops and proposes a framework in identifying and analysing these integration risks.","Okorie O., Russell J.D.",Exploring the Risks of Blockchain and Circular Economy Initiatives in Food Supply Chains: A Hybrid Model Practice Framework,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115859539&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-6128-0_28&partnerID=40&md5=42024bf3b00a49eaaddd409807446f86
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Food supply chains (FSCs) not only need to be competitive, but increasingly face scarce resources and societal pressure for sustainable development. This paper assesses the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of five different FSCs that are all competing for the same primary product. We used the value chain methodology for the economic sustainability, life cycle assessment for the analysis of environmental sustainability, and a scoring approach for social sustainability. We applied these methodologies to five FSCs competing for mangoes in Burkina Faso: 1) the FSC of fresh mangoes exported (by boat or by plane) to the European Union, 2) the FSC of fresh mangoes exported to continental Africa, 3) the FSC of dried mangoes exported to Europe, 4) the FSC of mango juice and puree, and 5), the FSC of fresh mangoes consumed in Burkina Faso. For each FSC, we considered: 1) the added value per kilogramme; 2) male and female employment; 3) the contribution to the national economy; 4) working conditions; 5) the contribution to household food and nutritional security; 6) damage to human health per added value, 7) damage to ecosystems per added value, and 8) increased resource scarcity per added value. None of the FSCs obtained a perfect score. The domestic FSC had the best sustainability indicators and the African FSC distributed the highest share of added value to farmers. The number of middlemen, the operating costs, the trade value of the mangoes, and bargaining power, are the main factors affecting the distribution of the added value. The informal sector is a major factor that affects the social assessment through access to land and to most social rights. Distance and transport technology are the main factors that affect the environmental sustainability. Our results will help improve benchmarking of FSCs in a sustainability framework, targeting of private funding investment, and policy support for sustainable development.","Parrot L., Biard Y., Klaver D., Kabré E., Vannière H.","Slicing the fruit five ways: An economic, social, and environmental assessment of five mango food supply chains in Burkina Faso",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123954779&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.01.019&partnerID=40&md5=4ab138c2511b4e9227f952bcf01bc8fb
Journal of Business Research,"Food supply chains are key to ensuring sufficient nourishment of the population. For instance, taking a circular economy approach can help facilitate the adoption of sustainable practices, such as the use of technology to combat food waste issues. Yet, creating intrinsically sustainable production systems remains complex, given differing stakeholder perspectives, structures and approaches that can be entrenched along supply chains. Based on an empirical investigation conducted in the UK dairy supply chain, and implementing a critical discourse analysis, this paper aims at gaining an understanding how sustainable storylines are either propagated or supressed by different stakeholders. The paper contributes to the theoretical debate on power in supply chains through the lens of cultural hegemony and the discourse coalition concept, leading to the theoretical contribution of this work: an explanation of how a self-perpetuating cycle of legitimacy helps a storyline become, and remain, dominant.","Else T., Choudhary S., Genovese A.",Uncovering sustainability storylines from dairy supply chain discourse,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123062765&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2021.12.023&partnerID=40&md5=7cecf7f4bf3f4742e084d661bc39b80d
Fish and Fisheries,"Food system is a powerful concept for understanding and responding to nutrition and sustainability challenges. Food systems integrate social, economic, environmental and health aspects of food production through to consumption. Aquatic foods are an essential part of food systems providing an accessible source of nutrition for millions of people. Yet, it is unclear to what degree research across diverse disciplines concerning aquatic foods has engaged food systems, and the value this concept has added. We conducted a systematic review of fisheries, aquaculture and aquatic food literature (2017–2019) to determine the following: the characteristics of this research; the food systems components and interrelations with which research engaged; and the insights generated on nutrition, justice, sustainability and climate change. Sixty five of the 88 reviewed articles focussed on production and supply chains, with 23 considering human nutrition. Only 13% of studies examined low- and middle-income countries that are most vulnerable to undernutrition. One third of articles looked beyond finfish to other aquatic foods, which illuminated values of local knowledge systems and diverse foods for nutrition. When aggregated, reviewed articles examined the full range of food system drivers—biophysical and environmental (34%), demographic (24%) and socio-cultural (27%)—but rarely examined interactions between drivers. Future research that examines a diversity of species in diets, system-wide flows of nutrients, trade-offs amongst objectives, and the nutritional needs of vulnerable social groups would be nudging closer to the ambitions of the food systems concept, which is necessary to address the global challenges of equity, nutrition and sustainability.","Simmance F.A., Cohen P.J., Huchery C., Sutcliffe S., Suri S.K., Tezzo X., Thilsted S.H., Oosterveer P., McDougall C., Ahern M., Freed S., Byrd K.A., Wesana J., Cowx I.G., Mills D.J., Akester M., Chan C.Y., Nagoli J., Wate J.T., Phillips M.J.",Nudging fisheries and aquaculture research towards food systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111361919&doi=10.1111%2ffaf.12597&partnerID=40&md5=c123be82019baa4c5f0433e0b626be8a
Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability,"Food system transformations that are driven by climate change and urbanization have important implications for the food retail landscape of urban sub-Saharan Africa. Urban populations in sub-Saharan Africa are growing rapidly, climate change shocks are increasingly common, and the spatial footprints of cities are expanding, all of which challenge food systems to meet the needs of urban consumers. As supply chains increase in complexity and length, urban food retailers are increasingly vulnerable to more variable and extreme events associated with climate change. Urban food systems are also changing in response to urbanization through a variety of linkages, such as rising incomes, changing diet preferences, and the growth of the supermarket industry. Considering the roles and diversity of food retailers within urban food systems is a critical step to understanding and addressing the specific pathways through which urbanization and climate change will impact food system sustainability across rapidly growing African cities.","Blekking J., Giroux S., Waldman K., Battersby J., Tuholske C., Robeson S.M., Siame G.",The impacts of climate change and urbanization on food retailers in urban sub-Saharan Africa,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126304011&doi=10.1016%2fj.cosust.2022.101169&partnerID=40&md5=8705fff2ddc3fd1b30e55943a02f2547
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Food systems are both contributing to and affected by environmental degradation and climate change. The transition towards resilient and sustainable food systems is essential to ensure food security and minimise negative environmental impacts. Innovative technologies can accelerate this transition. Blockchain technology (BCT) is attracting attention as it can deliver transparency to complex global food supply chains and has the potential to guide current food production towards better sustainability and efficiency. This case study investigated the opportunities that BCT can offer to food supply chains. Qualitative interviews with eight main BCT providers were conducted to evaluate the current state of BCT and put it into perspective by mapping out advantages, disad-vantages, incentives, motives, and expectations connected to its implementation in global food sys-tems. A thematic analysis showed that, while BCT was considered beneficial by all interviewees, uptake is slow due to high implementation costs and the lack of incentives for companies throughout the food chain from farms to food industry and retail. Results further revealed that the advantages of BCT go beyond communication of trustworthy information and development of closer producer–consumer relationships. In fact, it can provide the opportunity to decrease food waste, enhance working conditions throughout the supply chain, and promote sustainable consumption habits. As BCT may be increasingly used in the food supply chain, the results give a basis for future research that may leverage both qualitative and quantitative methods to examine actors’ behav-iours. Also, the importance of improving user experiences through functional applications and soft-ware to facilitate the adoption of the technology is stressed.","Wünsche J.F., Fernqvist F.",The Potential of Blockchain Technology in the Transition Towards Sustainable Food Systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133292666&doi=10.3390%2fsu14137739&partnerID=40&md5=1e3d60d4e37f12f8fff7459c7396cd85
Food Systems Modelling: Tools for Assessing Sustainability in Food and Agriculture,"Food Systems Modelling emphasizes sustainability, including the impact of agriculture and food production on profits, people and environment, with a particular focus on the ability of humanity to continue producing food in the midst of global environmental change. Sections introduce the purpose of models, the definition of a food system, the importance of disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary inquiry, cover specific branches of modeling in the sustainability of food systems, and wrestle with the challenge of communicating modeling research and appropriately integrating multiple dimensions of sustainability.

Biomaterials,"Food systems of the future will need to face an increasingly clear reality – that a protein-rich diet is essential for good health, but traditional meat products will not suffice to ensure safety, sustainability, and equity of food supply chains at a global scale. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of bioprocess technologies needed for cell-based meat production and challenges in reaching commercial scale. Specifically, it reviews state-of-the-art bioprocess technologies, current limitations, and opportunities for research across four domains: cell line development, cell culture media, scaffolding, and bioreactors. This also includes exploring innovations to make cultured meat a viable protein alternative across numerous key performance indicators and for specific applications where traditional livestock is not an option (e.g., local production, space exploration). The paper explores tradeoffs between production scale, product quality, production cost, and footprint over different time horizons. Finally, a discussion explores various factors that may impact the ability to successfully scale and market cultured meat products: social acceptance, environmental tradeoffs, regulatory guidance, and public health benefits. While the exact nature of the transition from traditional livestock to alternative protein products is uncertain, it has already started and will likely continue to build momentum in the next decade.","Chen L., Guttieres D., Koenigsberg A., Barone P.W., Sinskey A.J., Springs S.L.","Large-scale cultured meat production: Trends, challenges and promising biomanufacturing technologies",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120499280&doi=10.1016%2fj.biomaterials.2021.121274&partnerID=40&md5=7abe38c87cb60ad4b6fc7a15552897a7
Nutrients,"Food waste is a global problem, which becomes apparent at various stages of the food supply chain. The present research study focuses on the optimization of food consumption in schools and effective food management through data-driven decision making within the trends: zero food waste and digital transformation. The paper presents a plate waste forecasting system based on mathematical modeling and simulation using the Monte Carlo method, which showed an RMSE equal to ±3% and a MAPE of 10.15%. The solution based on the simulator provides a possibility to better understand the relationship between the parameters investigated through data visualization and apply this knowledge to train managers to make decisions that are more effective.

Journal of Macromarketing,"Food waste is a problem that occurs throughout the supply chain, squandering natural resources, and contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While attention has been directed at systems designed to facilitate movement of food from manufacturer to consumers, little is known on alternative practices to recover food products no longer desired by the consumers. Responding to calls for greater attention to systems elements in macromarketing and for work that challenges the WEIRD hegemony, we investigate the issue of how collaborative networks can support more robust food systems. A qualitative case study draws on prolonged participant observation and depth interviews to address the question, “How do stakeholders in collaborative networks achieve shared system outcomes?” We apply institutional logic and the concept of coopetition to explore the dynamics within a food recovery network. Our findings suggest that notwithstanding shared commitments to sustainability, competition and conflicting interests can compromise systems performance. This study contributes a new perspective of collaborative network behaviour and highlights shortfalls in current theory and practices resulting from reliance on data collected from WEIRD contexts.","Kunchamboo V., Little V.J., Cheah S.K.A.","Common Cause, coopetition or competition?

Smart Cities,"Food waste is an important social and environmental issue that the current society faces, where one third of the total food produced is wasted or lost every year while more than 820 million people around the world do not have access to adequate food. However, as we move towards a decentralized Web 3.0 enabled smart city, we can utilize cutting edge technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and many more to reduce food waste in different phases of the supply chain. In this paper, we propose SmartNoshWaste—a blockchain based multi-layered framework utilizing cloud computing, QR code and reinforcement learning to reduce food waste. We also evaluate SmartNoshWaste on real world food data collected from the nosh app to show the efficacy of the proposed framework and we are able to reduce food waste by 9.46% in comparison to the originally collected food data based on the experimental evaluation.","Dey S., Saha S., Singh A.K., McDonald-Maier K.","SmartNoshWaste: Using Blockchain, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing and QR Code to Reduce Food Waste in Decentralized Web 3.0 Enabled Smart Cities",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124900839&doi=10.3390%2fsmartcities5010011&partnerID=40&md5=c8d34d3e030b72216525fd595fb25e6c
Value-Addition in Food Products and Processing Through Enzyme Technology,"Food waste is generated during many steps of food supply chain after harvesting or transporting food products to consumers or the market: from postproduction, manufacturing, handling, storage, wholesale, and retail to consumption. Value chains are recognized as the utmost promising alleyways to achieving a resource-efficient globular economy. Food production currently dealing with incredible challenges as the human populations growing fastly, maintaining cleanliness of resources, quality and sustainability of food is a more cooperative effort ensuing in development support from governments as well as enterprises. Various attempts were promoted in various areas, and segments of food, but these areas were more neglected in innovation and technology by using biological agents. Value addition in supply chain of foods is very wide where the various steps can involve and each step is adding its own way of value addition like farmer, suppliers, processor, distribution, and retailers. This contributes to technological advances, growth of socioeconomic, and environmental profits. Globally agriculture market showed very complication of modern consumers and mandate for food safety and the most important products quality. All those demands triggered and changed structure of food industry as well as supply chain system. The more differentiation in food products variety and over the time value addition dramatically altered the price value of food products from farm value to retail values. The changeover to a bioeconomy period can be simplified by developing consolidated bioprocesses that consult a holistic method and focus on innovative end applications that could be integrated into existing manufacturing plants. Efficient and holistic resource use is unambiguously a precondition to consider within advancement of bioconversion fermentation.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Food waste management is a growing environmental and economic issue for a developing country like India. This exploratory paper aims to prioritize key practices as “criteria” for food supply chains that lead to food waste reduction to ensure green waste management. Twenty-five criteria from the existing literature and expert inputs were assessed to resolve food waste reduction issues in food supply chains, especially in the agricultural sectors. The study identifies and ranks the intensities of each of the listed criteria. In the study, the Best-Worst Method, a multi-criteria decision-making approach, is applied. According to the findings, waste prevention at the earlier stages of food supply chains is given more priority compared to food waste minimization and treatment at the later stages. Hence, the study concludes “skill and training” as the highest ranked criteria, followed by “protection and infrastructure.” Further, the study infers that understanding the individual intensities of criteria within a food supply chain can affect waste generation at each level, having a significant impact on waste reduction.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Food waste negatively impacts the three dimensions of sustainability. Environmentally and financially, it represents a waste of natural resources and increases the cost respectively. Socially, it represents an ethical issue as about 800 million people are suffering from hunger worldwide. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore if and how resilience contributes to food waste reduction in fruits and vegetables distribution in the Brazilian market. Multiple case studies were conducted in the supplier-retailer dyad of four retail chains. Results have shown that resilience plays the role of both enabler and barrier to food waste reduction. On the positive side, collaboration, communication, flexibility, innovation, knowledge management, leadership, security technologies and supply chain design contributed to food waste reduction; especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the negative side, financial health and redundancy increased the level of food waste. Additionally, it was observed that flexibility can reduce or increase food waste. Our findings have implications for academics and practitioners as the developed framework summarizes the role of resilience to food waste reduction. As a social impact, the implementation of food waste reduction initiatives by non-governmental organizations and retailer associations can result in increased communication, knowledge diffusion, and training about how to build resilience and improve food waste reduction practices among different agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that explores the relationship among elements of resilience and food waste. Thus, it advances the current literature by operationalizing resilience to reduce food waste.","Costa F.H.D.O., de Moraes C.C., da Silva A.L., Delai I., Chaudhuri A., Pereira C.R.",Does resilience reduce food waste?

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Food waste reduction represents a potential opportunity to enhance environmental sustainability. This is especially important in fresh products such as fresh seafood, where waste levels are substantially higher than those of other food products. In this particular case, reducing waste is also vital to meet demand while conserving fisheries. This paper aims to promote more sustainable supply chains by proposing daily fresh fish demand forecasting models that can be used by grocery retailers to align supply and demand, and hence prevent the production of food waste. To accomplish this goal, we explored the potential of different machine learning models, namely Long Short-Term Memory networks, Feedforward neural networks, Support Vector Regression, and Random Forests, as well as a Holt-Winters statistical model. Demand censorship was considered to capture real demand. To validate the proposed methodology, we estimated the demand for fresh fish in a representative store of a large European retailing company used as a case study. The results revealed that the machine learning models provided accurate forecasts in comparison to the baseline models and the statistical model, with the Long Short-Term Memory networks model yielding, in general, the best results in terms of root mean squared error (27.82), mean absolute error (20.63) and mean positive error (17.86). Thus, the implementation of these types of models can thus have a positive impact on the sustainability of fresh fish species and customer satisfaction.","Miguéis V.L., Pereira A., Pereira J., Figueira G.",Reducing fresh fish waste while ensuring availability: Demand forecast using censored data and machine learning,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129948876&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.131852&partnerID=40&md5=fcd2248b889dae74f378be9f0195d5f9
Agribusiness,"Food waste, or loss, at the wholesale and retail levels accounts for some 40% of the total amount of supply-chain waste. While zero waste is never optimal, there are managerial variables that contribute to the level of loss. In this paper, we use data from a large beverage distributor to estimate the most important causes of loss, and investigate which can be controlled in an economically-viable way. Controlling for a range of important environmental (uncontrollable) variables, we find that competitive pricing, case sets, assortment size, package size, and inefficiency are the most important determinants of loss. However, our most important finding highlights the importance of “discretion over rules” in inventory management as salesforce discretion in delivering less-than-ordered amounts is statistically important and one of the only ways management can directly influence supply-chain loss. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on food and beverage supply-chain sustainability, food loss and waste, and inventory management. As such, our findings are likely to be of interest to both managers in the food and beverage supply chain (manufacturers, distributors, and retailers) and policy makers interested in reducing food and beverage loss and improving food system sustainability.

Materials Today: Proceedings,"For a decade the construction industry has been on its all-time low in productivity due to its lack of adaptability to the digitization of society. In comparison, the manufacturing and production industries have been able to successfully integrate computer applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT) into their processes. As a result, their economic progression has received a significant uplift. Digitization and automation in the construction industry is a relatively young sector with a lot of opportunities for research and innovation. An excellent instrument for surveying resources and operations is a digital environment for monitoring the construction supply chain management framework (CSCM). For infrastructure projects, building information modeling and geographic information systems are strongly encouraged for improved productivity and better coordination. The convergence of BIM and GIS creates a complete digital representation of the physical environment. BIM may be used to produce, manage, and exchange operational data of building structures, whereas GIS could be used to handle the logistic aspect of the construction project and store, organize, and analyze data representing the horizontally spread urban environment. As a result, the unified utilization of BIM and GIS is crucial in Urban Sustainability applications that require data from both facilities and the urban environment. Because BIM has only been around for around ten years, and combined BIM and GIS applications have only been around for an even shorter time, there is no solid framework on the latter for individuals who are just getting started with BIM and GIS in Civil Engineering. Review and analysis of previous works are required to have a better grasp of the current condition and future direction of the budding discipline.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"For green and sustainable supply chains, transportation resilience is a critical issue. Car Sharing is an effective way to improve transportation resilience. The emerging car-sharing industry continues to attract a lot of investment, but few companies in the industry are profitable. Indeed, numerical experiments based on dynamic models in this paper showed that it was challenging for a car-sharing company to be profitable. As the numerical experiments followed the fractional factorial designs, from the factor analysis, it is suggested that a new car-sharing business first study the external business environment. Even if the external environment is sound, the company still needs to pay attention to internal operations management. Moreover, when the company decides the number of cars it owns and the fleet size, it should consider factors including variable daily expenses, maintenance costs, salvage value, and commission.","Zhou W., Wang H., Shi V., Chen X.",A Decision Model for Free-Floating Car-Sharing Providers for Sustainable and Resilient Supply Chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134033555&doi=10.3390%2fsu14138159&partnerID=40&md5=4a850b59e6caa8c40f4febb4a58b836d
Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,"For stakeholders and decision makers within the bioeconomy, it is important that sustainability assessment methodologies be holistic, reliable, and accurate. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies are well-known for their ability to avoid burden shifting by considering the impacts of a product, process, or system throughout the full life cycle. However, when it comes to assessing advanced multifunctional systems within the bioeconomy i.e. biorefineries, methodological challenges arise. Such issues are discussed at length in this review paper, which include the goal, scope, and allocation methods, land use considerations, handling of biogenic carbon and emissions, impacts assessed, simplification of feedstocks and processes, regionality, and future foreground and background systems. Furthermore, the review discusses challenges in capturing social and economic impacts with LCA methodologies, with social assessments lacking data and appropriate quantitative indicators and economic assessments lacking diversity in stakeholder and cost inclusivity. Finally, this review confirms the importance of temporal factors, regional differences, and integrating multidimensional approaches to sustainability analysis, highlighting developing LCA methodologies which successfully address these areas. Methodologies to address spatial considerations include exergetic LCIA, natural capital assessment, and integration of supply chain modelling, while methodologies to address dynamic variability include process modelling integration, system dynamics modelling integration, agent-based modelling integration, consequential LCA, prospective LCA, and dynamic LCIA.

Key Engineering Materials,"Forced by environmental implications and by legislation requirements, the cement sector is moving towards more circular economy practices, with the primary aim to enhance the sector sustainability. This commitment translates into product technology innovation, but also into innovative development perspectives for the industries involved in the supply chain. Moreover, dealing with recycled materials can modify the interaction among stakeholders from a conventional supply chain to an industrial symbiosis approach, where companies mutually exchange products and by-products into circular interactions. The purpose of this article is to investigate the circularity performances deriving from the production of a cement mortar reinforced with recycled synthetic fibers coming from artificial turf carpets. From the collection of artificial turf carpets at the end-of-life stage it is possible to recover several materials: plastic fibers used in the cement mortar, and in addition, silica sand, rubber, and bituminous membrane. The production of the innovative reinforced cement mortar leads to the connection between industries belonging to different sectors and consequently to uneven economic and environmental implications.

Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,"Freight transportation has major economic, energy, and sustainability impacts. As a result, forecasting tools for analyzing policy scenarios are critical. However, existing freight transportation modeling tools have major gaps, especially in agent representation, prediction of fleet and distribution center control, and strategic alignment of agent decisions. We address these gaps by developing a new architecture for freight transportation modeling called CRISTAL: Collaborative, Informed, Strategic Trade Agents with Logistics. CRISTAL is an agent-based model that includes both firms and establishments (establishments are members of firms). Agents collaborate to form supply chain partnerships in trade and logistics. An Effect of Information captures information sharing in the supply chain, providing a mechanism to operationalize the push–pull boundary, which occurs at the customer-order decoupling point. Agents form strategies then align subsequent decisions with these strategies. Our CRISTAL implementation is multi-resolution, with urban freight linked to national and global supply chains. It is integrated with passenger activity, including household e-commerce use and passenger traffic. The framework has been applied to study e-commerce and truck traffic. This paper summarizes the conceptual model, its initial implementation, and applications to date.","Stinson M., Mohammadian A.K.","Introducing CRISTAL: A model of collaborative, informed, strategic trade agents with logistics",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123202638&doi=10.1016%2fj.trip.2022.100539&partnerID=40&md5=ef58a357c5d967caed0baee165cd898c

The related literature was classified into eight categories: namely, (1) value chain indicators of FFVSCs, (2) food-related problems/postharvest losses along FFVSCs, (3) roles of parties involved in the FFV value chain, (4) review papers, (5) technological trends in FFVSCs, (6) packaging issues of FFVSCs, (7) logistics solutions of FFVSCs, and (8) sustainable FFVSCs. Details on the tools and methods employed in these studies are summarized in Appendix B. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the related literature lacks a comprehensive review that investigates different aspects of FFVVCs in detail. Thus, this study contributes towards a better understanding of the related literature and can be used as a guide for future studies.","Tort Ö.Ö., Vayvay Ö., Çobanoğlu E.",A Systematic Review of Sustainable Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Supply Chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123405237&doi=10.3390%2fsu14031573&partnerID=40&md5=2b4b3efadc29f372a53fb17a62e9600c
Uncertain Supply Chain Management,"Fresh produce which are part of agricultural products that can survive during the pandemic in Indonesia, there is even an increase in supply, this contribution is important for the availability of these products in maintaining consumption needs in maintaining public health levels in the midst of an unfavourable situation for all parties, including sustainability of business in this chain network. However, the development of this commodity still has many obstacles, especially in the ability to provide high-quality products, resource capabilities and manage existing information, especially the farmers who are involved in cooperation in this supply chain system, so that it can impact their performance. This study explores the mediating effect of collaborative performance systems (CPS) in lateral collaboration structures such as; information sharing (ISH), resource sharing (RSH), contract farming (CTF) and join mode transportation (JTM) in individual companies (CIP) and supply chain performance (SPO) in the fresh produce supply chain (FPSC). The sample in this study was taken based on purposive sampling from the participation of respondents in the FPSC network consisting of farmers producing fresh vegetables and fruits who are members of the Association of the Farmers Groups (Gapoktan), distributors, owners of transportation modes and supermarkets. Respondents consisted of 72 people who had filled out complete questionnaires from their four supply chain channel partners. Data collection methods were analyzed using a structural equation approach. The results of the study that the mediation of CPS on the performance of CIP and SPO in the FPSC was confirmed.","Susanto E., Othman N.A., Rahayu S.T., Dzakiyullah N.R., Handayani E., Gunawan S., Hadiguna R.A.",Mediation effect of collaborative performance system on fresh produce supply chain performance with a lateral collaboration structure model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137355947&doi=10.5267%2fj.uscm.2022.8.012&partnerID=40&md5=2926a8b60c24cd4d74be54c094a981d8
Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Freshwater is crucial for food supply, as irrigation water and as production or incorporated water in industrial production of consumer goods (e.g. food, cosmetics). Manufacturing industries follow different protocols and receive different certifications for water management and efficiency in their plants, which are also labelled on the packaging. Nowadays, consumers appear to be increasingly concerned about environmental challenges, therefore many sustainability labels have been developed (carbon, water, ecological footprint) to facilitate consumers to make more sustainable choices concerning their purchases. Consumers’ behaviour towards carbon footprint labels has been thoroughly examined in international literature; however, WF labelling studies are very limited. The key to water efficiency labelling in consumer products could be the water footprint (WF), as it measures the total volume of freshwater used to produce a product, over the full supply chain, including virtual water, “hidden” in the products, services and processes. The implementation of WF labelling of consumer products in Greece was investigated, using a questionnaire with demographical data and statements on water sustainability. The results indicate that younger consumers are not quite aware of environmental challenges related to water. According to the findings, WF could be an effective marketing driver towards water sustainability since consumers prefer a quantified label concerning water consumption, regardless of their educational level, and they are willing to pay an extra price for water sustainable products even if they have an unstable job. Manufacturers could then promote their sustainable profile and performance effectively by adopting a WF relevant labelling.","Nydrioti I., Grigoropoulou H.",Using the water footprint concept for water use efficiency labelling of consumer products: the Greek experience,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139939125&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-022-23573-w&partnerID=40&md5=c07c55f0e53089f479ba9eee21f68573
Journal of Environmental Management,"From 2022, the European Union Waste Framework Directive (WFD) requires member states to report annual food waste from each food supply chain stage. Comprehensive food losses and waste (FLW) data can be challenging to obtain for the primary production stage, i.e., farming and fishing. However, this information is vital in developing FLW mitigation actions appropriate to each country. This study describes the nature and extent of FLW from primary production in Ireland, using methods approved for WFD reporting. Causes of FLW and FLW as a proportion of total production were determined through interviews with Irish primary production stakeholders and using national FLW data where available. The FLW was presented for each primary production sector - animal husbandry, horticulture, tillage, aquaculture, and fisheries. The total annual FLW from Irish primary production was 189,508 tonnes. The main FLW sources were vegetable production (122,398 tonnes), meat production (41,726 tonnes), and tillage (12,502 tonnes). The activities associated with high FLW did not reflect the quantity of food from those activities, e.g., dairy generated the greatest quantity of animal husbandry produce (89%) but only 7% of animal husbandry FLW. The main causes of FLW in Irish primary production were pests, disease, injuries, and production stress (37%), followed by un-harvestable or un-saleable produce, 24% and 21%, respectively. The majority of FLW described in this study (63%) is considered food loss, meaning mitigation efforts should focus on this rather than food waste. These results also clearly indicate priority areas for mitigation action, e.g., horticulture. This research suggests mitigation actions that improve long-term farm sustainability, e.g., improve soil health, reduce FLW and contribute to food production potential in fisheries and aquaculture.","O'Connor T., Kleemann R., Attard J.",Vulnerable vegetables and efficient fishers: A study of primary production food losses and waste in Ireland,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122916971&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.114498&partnerID=40&md5=ce279b3ee99744da64de2e0e0cadac4c
Waste Management,"From a sustainability perspective, the performance of a company's supply chain will be satisfactory when it has reached in all aspects a desirable eco-environmentally friendly level. Assessing the sustainability performance in the closed-loop e-waste supply chain becomes vital because its activities are primarily targeted towards sustainability goals related to the process of production, supply, recycling, and disposal of electrical components. This study evaluates the performance of e-waste supply chain sustainability and identifies its performance indicators as a framework for evaluating supply chain performance using the Best-Worst Method (BWM), which is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. For this, the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model is considered the basic performance evaluation reference. Moreover, through reviewing the literature, the complementary indicators of this model, especially in terms of sustainability, are added to the performance evaluation indices using the Nominal Group Technique (NGT). After specifying and forming a performance evaluation hierarchy, the BWM method is used to determine the criteria score. The results of implementing the framework on some well-known supply chains in New Zealand indicate that the attributes of “Costs,” “Quality,” and “GreenScor” are crucial for achieving high performance, while in this developed country, there is less concern about social issues.","Jain V., Kumar S., Mostofi A., Arab Momeni M.",Sustainability performance evaluation of the E-waste closed-loop supply chain with the SCOR model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130813871&doi=10.1016%2fj.wasman.2022.05.010&partnerID=40&md5=9c6b322594779cd2d9e58398eb14a62d
Polymer Composites,"From the environmental perspective, efficient plastic utilization and its recyclability become significant issues that need to be resolved for deploying urban and sustainable technologies. It is estimated that approximately 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year for different applications. This number will be doubled by 2050, which is a serious problem. The primary issue that arises in a recycling process is associated with optimum supply chain management. The comprehensive and transparent supply chain methodologies will help stockholders to make conclusive policies and precise strategies. Transparency in supply chain management assists in captivating planning, pricing, purchasing, and inventory management decisions. Environmental sustainability requires recycling, which should have innovative concepts like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Block-chain Technology. Manual methods of sorting and segregating the waste have outdated and not much efficient. The inclusion of AI and Blockchain Technology brought a revolution by increasing the efficiency and accuracy of the recycling process. This critical review focused on recycling plastics and plastic waste using AI and Blockchain Technology. Various plastic regulation policies and AI utilization for plastic recycling are discussed. An overview of the blockchain and its classification for waste management or plastic recycling has been discussed.

For this purpose, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is extended by integrating the Z numbers and rough fuzzy set theory into its computational procedure. Z-numbers address the uncertainty of the decision and experts’ confidence in the evaluation and rough numbers are used for aggregating the experts’ opinions. On this basis, the mutual influence of social innovation factors and the influence weights of these factors are investigated. The results suggest that a quick response to market demand for sustainable products is the most influential factor in attaining social sustainability innovation during the pandemic.

Frontiers in Nutrition,"Fruits and vegetables wastes (e.g., peel fractions, pulps, pomace, and seeds) represent ~16% of total food waste and contribute ~6% to global greenhouse gas emissions. The diversity of the fruit-horticultural production in several developing countries and the excess of certain fruits or vegetables in the months of greatest production offer unique opportunities for adding value to these wastes (co-products). Within the scope of the Circular Economy, valorization of such wastes for the production of innovative bio-ingredients can open great market opportunities if efficiently exploited. In this context, this review deals with the current situation of wastes arising from fruits and vegetables (availability, characterization) as sources of valuable ingredients (fiber, polyphenols, pigments) suitable to be incorporated into food, pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical products. In addition, an integral and systematic approach including the sustainable technologies generally used at both lab and industrial scale for efficient extraction of bioactive compounds from fruits and vegetables wastes are addressed. Overall, this review provides a general updated overview regarding the situation of fruits and vegetables chain supplies in the post-pandemic era, offering an integrative perspective that goes beyond the recovery of fiber and phytochemicals from the previous mentioned wastes and focuses on whole processes and in their social and economic impacts.

International Journal of Production Economics,"Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) represent one important pillar for transport low-carbon transition. While FCV supply chain has received growing attentions, its regional evolvement mechanism remains unclear, impeding the insights into future supply chain development and the measures needed to cope with possible challenges. To fill such a research gap, this study establishes a system dynamics model and forecasts the evolvement of regional FCV supply chain by taking China as the example. The results show that with peak annual demands for vehicle-use fuel cells of China growing to 350–600 GW in the coming decades, the country will likely face the challenges of high import dependence (>50%) on upstream advanced technology commodities, uncertain degree of FCV market penetration and a huge annual platinum demand up to 86 t. To cope with these challenges and improve the FCV supply chain sustainability, China needs to enhance industrial competitiveness in the upstream supply chain with priority, prepare the whole FCV supply chain in a highly elastic way, and reduce the dependence on imported platinum by improving the end-of-life recycling rates of platinum and increasing imports of platinum-containing scraps. With proper measures taken, China's FCV supply chain has the potential to evolve in a sustainable way and support the low-carbon transition of the transport sector.","Xun D., Hao H., Sun X., Geng J., Liu Z., Zhao F.",Modeling the evolvement of regional fuel cell vehicle supply chain: Implications for enhancing supply chain sustainability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131452290&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108535&partnerID=40&md5=bce058f00c46b0f3a8b95426bd533f34
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Future trends in sustainable food consumption include the emergence of short food supply chains and growing interest in local food products. Among the drivers are the more urgent sustainability expectations, the emphasis on environmental and social responsibility, and the changing consumer needs, of which the desire for healthy and quality products, curiosity, uniqueness, and experience are the most prominent drivers. Today’s customers are becoming more aware and open to culinary discoveries and exotic delights. In this study, we investigated the importance of product attributes related to local products, and the motivational factors that determine purchase intentions. The significance of our work lies in the fact that we have studied young consumers’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors. A quantitative consumer survey was conducted using a hybrid data collection method on a sample of 1756 respondents aged between 18 and 45 years. The questionnaire focused on product features, intrinsic and extrinsic motivational elements, and demographic characteristics. The results of our study provide strong evidence that the features associated with local products include but are not limited to the following: freshness, high quality, nutritional value, reliability, safety, evoking domestic flavours, naturalness, being healthy, environmentally friendly, etc. The motivational elements were grouped into four factors: hedonism, curiosity, nutritional value, and tradition. The main reasons for young respondents purchasing local food were taste and curiosity. Based on the results of the cluster analysis, we formed three groups having different features and different motivations for purchasing local products. Moreover, we had the opportunity to understand the attitudes and perceptions of young people towards buying local products. A key result of our study is that the “value-creators” segment considers local products to be healthy and nutritious.","Kovács I., Lendvai M.B., Beke J.",The Importance of Food Attributes and Motivational Factors for Purchasing Local Food Products: Segmentation of Young Local Food Consumers in Hungary,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126301145&doi=10.3390%2fsu14063224&partnerID=40&md5=287f56706709af8d0ac4adbfc774b54d
Forest Policy and Economics,"Galicia is a region situated in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula where community forests are very much spread. This kind of ownership is held by local communities that, collectively, decide how to manage the forest and its mycological resources as part of its non-timber forest products. In this work, we characterize and analyse the existing governance modalities for the collective use of mycological resources in both their material and immaterial aspects, and we do it by applying a social-ecological system framework combined with a knowledge economy model. Up to 21 mycological use initiatives have been identified and inventoried. Most of them manage the common resource through mycological reserves (open or closed), but there are others that produce and sell mushrooms. The work shows how communities use their governance mechanisms to define rules aimed at improving sustainability and the influx of revenues. In addition, we analyse how some of these initiatives are starting to manage their common immaterial resources (associated with values such as quality and with eco-certifications, etc.), and to develop innovative strategies (short supply chains) for the purpose of improving their position in the value chain. The text discusses community management as a strategy that allows combining sustainability objectives in the management of mycological resources with the raising of revenues in the long term.

Expert Systems with Applications,"Generally, Home Health Care (HHC) consists of a medical team that serves patients in their own homes and carries out various medical services, such as taking biological samples and administering medicine. Aging trends in developing countries, and the growing tendency of the elderly to receive healthcare services in their own homes, leads to increasing demand for such services that outgrow those available in hospitals, healthcare personnel, and other resources. Therefore, HHC services and their associate demand rates are increasing dramatically. A major opportunity normally ignored in this regard is the applicability of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems to facilitate this practice. In this work, a two-phased approach is proposed to 1) identify the potential patients and 2) collect their biological samples and send them to be analyzed. Green Split Pick-up Vehicle Routing Problem (GSPVRP) and IoT concept are employed to address the patients in both sub-models. The proposed model is investigated by data from a real-world case study in Montreal, Canada, and solved using four multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms.

Journal of Industrial Ecology,"Given the fast-growing demand for electric mobility, the European Union (EU) has invested in responsible sourcing of battery raw materials, but the sustainability of their value chains is not fully addressed. Life cycle sustainability assessment is a tool to identify social, economic, and environmental aspects of raw materials, but it is mostly used for negative impacts, whereas the supply and use of raw materials may also lead to benefits. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help to determine how raw materials boost or hinder the achievement of a sustainable society. In this study, the SDGs were used as a reference to assess contributions and risks of cobalt supply for electric mobility in the EU and whether this technology supports the achievement of the SDGs. The risks were determined using eight indicators focused on social risks, but environmental aspects like water quality and usage, and greenhouse gas emissions were also considered. The literature and databases were consulted to identify which SDGs receive contributions or burdens. Global and European cobalt supply scenarios were defined, considering the most representative countries. Results indicate that, although some SDGs receive positive contributions, like SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) and SDG 13 (Climate action), most of the identified correlations are negative, especially for SDG 3 (Good health and well-being) and SDG 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions).

Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,"Given the requirements of international businesses, this research addresses the supply chain network design problem in the real-world situation by considering four critical features: sustainability, resiliency, responsiveness, and globalization. For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical model is proposed that minimizes the environmental impacts and the total costs and maximizes the social impacts while considering the resilience and responsiveness of the global supply chain. Then, the modified fuzzy robust stochastic method is employed to tackle the uncertainty.

"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Global demand for buildings and infrastructure is extremely high as provision of shelter, sanitation and healthcare are paramount to safeguard the world's growing population. Concrete is a preferred construction material to meet this demand, but its production is leading to overexploitation of natural gravel and sand, causing an environmental crisis in regions where these materials are extracted unsustainably. Waste concrete is available globally, particularly in regions with fast growth of the built environment, and those struck by coordinated attacks, earthquakes or severe weather events. Waste concrete has mainly been used for producing recycled aggregates; however, its full recycling is still not practiced. Alternative uses include applications as fine recycled aggregates, supplementary cementitious materials, filler, and feedstocks for clinker production. These technologies still face challenges concerning their adoption and eco-efficiency. Restricted knowledge and operational barriers have also prevented implementation of beneficiation technologies for complete re-recycling of waste concretes, particularly the fine fractions produced during crushing. Despite these issues, it is recognised that the complete utilization of waste concrete offers unique opportunities for supply chain security, reducing natural resources consumption and enabling to move towards a Circular Economy. Harmonizing current practices for the treatment of waste concrete and the by-products generated during their processing, is a first step toward policy and standards development to enable their widespread use. This critical discussion addresses challenges and opportunities, as well as facilitation strategies needed to progress the complete re-utilization of waste concrete as a valuable resource for creating sustainable future infrastructure.","Villagrán-Zaccardi Y.A., Marsh A.T.M., Sosa M.E., Zega C.J., De Belie N., Bernal S.A.",Complete re-utilization of waste concretes–Valorisation pathways and research needs,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117410234&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2021.105955&partnerID=40&md5=749b28fa6a7f0da4f0a01a24e3d10f28
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Global e-commerce sales are growing rapidly adding complexities to their supply chains. There are an increasing trend of product returns along with the growth of global e-commerce platforms, placing a huge significance on reverse logistics management. E-commerce being a competitive industry, factors such as environmental concerns, customer awareness, and legal pressure have led the firms to pay attention to the circular economy and sustainability concepts while managing their reverse logistics. Considering the above factors, this paper proposes a three-stage, circular reverse logistics framework for handling e-commerce returns. We introduce a novel method of applying ward-like hierarchical clustering with geographical constraints on returns data to identify return patterns as the first stage. As the second stage, a circular economy network was introduced among different parties to commit towards the circular economy. We develop a mixed integer linear programming model upon the above circular economy network in the third stage to capture different facets of the reverse logistics in e-commerce and optimize the network. At the final stage, the model is validated with a case study based on an e-commerce firm engaged in consumer electrical and electronics. The decision support system which is an output of this study will help the decision makers in e-commerce firms to embrace circular economy and optimize the reverse logistics network, while handling product returns.","Nanayakkara P.R., Jayalath M.M., Thibbotuwawa A., Perera H.N.",A circular reverse logistics framework for handling e-commerce returns,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136482891&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2022.100080&partnerID=40&md5=de7122971500b20d0477c9f03b82baa3

Technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain facilitate more robust supply chain operations, such as remanufacturing, just-in-time production, and automated workflow, leading to corporate sustainability along economic, environmental, and social dimensions. From a dynamic capability perspective, this article conceptualizes emerging IT capability and investigates its role in helping enterprises survive supply chain disruptions and prosper in the long run. A research model depicts the relationships among environmental uncertainty, supply chain vulnerability vigilance, emerging IT capability, supply chain resilience, and corporate sustainability. A partial least square analysis on survey observations collected from more than 200 enterprises in China that are highly susceptible to supply chain disruptions provides supporting evidence to most research hypotheses. The results show that high vigilance to potential supply chain disruptions will motivate enterprises to develop emerging IT capability, which will enhance supply chain resilience as well as economic, environmental, and social performances. The mediating role of emerging IT capability suggests a viable path for enterprises to adapt to the increasingly turbulent environment and improve supply chain resilience and corporate sustainability.

Food Webs,"Global fisheries and seafood supply chains have remarkable structural similarities to nature's food webs, with humans as apex predators, allowing us to use ecological concepts to draw connections between fisheries management and the stability and resilience of the global seafood system. However, misinformation currently plagues the global seafood market and may be preventing food webs' natural stabilizing features from working properly in the seafood system. We argue that misinformation blocks transparency throughout the entire supply chain and prevents consumers from making informed and potentially stabilizing decisions, undermining the sustainability of the global seafood system. Here, we first describe how food webs contain a remarkably repeated generalist module, characterized by flexible mobile generalist predators that adapt to resource variability in space by making rapid and “informed” foraging switches. Next, we discuss how the global seafood system mimics this structure but opposes the common stabilizing mechanism of nature's food webs because it is replete with misinformation. We conclude that modern tools combined with proper labelling can help create high information markets that allow consumers to make rapid and informed decisions. Predators' roles in nature's food webs indicate that smart switches in consumer foraging (i.e., demand) are critical for global seafood sustainability and the maintenance of marine biodiversity.","Bieg C., Bartley T.J., McCann K.S., Hanner R.H.",Replicating nature's fabric: High information markets and the sustainability of global seafood,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130398883&doi=10.1016%2fj.fooweb.2022.e00239&partnerID=40&md5=e5763e969ba547cdd0b7501fb9b5f0ea
Marine Policy,"Global initiatives indicate that nations wish to monitor changes in the economic, environmental, and social values when managing their national assets, including their oceans, for the future. Ocean accounting is developing to meet this future challenge. Since the Law of the Sea Convention (1984), valuations of ocean economies have gradually adopted the System of National Accounts to measure productive activity, while recognising it's deficiencies in valuing environmental capital and flows. The System of Environmental-Economic Accounts has been accessed to capture the contributions of the environment via ecosystem goods and services. Recently ocean accounting has developed into an integrated monetary and physical environmental accounting framework for the oceans. Ocean accounts also have the potential to include contextual social and cultural information, though like the inclusion of environment, this may take time to achieve. However we observe that critical accounting, now accepted in mainstream accounting, has not previously been applied to this emerging field. Critical accounting asks fundamental questions of ‘accounting for what?’ and ‘accounting for whom?’ It is proposed that this alternative perspective can contribute to the development and emergence of a more accountable and inclusive ocean accounting framework contributing to areas that ocean governance has found problematic, such as sustainability, subsidies, transnational crime, including illegal fishing and slave labour in supply chains. A future for ocean accounting that is relevant to effective ocean governance, will need more than just numbers.","Perkiss S., McIlgorm A., Nichols R., Lewis A.R., Lal K.K., Voyer M.",Can critical accounting perspectives contribute to the development of ocean accounting and ocean governance?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122518538&doi=10.1016%2fj.marpol.2021.104901&partnerID=40&md5=d22dac3acce4205a5e3d68512341c8d3
Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment,"Global supply networks encompass many inter-connected suppliers. Many of these suppliers are unpredictable and beyond the direct realm of the company, making the management of sustainability a difficult task. This research attempts to put forth a profound exploration of the integration of sustainability across complex multi-tier supply networks through the utilization of blockchain technology. The research includes a selected literature review compromising well-cited research that focuses on multi-tier supply networks and blockchain technology. The findings suggest that blockchain can enhance suppliers’ visibility. Managers will have increased transparency and traceability of their global supply networks, which will eventually reduce information asymmetry and limit opportunistic behaviors. Furthermore, the connectivity and rapid/immutable sustainable information sharing features associated with blockchain increase suppliers’ predictability and create robust sustainable supply networks.

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Global sustainability movement encourages companies to adopt and implement green supply chain management (GSCM) practices across the organization. Moreover, the integration of green practices into traditional supply chain is still to be a difficult task in manufacturing sector. However, empirical studies regarding the identification of influential factors affecting GSCM adoption among supply chain managers in manufacturing sector are under researched. This study assesses the factors affecting GSCM adoption in Jordan manufacturing firms. A well-structured questionnaire was administered for data collection. A valid 376 responses were collected from different manufacturing firms in Jordan. The data were analyzed, and the proposed model was validated using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Results reveal that four factors, namely, supplier, environmental, customer, and cost factors significantly influence the intention to adopt GSCM among managers. The firm size had significantly moderated the relationship between market/financial and GSCM adoption, internal factor and GSCM adoption. The study will help the policymakers to understand the drivers of GSCM adoption among managers and assist them in implementing GSCM practices according to the size of the firm.

Resources Policy,"Global transitions to electric vehicles (EVs) have triggered a surge in demand for the required minerals, whose extraction impacts raise questions on the overall sustainability of EVs. The impacts of mineral extraction are usually invisible to consumers who are at the relative end of EV-minerals’ life cycle, posing a challenge for the governance of minerals. Due to their increasingly important role in motivating corporate response, understanding consumers' perceptions is crucial to inform efforts towards sustainable mineral extraction (SME), which encompasses the actions, policies, and practices to minimize environmental and social impacts of minerals extractions. In this study, we applied the telecoupling framework and combined a survey and Q-method to examine how EV consumers perceive the life-cycle developments of EV, impacts of minerals extraction, and potential governance schemes. Our analysis identified and discussed the nuanced categories of perceptions and their implications. Overall, there is a general lack of awareness of impacts among respondents, but most respondents recognized the complexity in the supply chain of EVs and the role of consumers in influencing its governance. Contradictory opinions are widely found, reflecting the tensions and conflicts between the imperative of energy transitions and the reality of adverse mining impacts. Improved SME governance should consider the differences in consumers’ purchase motivations when mobilizing for changes, and not detract from the positive roles of EVs. We also highlight the need for a telecoupling view in mineral governance and suggest a shift in the EV supply chain to include broader sustainable development goals and a global community of consumers, affected communities, and the general public.","Liu W., Agusdinata D.B., Eakin H., Romero H.",Sustainable minerals extraction for electric vehicles: A pilot study of consumers’ perceptions of impacts,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121432177&doi=10.1016%2fj.resourpol.2021.102523&partnerID=40&md5=b8431cdd670b417a0b56a159d93f7dc2
Ecosystem Services,"Global understanding of the interconnections between the environment and economy has increased, driving the development of frameworks and standards that support the measurement and valuation of natural capital and ecosystem services by both governments and businesses. This paper outlines how businesses can use natural capital accounts (NCA) aligned to the System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) standard described in this special issue to support identification, management, and valuation of natural capital not typically listed on corporate balance sheets. Such accounts have direct applications for business strategic planning, investment decisions, supply chain management, operations management, risk management, and corporate reporting. Businesses also have important roles to play in advancing SEEA-aligned NCA by providing information that would be useful to include in the accounts and by helping to shape accounts to provide decision-relevant information for both the private and the public sectors. Current pilot SEEA-aligned NCA data and analyses developed for the United States can help address some of the common challenges that businesses face in using natural capital data such as accessibility, quality, and credibility, important for business decision making. However, improvements are needed to fill data gaps and produce more frequent and timely estimates aligned to the temporal resolution needed by businesses.","Ingram J.C., Bagstad K.J., Vardon M., Rhodes C.R., Posner S., Casey C.F., Glynn P.D., Shapiro C.D.",Opportunities for businesses to use and support development of SEEA-aligned natural capital accounts,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134006426&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoser.2022.101434&partnerID=40&md5=ba21c6af560f76e74a96c4de32e0943a
Mathematical Problems in Engineering,"Global warming and environmental pollution are concepts that are more or less encountered in the news and newspapers today. Protecting the environment is crucial to the survival of humanity and the many plant and animal species that inhabit the planet. Lack of control of greenhouse gases can increase the average surface temperature and lead to floods and serious damage in the near future. On the other hand, overproduction of plastics by factories can lead to environmental pollution and the destruction of many food cycles on Earth. In this study, in order to sustainability integrate issues in supply chain network design decisions, a multiobjective optimization model is presented, which is a two-level routing location problem and optimizes economic and environmental goals. The first level is decisions related to the selection of operating facilities from a set of potential facilities (manufacturers and distribution centers), and the second level is related to determining the number of products from distribution centers to retailers and from manufacturers to distribution centers. The objective function is also of the minimization type, which is related to minimizing fixed and variable costs, and minimizing the environmental effects of the whole chain, which includes reducing the costs of greenhouse gas and carbon emissions.","Zarean Dowlat Abadi J., Iraj M., Bagheri E., Rabieipakdeh Z., Dehghani Tafti M.R.",A Multiobjective Multiproduct Mathematical Modeling for Green Supply Chain considering Location-Routing Decisions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131430221&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f7009338&partnerID=40&md5=cda0de36b57cefab113fdf51f8f11221
International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Global warming and e-waste pollution are two major environmental pollution issues that have attracted widespread attention. The government has adopted various measures to reduce carbon emissions from businesses and to make manufacturers responsible for recycling e-waste. In the face of external pressures, more and more companies are implementing sustainable closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) management to reduce environmental pollution and achieve sustainable development. Therefore, it is essential to study the operational decisions of CLSC enterprises. This paper considers a sustainable CLSC consisting of two competing manufacturers and a dominant retailer. The government imposes a carbon tax on the retailer, and two manufacturers collect used products directly from their customers. We separately examine whether implementing green marketing by the retailer and the collaboration between the two manufacturers can improve their profits. By building decentralized CLSC mathematical models and applying game theory methods, we obtain that green marketing can increase profits for all CLSC members and improve return rates. The collaboration may yield higher total profits for two manufacturers than a decentralized solution, while the retailer’s profits may be lost under certain conditions. Finally, we perform several numerical analyses to find the relationship between unit carbon emission tax and social welfare and gain some managerial insights. The study gives key factors that CLSC companies should consider when making decisions to help them achieve sustainability and provides recommendations for the government to set a reasonable unit carbon tax.","Lyu S., Chen Y., Wang L.",Optimal Decisions in a Multi-Party Closed-Loop Supply Chain Considering Green Marketing and Carbon Tax Policy,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136341065&doi=10.3390%2fijerph19159244&partnerID=40&md5=5afe929afcc3bf0d0dbf8e38893cf064
Annals of Operations Research,"Global warming, climate change, and social problems are the worst human-induced sustainability issues that economies across the globe have witnessed. Water pollution, greenhouse effect, poor working conditions, child labour and lack of coordination among channel partners have caused the considerable interruptions in the supply chain network. The purpose of the paper is to identify critical factors affecting behavioural and sustainable supply chain coordination and evaluate strategies for risk reduction in the supply chain coordination in the context of digitization. This study purposes a novel supply chain coordination framework which consists of four themes such as system, actor, objective and action on which the success or the failure of supply chain can be contingent. Our study integrates multi-criteria decision approach using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP) and Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Fuzzy-DEMATEL) to investigate factors that affected the behavioural and sustainable supply chain coordination in the context of digitization. The Fuzzy-AHP method qualified to hierarchically rank the factors based on the relative fuzzy weightage while Fuzzy-DEMATEL established the inter-relationships among the factors and classified them into cause and effect groups. The findings of our study identified the Environmental performance and decarbonization as the most significant factor and the speed to market as the least important factor in developing behavioural and sustainable supply chain coordination in the context of digitization. Our analysis from Fuzzy AHP-DEMATEL approach reveal that the social preferences (power balance, reciprocity, fairness) is a significant causal factor which can effectively abolish the issues plaguing behavioural and sustainable supply chain coordination in the context of digitization.

This is especially due to the fact that national boundaries do not limit the flow of investment capital, labour, goods, or the environmental consequences of such activities. In parallel, the evolution of sustainable development has brought with it social, environmental, and economic activities for the benefit of future generations. The 2030 Agenda reflects the notion of sustainable development with 17 individual goals and 169 targets. While many welcomed such development, enforceability of sustainable development goals (SDGs) remains a challenge, primarily as voluntarism is central to the system of SDGs. In theory, consumers and end-user companies opt for sustainably produced goods to contribute towards sustainable development in their own countries and other countries in global value chains. In the absence of a national or international binding regulatory framework, contract emerged as the most effective solution for enforcing the SDGs in global value chains.

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Globally, vaccination plays a vital role in controlling the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the cold supply chain is essential for vaccine storage and logistics services. In a country like India, the last-mile logistics of vaccines is a challenging task. The cold chain is indispensable for the Covid-19 vaccine drive to the rural areas. The demand for cold storage increases rapidly due to the rapid Covid-19 vaccine drive. The conventional cold storage facility has a more significant threat to the grid power quality and environmental impacts. The energy demand and greenhouse gas emission of traditional cold storage lead to global warming. The micro cold storage facility has to be developed rapidly to accelerate the vaccine drive to the last mile of the county with reliable and affordable energy sources. In addition, climate change mitigation is ensured by the renewable energy utilization in the Covid-19 vaccine drive. The proposed novel micro cold storage aims to be silent, clean, mobile, without moving parts, and reliable for the last-mile vaccine logistics as a vaccine carrier to the remote rural areas. This paper deals with the novel design, development, and experimental investigation of solar photovoltaic powered thermoelectric-based micro cold storage as a Covid-19 vaccine carrier for rural areas.

Brazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Goal: The supply chain sustainability (SCS) literature is missing studies that specifically analyse factors that impact sustainability performance in supply chains, according to specific theoretical backgrounds. Within this context, this paper aims to understand how and why social capital theory (SCT) can inspire SCS studies and practice. In doing so, two research questions are addressed: (1) How has the SCS literature evolved in its application of the social capital theory?, and (2) What are the main sustainability performance factors studied in SCS?. Design/Methodology/Approach: A systematic literature review was developed. Data were collected from 12 years (2008–2019) in two databases (i.e. EBSCO and Web of Science) and a total of 56 articles were selected and analysed through deductive and inductive content analysis. Results: The analysis revealed 24 performance factors that influence SCS research throughout the three sustainability dimensions (i.e. economic, environmental and social). We found that social capital makes a significant conceptual contribution to understanding how the supply chain practices (i.e. cooperation, coordination, collaboration, resource exchanges and information sharing) explain how relationships are formed and interrelated to improve SCS performance. Limitations of the investigation: The use of two databases may present limited results, which may have resulted in missing publications.

Applied Soft Computing,"Governmental limitations and customer expectations have increased the focus on sustainability in supply chain network design (SCND). To address this issue, a bi-objective mixed-integer mathematical model is introduced with the aim of simultaneously maximizing supply chain profit and minimizing overall carbon emissions. Additionally, customer demands are considered price- and greenness-sensitive for multiple products, and uncertainty in the production process is estimated by a finite number of scenarios. The Monte Carlo sampling approach is used to produce the initial scenarios, and a heuristic scenario reduction approach is subsequently utilized. Due to the complexity of the model, we develop a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that embeds variable neighborhood search (VNS) in two genetic algorithms to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm to high-quality solutions. These algorithms are compared to multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) with two leader selection procedures. To improve the performance of these algorithms, the response surface method is applied to modulate the algorithm parameters.

Research into information sharing for the circular economy mainly focuses on using ICT to follow entire products, such as digital product passports. However, research into information sharing for reuse flows and monitoring at the level of materials is limited so far. Therefore, in this paper, we derive the following requirements for information sharing to support the monitoring of materials and CRMs in particular: 1) businesses and government organisations should have access to the complete history of materials; 2) businesses should be able to share information on materials between different supply chains and industries; 3) information on materials should be reliable and tamper-resistant; 4) governments should be able to obtain a complete overview of the pool of CRMs in circulation and of who is responsible for them; 5) the system supporting the information sharing on materials should be highly robust and should not have a single locus of control.

"International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics","Green building is an innovative and socially significant element of enhancing environmental sustainability. The main idea behind the construction of green buildings is to increase the sustainability of the living environment, which is achieved by reducing the overall impact of buildings on the environment and human health. This undoubtedly important trend, entering into modern use and closely related to the concept of sustainable development, makes it necessary to determine what lies at the basis of its international legal regulation. The purpose of the study is to determine the place and role of international legal instruments for the formation of ""green"" construction and processes, related to it. The Aarhus Convention, as one of these instruments, provides dual protections for environmental and human rights, and its focus on public engagement provides a mechanism to ensure that governments are held accountable in their efforts to address the multifaceted challenges facing our world today. At the same time, the second one—the UN Global Compact—is the world's largest corporate social responsibility initiative and also directly affects the status of implementation of many modern instruments aimed at achieving sustainable development in national legal systems. Research question: What is the role of the UN Global Compact and the Aarhus Convention in stimulating green building in Russia at the present stage? Through the method of political and legal analysis used in the work, the study attempts to determine the role of the mentioned international regulatory legal acts in the field of environmental protection as a tool to stimulate green building. The study is based on the assumption that international environmental agreements have the necessary levers to influence green building, and their effective application is in the public interest. The study is based on the example of the Russian legal system in a comparative perspective. This paper discusses the impact of international instruments such as the Aarhus Convention and the United Nations Global Compact on promoting green building, the sustainable development of the construction industry and the relationship between sustainability and competitiveness when using green supply chain management (GSCM). The study gives reasons to say about the contradictory attitude of the Russian authorities to the initiative to join the Aarhus Convention, but at the same time confirms the interest of Russian business in adherence to the goals of the UN Global Compact; however, it demonstrates the fact that the issue of forming sustained commitment to the concept of green construction directly for the construction business at this stage is not among the top priorities. In this area, commitment to the principles of the UN Global Compact is in its infancy. In practical terms, the work is of interest both for business entities for assessing the commercial profitability of business processes and for policymakers in the field of adapting domestic legislative acts to international legislation and law enforcement practices.","Liu Z.-J., Snezhko V., Kurilova A.",International legal instruments for stimulating green building and construction business: Russian case study,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113790282&doi=10.1007%2fs10784-021-09548-1&partnerID=40&md5=e1bfd8e54ea79bf88338e84675729004
Nanotechnology for Environmental Engineering,"Green chemistry and nano-engineering are aimed at increasing products efficiencies in the chemical supply chain and reducing health and environmental hazards. This study stresses how principles and measurements of green chemistry can affect, from design through disposal, the complete life cycle of a chemical. Nanotechnology, as a rapidly developing field, provides an educational framework for investigating the influence and implementation of Green Chemistry in the real world. Both are propelled by a wide range of inventiveness, and both are intended to usher in a new era of technological advancement. In this paper, the application and impact of modern green technologies, as well as future potential for transdisciplinary interaction, are discussed. The 12 Green Chemistry Principles, initially published in 1998, give a framework accepted by not only chemists, but also designers and policymakers. The implementation of the principles was prompted by decades of inadvertent environmental harm and the effects on human health from chemical production and use of dangerous chemicals. But the principles for the synthesis and manufacture of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are employed for more than decades. Even while the entire scientific community promotes advancements in nanotechnology, there remain considerable research gaps and a possibility for safe, responsive application of ENMs’ great economic, social and environmental benefits. In the context of the notion of the ‘Green Economy’, the social relationship and economic between the environment and economy can be properly managed.

Frontiers in Environmental Science,"Green construction procurement is a part of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) that influence economic growth on a strategic level. Adopting green technologies and practices has no longer been an option but a well-worth route for gaining a competitive advantage in the construction sector. The emergent concepts of green procurement and sustainability have raised the need to measure the financial performances in supply chain practices. Green procurement is now gaining importance in the construction industry and supply chain practices for a safer tomorrow. The study aimed to investigate the impact of construction procurement on green logistic services, innovation practices, and their subsequent role in gaining sustainable economic development goals. The population frame for this study was the project teams (engineers and project managers) of construction companies in China. The sampling design followed was convenient random sampling. The study was conducted using self-administered questionnaire surveys to avoid any respondent biases and/or errors. The study's findings show that construction procurement is partially associated with green logistic services management, which thoroughly determines the sustainable economic development goals. Furthermore, construction procurement is found to have a significant impact on green innovation practices that partially predict the SDGs, and the mediation of green logistic services and innovation practices are partially mediated to the construction procurement and sustainable goals. In the future, the study results will help the construction practitioners, contractors, bidders, and engineering community to shape their relationships in a greener way up or down the stream of their supply chains. Additionally, the implication of green procurement and logistic services offers many challenges in the long run for attaining SDGs; however, in the short run, it gives operational efficiency and less hazardous environmental emissions.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"Green innovation could become a valuable firm resource for establishing competitive advantage while simultaneously contributing towards sustainable development; in other words, green innovation has the potential to address the dilemma between consuming available resources and preserving them for the future. However, there is a dearth of studies systematically examining the present structure and future scope of research on green innovation as a firm resource. Seeking to explain the sustainable development dilemma of green innovations through the theoretical perspective of the resource-based view of the firm, we address this gap with a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 951 relevant articles. The key contributors to the extant literature are recognised with bibliographic coupling, citation analysis and co-authorship analysis. A co-citation analysis identifies four major thematic areas of research: green supply chain management, green product design, corporate environmental responsibilities and social sustainability. Further, a dynamic co-citation analysis tracks the progression of these thematic areas. Content analysis of the thematic areas provides insights into the status of the research domain. This study also contributes to the extant literature by identifying prestigious articles on green innovation as a firm resource, analysing the co-occurrence of keywords and suggesting future research agendas.","Khanra S., Kaur P., Joseph R.P., Malik A., Dhir A.",A resource-based view of green innovation as a strategic firm resource: Present status and future directions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122095586&doi=10.1002%2fbse.2961&partnerID=40&md5=b5ff351312c8bb2c9384f9713a9140e3
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Green purchasing in green supply chain management (GSCM) literature plays an essential role in achieving carbon neutrality by seeking to eliminate CO2 emissions. Single organizations would, however, not aim at such a goal if it is to their economic detriment. GSCM research streams highlight that the successful implementation of environmental considerations leads to better economic performance in the long term. Therefore, this paper aims to identify and analyze suppliers that exhibit both environmental and economic success, indicating an effective and efficient realization of their sustainability measures. Given the long-term horizon of the research problem, we differentiate from previous microeconomic research by taking a macro perspective on sustainable supplier analysis, which investigates macroeconomic indicators focusing on firms' revenues. The above-described economic and environmental efficiency is analyzed in a multiple case study using sustainability reports from 66 OEM suppliers as well as data on their revenues and ratings on their carbon pollution measured by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). First, a text mining inspired quantitative sustainable SWOT analysis is performed to evaluate the long-term strategy of organizations. A subsequent data envelopment analysis aims to identify efficient suppliers and causes for their efficiency. The overall results not only outline sustainable suppliers but also give insights into suppliers that may become sustainable in the future. We further show that large organizations struggle with meeting environmental expectations, whereas low-to-medium-sized suppliers tend to be more economically and environmentally efficient. Based on the results, we discuss implications both for management research and practice.","Bodendorf F., Dimitrov G., Franke J.",Analyzing and evaluating supplier carbon footprints in supply networks,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137158376&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.133601&partnerID=40&md5=b1b5a626741a34b05021ad76d35ed558
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Green supply chain management (GSCM) has a necessary goal of performing a firm’s social and environmental responsibilities, and SMEs employ GSCM practices with constrained resources. SMEs need to determine which areas they need to concentrate their limited resources to result in positively noticeable economic outcomes. This study aims to identify what GSCM practices would influence economic and business profitability for first-tier suppliers in the electronics industry. Specifically, this examines whether internal environmental management (IEM), green purchasing (GP), cooperation with customers (CC), and eco-design (ECO) have a role in enhancing an organization’s economic performance (ECP) and business performance (BP). Survey data from 193 South Korean electronics firms were collected to test the proposed model. The survey responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of the present study showed that IEM, CC, and ECO of the responding SMEs had direct positive influences on ECP. Moreover, economic performance has a statistically significant influence on BP. However, GP did not show a significant relationship with ECP.

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Green supply chain management (GSCM) is an important part of most production organisations in developed countries. Meanwhile, developing countries are yet to fully embrace the concept. This study, therefore, investigated the drivers of GSCM using a close-up approach in a leading manufacturing organisation in Nigeria with sustainability initiatives. One hundred and fifty-four questionnaires retrieved from the supply chain management team of the organisation were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics such as mean score, standard deviation, and factor analysis. Based on the results of the analyses, the drivers of GSCM in the organisation could be grouped as government-related, organisational-related, and societal-related drivers. The study concluded that synergy of the government, organisations, non-government organisations, and individual is important for achieving green supply chain practices in developing countries.

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Green supply chain management (GSCM) plays the primary and a very important role for attaining the mission of sustainable development. Sustainability through GSCM is an evolving practice generic from the synthesis of two pertinent contemporary regenerative strategies. They are economic development and environmental protection. Accordingly, the concept of Sustainable Green Supply Chain Management (SGSCM) can be well understood as a corporate strategy for enhancing productivity and eco-efficiency. This paper aims to analyse the critical success factors (CSFs) for effective adoption of SGSCM practices in the Indian brass manufacturing industry—an important sector of the economy. Nine CSFs were selected from an extensive literature search that is validated through an exploratory survey of a sample of 189 management professionals. The analyses have been carried out by applications of AHP, TOPSIS and DEMATEL methods. This research showed general agreement with the existing literature on the factors that contribute to the successful implementation of SGSCM. However, although leadership is frequently mentioned in the literature, no guidance could be found on prioritization of success factors. It is established that top management commitment is the most important critical success factor, and reverse logistics management happens to be the most important cause for the effective adoption of SGSCM practices.","Agrawal V., Mohanty R.P., Agarwal S., Dixit J.K., Agrawal A.M.",Analyzing critical success factors for sustainable green supply chain management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129883476&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-022-02396-2&partnerID=40&md5=1352d9219a37ac5c98eaf0924df19f77
Vestnik Sankt-Peterburgskogo Universiteta. Ekonomika,"Green supply chain management has gained significant interest in recent years; however, we still have limited understanding of specific characteristics of different industries. The aim of this paper is to characterize the pharmaceutical supply chains from an environmental perspective. Our methodology provides a novel contribution to the literature describing green supply chain management, since no detailed analysis of the environmental aspects of the pharmaceutical industry has been carried out this way. Our results can inform pharmaceutical businesses and policymakers about the limiting factors of green supply chain management in the pharmaceutical sector and provide insights to overcome hindrances and to design new tools. By looking at the supply chains of the pharmaceutical sector, we demonstrate that the potentials of green supply chain management may be limited by several factors. First, the relationship between pharmaceutical substance suppliers and medicinal product manufacturers is characterized by long-term partnerships and strong interdependence. Second, interviews suggest that consumers neither have environmental expectations towards medicinal products, nor act in an environmentally conscious manner regarding the disposal of medicinal products. Third, our findings on actual environmental measures implemented by companies suggests that the specific characteristics of pharmaceutical supply chains, such as strict quality and health requirements, impose severe limitations on the greening of supply chains. This study builds on the analysis of the international literature, through which it presents the issues of green supply chains in the pharmaceutical industry.

A hybrid framework based on fuzzy step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (F-SWARA) and fuzzy weighted aggregated sum product assessment (F-WASPAS) is being developed to achieve the goal. According to the results, environmental rules and regulations, green organisational practices, supplier- and customer-related practices, green product and production practices, and green logistics practices are the GSCP’s main criteria in the order of its significance. According to the data, the top SPIs include better professional ethics, elimination/mitigation of environmental effects and societal dangers, cost savings on fines for environmental accidents, improved product quality with customer happiness, and increased productivity. The proposed method and methodology for assessing the GSCPs and SPIs simultaneously is new, and the data from an Indian manufacturing organisation also adds value to existing knowledge.

It can be either through adopting Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) or with existing conventional fossil fuel vehicles in fleets. GVRP also takes into account environmental sustainability in transportation and logistics. We critically review several variations and specializations of GVRP to address issues related to charging, pick-up, delivery, and energy consumption. Starting with the concepts and definitions of GVRP, we summarize the key elements and contributors to GVRP publications. Afterward, the issues regarding each category of green vehicle routing are reviewed, based on which key future research directions and challenges are suggested. It was observed that the main focus of previous publications is on the operational level routing decision and not the supply chain issues. The majority of publications used metaheuristic methods, while overlooking the emerging machine learning methods. We envision that in addition to machine learning, reinforcement learning, distributed systems, internet of vehicles (IoV), and new fuel technologies have a strong role in developing the GVRP research further.","Sabet S., Farooq B.",Green Vehicle Routing Problem: State of the Art and Future Directions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139453337&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2022.3208899&partnerID=40&md5=5d8555f4ad524d6322e8d3ad6da4fa00
Sociological Review,"Growing awareness of environmental issues and their relation to consumption patterns has given rise to calls for sustainable consumption across the globe. In this article, we focus on the zero waste lifestyle movement, which targets high-consumption households in the Global North as a site of change for phasing out waste in global supply chains. Our article is concerned with asking how gender and household sustainability are mutually constituted in the zero waste lifestyle movement. We establish an analytical tension between understanding zero waste living as a further intensification of feminised responsibility for people and the planet and as offering potential for transformational change – as feminised concern or feminist care. Through qualitative content analysis of the 10 most influential zero waste blogs globally, we show how the five zero waste rules of conduct – refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, and rot – guide consumers towards everyday and situated engagements with waste. Organised by three cross-cutting themes – communing with nature, organising time, and spending money – we present the normativities these rules call into being for reconfiguring domestic activities such as cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. In the discussion, we draw out the implications of zero waste living’s emerging, contradictory gender normativities, while recalling the political economy in which it is situated, namely a neoliberal, postfeminist landscape. We identify a continued feminisation of domestic responsibilities that is uncontested in zero waste living but also explore the progressive potential of waste-free living to bring collective, naturecultural worlds into being as part of domestic environmental labour.","Wilde M.D., Parry S.",Feminised concern or feminist care?

Composites Part C: Open Access,"Growing consumption trends put a strain on natural resource availability as the needs of near-term production targets are prioritized over that of long-term sustainability. In our current linear economic system, raw materials are transformed into useful products for consumption and subsequently disposed of. To achieve environmental sustainability, a circular economic system should be evaluated with the goal to examine and implement potential recovery pathways for waste products. There has been a growing interest in synthesizing biofuels via pyrolysis to move away from unsustainable and disruptive petroleum supply-chains. This aids in achieving sustainability as the products of pyrolysis can be recovered for a wide range of applications. This pyrolysis byproduct is commonly used for agricultural applications and has been receiving recognition due to emerging research on its implementation for composite materials to provide an alternative to carbon black (petroleum-based). As researchers are recognizing the advantages and uncovering more recovery channels for biocarbon, a comprehensive understanding of the recent developments and challenges is required to critically assess the viability of this product to be used in various industries. Given a lack of reviews drawing attention to the emerging application, this work aims to provide a comprehensive view of the processes involved to transform agricultural products into biocarbon.

Furthermore, it also explores whether sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) mediates the relationship between HumEnt and SCP. Simultaneously, examining whether green corporate social responsibility (GCSR) moderates HumEnt's influence on SSCM.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Growing global demand for natural rubber is driving deforestation due to the expansion of rubber plantations, with consequences for biodiversity, carbon storage, and local communities. There has been little attention given to these issues in Sri Lanka, where rubber production is central to economic growth. Although private initiatives and government regulations aim to reduce deforestation associated with these plantations, it is unclear if these measures effectively protect forests or limit associated risks in the supply chains of companies purchasing Sri Lankan rubber. This paper uses the TRACAST methodological framework and remote sensing to track natural rubber supply chains from Sri Lanka to the U.S and to identify hidden deforestation risks resulting from this trade. We estimate 196 km2 of forest were converted into rubber plantations between 2006 and 2016, including protected forests located in an emerging rubber frontier in southeast Sri Lanka. Our analysis identifies rubber traders and multinational tire manufacturers as key actors that hinder the traceability of rubber back to the plantations. This opacity increases the potential for unsustainably produced rubber to enter global supply chains of transnational corporations such as Loadstar (Michelin) and Nike. Most of these corporations have sustainable procurement policies, but the effectiveness of these policies is compromised by the lack of supply chain transparency. Integrating public and private sector management through inclusive multi-stakeholder initiatives and multi-level land use governance can help overcome these hurdles, prevent future deforestation, and assist Sri Lanka in moving towards more sustainable rubber production.","Cho K., Goldstein B., Gounaridis D., Newell J.P.",Hidden risks of deforestation in global supply chains: A study of natural rubber flows from Sri Lanka to the United States,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127281646&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.131275&partnerID=40&md5=23b420a41deef01708e7a398ef6efe00
International Journal of Sustainable Engineering,"Growing population leads to generating more waste and depletion of natural resources. Moreover, the cost of supplying some resources has increased substantially. Hence, the manufacturer is trying to focus on planning to get back old or partially/wholly unusable products and make the best disposition decisions on them. This research aims to build a multi-industry applied model using the deep learning method in social media analysis to make the best decision for returning products in reverse logistics, along with the sustainability and circular economy concerns. Furthermore, we outline the usage of social network analytics in aligning consumers’ expectations with supply chain policies, strategies, and decisions. An industry benchmark concerning circular economy concepts can be attained by applying the proposed model to different industries. We have proposed a generalisable model using social media analytics, consumer sentiment analysis, reverse logistics, and circular economy theory to attain a circular supply chain regarding sustainability concerns. Applying the proposed model to the electronics industry as a case study, the model was further validated with Twitter data analysis of developing versus developed countries for laptop devices. We collected over 70-million tweets using the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) over fifteen months. The results approved the proposed model by leveraging the Twitter geolocation attribute to extract Twitter data from developing and developed countries. Moreover, the model is general enough to be used on various industries’ supply chains and provides managers and policymakers with deep insight into reverse logistics’ decision-making. It would be interesting to use real-time analytics and improve accuracy in future works. We made original contributions to reverse logistics decision-making in the circular economy context. Previous research, which has focused on supply chain decision-making, has been extended by providing theoretical and practical implications for social media analytics and the circular economy ecosystem. Thus, by scrutinising the consumers’ needs and expectations, we suggested the best decision on returned products to close an open-ended supply chain and achieve a circular economy. Furthermore, we derived industry benchmarks for both developing and developed countries separately.

"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Growing public concern over agricultural nitrogen (N) pollution is now reflected in consumers’ food choices and shareholders’ resolutions, causing rapid changes in global food supply chains. Nitrate (NO3) leaching represents the primary N source for groundwater contamination and freshwater ecosystem degradation. However, simplified science-based indicators are still lacking to facilitate improved N management practices at the farm-level. We conducted a global analysis of published field studies to evaluate N balance (N inputs minus N outputs) as a robust predictor for NO3 losses. Using 82 studies (1110 observations) for rainfed cereal crops in temperate regions, we 1) quantified the response of NO3 losses to changes in N balance for major rainfed cereal crops while accounting for environmental and management variables; and 2) assessed the feasibility of improving water quality through lower N balance under different scenarios using the case study of maize (Zea mays L.) data from the US Corn Belt. Observations were grouped in studies from the US and non-US regions. Results show that NO3 losses increased exponentially as N balance increases for both the US and non-US regions, though they were 60% higher in the US at a given N balance. Scenario analysis revealed that reducing the N rate from the agronomic optimum to the lower point within the economic optimum N rate range decreased NO3 losses by 13% without impacting economic returns. The case study for maize showed that improvements in N use efficiency that increase grain yield at a given fertilizer rate can substantially reduce N balance and mitigate NO3 losses. This study provides an evidence-based foundation for food supply chain companies to mitigate global NO3 pollution, specifically by using the generalized relationships presented here to track progress in NO3 leaching mitigation. To further resolve uncertainties and improve region-specific estimates for NO3 losses, we propose a tiered monitoring and assessment framework similar to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) methodology for N2O emissions, widely implemented in science and used for policy.","Tamagno S., Eagle A.J., McLellan E.L., van Kessel C., Linquist B.A., Ladha J.K., Pittelkow C.M.",Quantifying N leaching losses as a function of N balance: A path to sustainable food supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118130954&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2021.107714&partnerID=40&md5=a200083d3200433cb7a87b5daf5d640b
"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Growing public interest in environmental, social, and governance issues requires all organizations to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Because the metals industry has been less likely to report engagement with the SDGs than other sectors, exploring its relationship with the SDGs is essential in accelerating its engagement with these goals. This study examines the relationship between the metals industry and the SDGs by analyzing reports of 61 metal companies. The analysis adopts the number of activities associated with SDGs as a proxy indicator in measuring the intensity of association between the company and 17 SDGs. The results show that the metals industry places most focus on SDGs 8, 3, and 12, but its activities are less associated with SDGs 14, 2, and 1 on the whole. Furthermore, this relationship with the SDGs shows different trends among metal producers: the steel industry places great weight on SDG 12 and less on SDGs 1 and 2, whereas the copper industry recognizes the relevance to SDGs 1 and 2. This is attributed to the different positions of the production companies in the supply chain because current SDG reporting seems to be strongly affected by the circumstances and stakeholders they face directly.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Health service providers in developed nations are responsible for 5% of their national carbon emissions, much of which originate from transport and supply chains. Connected autonomous freight vehicles (CAV-Fs) offer the potential to reduce this impact and enable lower cost operations, with trials being explored across the world. Transportation and carriage regulations, particularly in relation to the movement of dangerous goods (DG) such as medicines and diagnostic specimens, have not been developed for and applied to this new transport mode, particularly where loads are unaccompanied. Through an audit of current legislation and practice, this paper evaluates current DGs regulations applied to the transportation of medical products and medicines by autonomous road vehicles. Where existing regulations are not appropriate for CAV-Fs, recommendations and adaptations have been proposed to support safe and practical application.

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Health services are rapidly growing around the world and the supply chain risk management (SCRM) is imperative to achieve business sustainability in the long-term perspective. The present research aims to identify the risks in a home care health service provider, evaluating the potential failures causes and establishing actions to reduce the likelihood of patients’ harm associated with medication process flaws. We conducted a single case study, evaluating and identifying possible risks in a health services company located in Brazil. Although the results of the present research have no statistical basis to support quantitative inferences, an approach based on qualitative criteria can be replicated. We followed a logical sequence of steps to manage the medicines and hospital products’ supply risks, using standards and risk management (RM) tools widely applied by the professional and academic community. As main results, it was observed that “wrong material kit supply” as the most relevant issue for SCRM. As practical implications, this research has the potential to prevent people who depend on home care services, from receiving incorrect medicines (or failing to receive them). In extreme cases, such as the administration of medications that were incorrectly sent to patients, deaths can be avoided, since those involved in the outbound logistic processes will have the ability to work proactively in mitigating actions that avoid this type of risk.","de Oliveira U.R., Muniz M.D.A., Anaia L.A., Rocha H.M.",Medication supply chain risk management for a brazilian home care provider: a business sustainability study,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124424911&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2021.100018&partnerID=40&md5=332e3c289823709dda75ca2a923718a2
Bioenergy Research,"High quantity of potato wastage from the process and cold storage facilities in India poses serious disposal issues and loss of carbonaceous starches. Waste potato biomass has the potential estimated to be 6.3–7.2 MMT of fermentable sugar equivalent per annum. This study evaluates ethanol and yeast lipid production feasibility using the non-marketable waste potato. For obtaining optimum sugar, the dilute acid hydrolysis was first optimized by one variable at a time (OVAT) approach, and an artificial neural network was formulated to model the hydrolysis process. The optimized variables considered were reaction time, temperature, and acid concentration. The optimum glucose concentration of 55.82 g/L was utilized as a carbon source for ethanol and yeast lipid production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa IIPL32. Ethanol and lipid concentrations of 33.74 and 2.6 g/L were obtained, respectively. The carbon balance of the two processes showed that the flow of net carbon concerning the feedstock was more towards the waste streams. The finding, therefore, proposes that with proper supply chain management, this fermentable carbon can be destined as a co-feed in any existing distillery, or even a separate decentralized system can be envisaged. This study thus investigates the stepwise carbon mapping from the feedstock to the product leading to a cradle to gate carbon flow assessment to understand the net carbon sustainability.","Banerjee A., Sailwal M., Hafeez M., Jana A., Porwal J., Bhaskar T., Ghosh D.",Dilute Acid Hydrolysis and Bioconversion of Waste Potato to Ethanol and Yeast Lipid for Evaluating Carbon Flow in Waste Biorefinery,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132606746&doi=10.1007%2fs12155-022-10433-1&partnerID=40&md5=5e3496ec74821b813ee839bf2b6dcc5c
International Forestry Review,"HIGHLIGHTS During the post-Independence era several state-led efforts aimed to regulate and control the international shea trade through stabilization funds and parastatal marketing boards. These were abandoned after 1984, when cocoa prices collapsed and shea markets were liberalized. After 2003, leading Trans-National Corporations that manufacture Cocoa Butter Equivalents are increasingly involved in sourcing shea kernels to meet the growing demand for Speciality Fats in the confectionary, food and cosmetic industries, Women shea producers have also harnessed new market opportunities to produce ‘hand-crafted' shea butter for the cosmetics industry and niche edible markets following regulatory changes. Women shea producers have clearly demonstrated their capacity to respond to new global markets and to meet customer demands for sustainability whilst maintaining shea kernel and butter supplies to local periodic, national, and regional markets. A critical new challenge is how to strengthen current efforts to restore shea agroforestry parklands as a key source of livelihoods and ecosystem services by harnessing both ancient and modern farming techniques. SUMMARY After Burkina Faso's independence, shea butter continues to be the key staple edible oil used by Burkinabe households although alternatives are now being placed in local markets. Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn.) is primarily managed as a food tree crop for African consumers but has been promoted as a wild and abundant crop which gives African women cash and empowerment. New international demand for edible Cocoa Butter Equivalents (CBEs) from the 1960s onwards led to the introduction of several state-led efforts to regulate and control the shea trade through stabilization funds and parastatal marketing boards. These were abandoned after 1984, when cocoa prices collapsed and shea markets were liberalized. Increasingly since 2003, several leading Trans-National Corporations that manufacture CBEs are involved in sourcing shea kernels to meet the growing demands of the multi-billion-dollar confectionary and cosmetics industries. Burkina Faso and Ghana are two of the main exporting countries producing 60-75% of all international shea offtake. West, Central and East African women shea collectors and their associations have also managed, more recently, to meet the growing demand for ‘hand-crafted' shea butter for the global personal care sector and new niches in the edible oil industry. Attempts to explain the radical transformation of shea supply chains in West Africa have focused on relatively recent events and actions detached from the broader historical context in which they are embedded. This paper adopts a broad periodization, stemming from the formulation of CBEs incorporating shea and palm stearin in the 1960s, and using a Global Production Network approach to understand the role and position of women shea producers and their associations at the intersection of global, regional, and local periodic markets. It challenges the assumption that global markets are necessarily a more viable alternative to reliance on local, domestic, or regional markets. The growth of global trade in shea kernels and shea butter has been accompanied by significant land cover and land use changes which has led to the progressive loss of trees, biodiversity, and other ecosystem services such as pollination and carbon sequestration. This presents new socio-economic challenges, including threats to local food and nutrition security, tenure rights and the livelihoods of local communities. .","Wardell D.A., Tapsoba A., Lovett P.N., Zida M., Rousseau K., Gautier D., Elias M., Bama T.","Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa C.F.

Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,"Historical experience shows that the people's happiness index is highly correlated with the development of agriculture. The prosperity of agriculture and industrial production has also brought most people into a well-off life. Since the innovation of agricultural production equipment and concepts, the efficiency of agricultural production in my country has also been greatly improved compared to before the reform and opening up. In the era when robots will gradually become mainstream work machinery tools, the production efficiency and supply of agricultural products will become the focus of attention of the people of all countries. In such a general environment, the competition between agricultural products markets is no longer solely based on the competitiveness of agricultural products but also depends on the advantages of the agricultural supply chain to win. This article analyzes the construction of the sustainable operation mechanism of the agricultural supply chain in the context of wireless communication and the Internet of Things. First, the method of literature research is used to explain the characteristics of the agricultural supply chain and the problems existing in the development of the current agricultural supply chain model in the context of wireless communication and the Internet of Things. Next, study the current situation of the sustainability mechanism of the agricultural supply chain, and finally optimize the construction of the sustainability mechanism of the agricultural supply chain products based on the research results. According to the survey results, the main problem with the current mechanism of the agricultural product supply chain at this stage is that the logistics information technology is difficult to update in time, accounting for about 44%, followed by the lack of effective monitoring methods, accounting for about 34%.","Wang Q., Cai Y.",Analysis on the Construction of Sustainable Operation Mechanism of Agricultural Product Supply Chain under the Background of Wireless Communication and Internet of Things,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127904508&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f4539146&partnerID=40&md5=9ffdf926d856a1976d08f41ad7d6f377

Journal of Supply Chain Management,"Horizontal logistics collaboration can increase environmental sustainability and reduce shipping costs. Given these benefits—and the fact that few shippers actually opt to collaborate—public sector agencies and industry associations have attempted to sponsor and support the facilitation of horizontal logistics collaboration projects over the past 20 years. The literature, however, has yet to reveal the fact that these efforts have largely failed. Here, we introduce systematic horizontal logistics collaboration and apply Ostrom's theory of the commons and agency theory to extract antecedents on why these projects failed. We present a multiple-case study on unsuccessful horizontal logistics collaboration projects in Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. We address a gap in supply chain literature with regard to systematic collaboration; we also demonstrate the utility of commons theory in the supply chain domain and contribute to the literature on supply chain collaboration with facilitators.

RAIRO - Operations Research,"Human-made, natural, and unexpected disasters always cause human and financial losses to communities. Disaster management is a framework with proven performance to reduce the damage caused by disaster and supply chain disruptions. Transferring the injured people from affected areas to hospitals at the minimum possible time is a crucial goal in times of disaster. This paper develops a two-stage stochastic programming model to transport the injured people from affected areas to hospitals in the incidence of multiple disruptions at transportation links and facilities under uncertainties. Herein, economic, social, and environmental aspects of sustainability are considered, while simultaneous disruptions are managed to minimize the adverse impacts of the disasters. We aim to determine optimal locations to establish transfer points and flows between the relief network nodes with sustainability considerations. Ultimately, a case study in District 12 of Tehran, Iran is conducted to ensure the proposed model' s validity and performance. Various sensitivity analyses are also implemented to ensure the model' s effectiveness. The results indicate that disruptions in facilities and transportation links lead to increased relief time, hence has the most significant negative impact on relief operations.","Desi-Nezhad Z., Sabouhi F., Dehghani Sadrabadi M.H.",An optimization approach for disaster relief network design under uncertainty and disruption with sustainability considerations,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128828395&doi=10.1051%2fro%2f2022021&partnerID=40&md5=6d538615d6c8d52cbf6978f4018978d1
Phytochemistry Reviews,"Humulus lupulus L. (hop) is a dioecious climbing plant of which the females bear particular inflorescences, called hops, ‘cones’ or ‘strobiles’, made of a series of membranaceous bracts and bracteoles. At the base of these ‘cones’ occur glandular trichomes where a complex metabolome is synthesized mainly consisting of terpenoids (constituents of essential oil) and original prenylated phenolic compounds. These latter are represented by acylphloroglucinols including α-acids (humulone and its derivatives) and β-acids (lupulone and its derivatives), as well as chalcones (xanthohumol and desmethylxanthohumol). Some of these compounds, terpenoids and sulfur-containing compounds from essential oils and α-acids, are particularly sought after by brewers because they impact bitterness, aroma, flavour and storage properties of beer. Yield of α-acids and bittering performance drove selection of cultivars until demand for alternative flavour options from craft brewers emerged. More aromatic cultivars with intense fruit-like character have been in high demand in recent years due to the trend for hoppy beers and dry hopping. Moreover, there is a tendency toward local consumption associated with craft beer. In addition, consumers and producers are understanding the concepts of sustainability, partially driven by perception of the effects of anthropogenic climate change. Finally, traditional supply chains are facing legitimate challenges from small scale local producers.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science,"Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier and feedstock alike for decarbonizing the energy, transport, and chemical sector and mitigating the effects of global warming. Identifying and realizing environmentally friendly hydrogen production pathways is, however, significantly impeded by the need for step-wise transformation of national energy systems. This paper reviews the current level of hydrogen production technology development. Nine process configurations based on four different process technologies were considered comprising steam methane reforming, steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage, methane pyrolysis and polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis. Hydrogen from these technologies is often associated with the respective colors grey, blue, turquoise, and green. The critical comparison of the technologies is objectified and quantified based on the methodology of life cycle assessment. For this purpose, the environmental impacts of the hydrogen production technologies are gathered and the most promising solutions with respect to the progressing energy transition identified thereby differentiating the approaches for their short, medium-, and long-term benefit. By considering sixteen impact categories, both, environmental co-benefits and burden shifting resulting from the transition to more climate-friendly hydrogen production technologies were taken into account. The environmental impact of the hydrogen production technologies was found to be determined to large extend by the underlying electricity and natural gas supply chains. Anticipating technology shifts and taking regional differences and future advances in national supply chains into account, technology recommendations deviate substantially for the countries considered.","Hermesmann M., Müller T.E.","Green, Turquoise, Blue, or Grey?

International Journal of Sustainable Transportation,"Hydrogen-based transportation has gained popularity and has presented significant growth over the past few years, providing an excellent platform for capitalizing on natural resources while attaining global carbon policies and sustainability targets. However, lack of infrastructure, cost of fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen fuel, and absence of established hydrogen supply chains have been identified as critical challenges of hydrogen-based mobility. Despite current studies predominantly focusing on hydrogen-fueled passenger vehicles and related infrastructure, it was identified that the impacts of hydrogen fuel supply chain for freight transportation from a life cycle thinking perspective have been largely overlooked. This article aims at critically reviewing the existing body-of-knowledge on the current status of hydrogen fueling supply chain and exploring the potential of integrating hydrogen fuel for road freight transportation. Accordingly, the current status of alternative fuel use for freight transportation is discussed over technical, economic, and environmental dimensions outlining its benefits and challenges. Moreover, the pertinence of innovative and established methods of hydrogen production, distribution, and storage for freight transportation are evaluated based on a comprehensive literature review. This study reveals that the transformation of freight transportation into low-emission alternative fuels would require a comprehensive multicriteria assessment that includes technical, economic, environmental, and social feasibilities over the life cycle of the freight vehicle and the fuel supply chain.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Improving the cold chain system for perishable foods would both increase food safety by maintaining quality and reduce business operation costs by minimizing food loss from inappropriate management. This has led to various attempts to apply blockchain technology (BCT) to the food cold chain, such as IBM's FoodTrust and Alibaba's Food Trust Frameworks. This system is expected to guarantee food traceability and sustainability. In this research, we focused on the importance of maritime and aviation transportation in the entire supply chain, and we established the BCT-based beef cold chain system, which includes the reefer chain. Specifically, we raised the monitoring and physical infrastructure issues at the port (or airport) and maritime (aviation) transportation node and took these into consideration. Additionally, we conducted scenario analysis to investigate the effects of the suggested system. The amount of food losses and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are calculated by different scenarios in accordance with the recall recovery time and node where a recall occurrence is recognized. For both import and export models, when the proposed BCT-based beef cold chain platform is applied, the number of discarded reefer containers and the associated GHG emissions go down by 42.1% and 21.8%, respectively. Interestingly, when we assumed the recall recognition stage was right after the defects occur, the largest effects of improving performance of the proposed platform were 48.3% in import (IM) node of the port level.

At first, this policy was only applied to the company to be a high carbon stock (HCS) forest concept, but its scope was restricted. In December 2013, a large agribusiness related to oil palm products, Wilmar International Ltd., introduced their NDPE policy, thus creating standards for its entire supply chain. Wilmar agreed to avoid purchasing from suppliers who burned trees, drained peatland, or abused local people (Scott, 2014).

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"In 2018, the fashion sector was responsible for approximately 2.1 billion metric tons of GHG emissions, half of which were created by fast fashion. Fast fashion brands produce high volumes of synthetic, petroleum-based garments in developing countries, creating high levels of emissions and textile waste. In recent years, fast fashion leaders have adopted sustainability initiatives, including sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). However, even with current strategies in place, fast fashion is on a trajectory that will contribute to irreparable damage to the environment by 2030. The following study analyzes how fast fashion brands currently implement SSCM, identifies weaknesses in current initiatives, and outlines key actions brands can take to significantly reduce the environmental impact of their supply chains in the long term. To analyze SSCM in the fast fashion industry, this study compares the sustainability reports of H&M and Everlane, industry leaders with strong sustainability messaging. This comparison reveals that fast fashion has failed to sufficiently engage upstream and downstream stakeholders in their SSCM strategies. Moving forward, fast fashion companies should incentivize collaboration towards more comprehensive SSCM policies throughout the supply chain.

In practice, production planning and inventory control decisions are not separated, and supply chain members can significantly reduce costs through the coordination of production and inventory decisions. Research in this field has received much attention in recent years. This study aims to review coordination, cooperation, and collaboration (CCC) mechanisms in production-inventory studies. By using an established research methodology, a total of 118 articles were reviewed and the implemented CCC mechanisms were classified into three main categories: contractual practices, joint decision-making practices, and information-sharing practices. By examining the selected articles according to the implemented methodologies and their impact on the sustainably of supply chains, research gaps and future directions for academics and practitioners were identified. This study shows that more research is needed to discover the impact of combining different CCC mechanisms on supply chain efficiency in terms of economic, environmental, and social concerns.","Ghasemi E., Lehoux N., Rönnqvist M.","Coordination, cooperation, and collaboration in production-inventory systems: a systematic literature review",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133637337&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2022.2093681&partnerID=40&md5=4f95a93ec1a3d6b33d23f99e19b9b7ee
"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","In a context of increasing concern regarding food loss and waste (FLW) generation, different attempts have been made to standardize quantification methodologies. On the one hand, an important number of small-scale studies have been published that constitute direct measurement methodologies. On the other hand, the FAO Food Balance Sheets, which aggregate some of the prior studies, provides an indirect metric that has been applied using FLW coefficients in numerous food-related studies. However, to date, no standard methodology has been agreed upon to quantify FLW. This study performs an assessment of 237 studies in the field, aiming to identify existing FLW quantification methodologies, and if there is a need of developing alternative paths. Firstly, a descriptive review was performed. Secondly, an assessment of critical point of views was presented. For this, different critical voices in the scientific literature were retrieved, some of which highlight the high level of uncertainty and a certain degree of opacity in some of the most widespread FLW quantification and assessment reports. In this line, essential elements of quantification are being omitted. Moreover, the focus is being excessively placed on the role of the consumer, compared to the role played by agribusiness and large distribution chains.","Hoehn D., Vázquez-Rowe I., Kahhat R., Margallo M., Laso J., Fernández-Ríos A., Ruiz-Salmón I., Aldaco R.",A critical review on food loss and waste quantification approaches: Is there a need to develop alternatives beyond the currently widespread pathways?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138810463&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2022.106671&partnerID=40&md5=ce5be660cea80549a5da49ea3db9bcb0
Annals of Operations Research,"In a highly competitive environment, characterized by shorter product life cycles, mass customization and fluctuating markets, the supply chain network design is considered as one of the most important steps for reducing their costs, increasing their performance, competitiveness and profits. In addition, due to the growing social, governmental and industrial concerns about environmental protection and greenhouse gas reduction, policy makers are now forced to incorporate the environmental issue and sustainability constraints into their logistics network design process. The purpose of the present paper is to address the issue of sustainable supply-chain-network design by integrating simultaneously the strategic decisions related to the location of facilities with limited capacity and transport network design with capacity constraints on the links to be built, and constraints related to environmental protection. A multi-objective model is proposed to minimize the cost and environmental impact associated with transport activities by considering different environmental impacts of the links to be built. An adaptation of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, using mixed coding is developed to effectively solve the proposed model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a number of numerical experiments on instances of different sizes have been performed. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is presented to analyse the behaviour of the proposed model in response to changes in the key parameters of the problem.","Brahami M.A., Dahane M., Souier M., Sahnoun M.",Sustainable capacitated facility location/network design problem: a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm based multiobjective approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085517817&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-020-03659-9&partnerID=40&md5=74b6cfda15f6f58be233552d6f646e92
Green Energy and Technology,"In a nation, reconstruction is needed to provide resiliency and maintain economic growth. To remedy the damage done on roads and highways after an event, the reconstruction of earth-retaining walls (ERWs) before road/highway rehabilitation is of great importance. This would provide land transportation routes from airports or emergency personnel services to save lives and transport supplies/materials to disaster-stricken areas. It is one of the most common structures in civil engineering designed to retain earth pressure on roads and highways. It is constructed using concrete, a widely used construction material with high material consumption and carbon footprint. Aside from these, construction and demolition wastes (CDW) arise from the damaged ERWs and any concrete materials contributing to adverse impacts on the environment. These alarming facts are some of the many reasons for evaluating construction materials, such as using life cycle assessment (LCA) on CDWs. This paper investigates the use of ERWs using concrete from cradle-to-gate with natural aggregates (NAs) and recycled aggregates (RAs) from CDW. It considers three ERW types, such as gravity wall, cantilever wall, and mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) wall. It was found that the construction of MSE walls, among other types of earth retaining structures, is found to be 50–70% of less impact than other types of ERWs in this study. The utilization of RA in the production of concrete is up to 15% less impactful than NA, even with the additional 10% increase in cement content to compensate for the strength loss from the use of RA to NA. In ideal condition, the transport distances of NA and RA should be around 15–20 km from extraction of raw materials and processing, to concrete pouring. A limit of 100 km transport distance for RA must also be considered so that the environmental benefits from the use of RA would not be outweighed. Further studies on the economic aspect and the sustainability of its supply chain during the reconstruction are recommended.","Ongpeng J.M.C., Ginga C.P.",Life Cycle Assessment and Carbon Footprint Analysis of Recycled Aggregates in the Construction of Earth-Retaining Walls During Reconstruction,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111974544&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-76441-8_2&partnerID=40&md5=d6fe8764394f5c439b865d9507266338
Annals of Operations Research,"In addition, weights for criterion and links between dimensions and criteria were obtained using the Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process. Both methods can be combined since they serve various goals; earlier studies proposed using three-way type-1 fuzzy sets to achieve criteria weights and linkages across dimensions and criteria. The topics of HRM and Operation Management , respectively, include human resource management (HRM) and supply chain management (SCM). Although academics in each sector continue to advance SCM and HRM's role in developing more sustainable companies, integrating these two modern topics has been significantly delayed based on a more significant integration gap between HRM and SCM and fuzzy. The findings suggest that the educational criterion is more important than the other criteria since it is a cause and affects HRM directly. The research findings show that the suggested F-HRM-SCM technique is feasible, suggesting the educational criterion as the most persuasive factor in human resources management. Therefore, the study aims to provide the HRM-SCM connection with a synergistic and inclusive framework and suggest the research agenda for this integration. After achieving these aims, this paper highlights the consequences of fuzzy HRM-SCM integration in organizational sustainability and genuinely sustainable supply chains for academics, managers, and practitioners. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed F-HRM-SCM model enhances the supply chain performance ratio of 98.9%, an efficiency ratio of 97.8%, employee satisfaction ratio of 96.7%, decision-making level by 98.2%, prediction ratio of 95.5%, and F1-score ratio of 97.4% compared to other existing approaches.","Alshurideh M.T., Al Kurdi B., Alzoubi H.M., Ghazal T.M., Said R.A., AlHamad A.Q., Hamadneh S., Sahawneh N., Al-kassem A.H.",Fuzzy assisted human resource management for supply chain management issues,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123502775&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-021-04472-8&partnerID=40&md5=2d0abf757c40cc16e022de22d893aaa9
RAIRO - Operations Research,"In alignment with the ever-growing interest in adopting sustainable practices, this paper devises a cold supply chain (CSC) planning model that integrates the three pillars of sustainability into the decision-making process while accounting for the shift towards clean energy sources. Interrelated decisions pertaining to production-distribution strategy, backorder and inventory levels, choice of truck type, and selection of third-party logistics (3PLs) providers are jointly optimized. For global CSCs in specific, such decisions are particularly sensitive to the energy sources of the refrigerated facilities and the accompanying levels of CO2 emissions generated. As such, a multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed and then solved via the weighted-sum method. In essence, the model seeks to operationalize sustainability goals by considering the rapidly evolving transition in energy sources across different regions when deciding on which 3PLs to engage in a contractual agreement with while adjusting the production and distribution strategy accordingly. The practical relevance of the model is illustrated using a case study drawn from the North American frozen food industry. The conducted trade-off analysis indicates the possibility of obtaining a drastic improvement of 86% in jobs stability levels (social measure) with a maximum cost increase of around 9% as compared to the economic measure. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that it is possible to reduce 71% of CO2 emissions while attaining 63% reduction in worker variations at the expense of only 4.47% cost increase once compared to solely optimizing the economic objective.","Chaabane A., As-Ad R., Geramianfar R., Bahroun Z.",Utilizing energy transition to drive sustainability in cold supply chains: A case study in the frozen food industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131243487&doi=10.1051%2fro%2f2022043&partnerID=40&md5=179b5197c54d28250ca4204ae8fc712c
Sustainability (Switzerland),"In an era where environmental and social pressures on companies are increasing, sustainable supply chain management is essential for the efficient operation and survivability of the organizations (members of the chain). Digital transformation and the adoption of new technologies could support the development of sustainable strategies, as they support supply chain processes, decrease operational costs, enable control and monitoring of operations and support green practices. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between sustainable supply chain management and digital transformation through the adoption of specific technologies (Blockchain technology, big data analytics, internet of things). It aims at theory building and the development of a conceptual framework, enabling the explanation of under which circumstances the above combination could lead to the development of sustainable performances. It also aims to examine how companies can increase their competitive advantage and/or increase their business performance, contributing both to academics and practitioners. After conducting a literature review analysis, a significant gap was detected. There are a few studies providing theoretical approaches to examining all three pillars of sustainability, while at the same time analyzing the impact of big data analytics, internet of things and blockchain technology on the development of sustainable supply chains. Aiming to address this gap, this paper primarily conducts a literature review, identifies definitions and theories used to explain the different pillars of flexibility, and examines the effect of different technologies. It then develops a theoretical conceptual framework, which could enable both academics and practitioners to examine the impact of the adoption of different technologies on sustainable supply chain management. The findings of this research reveal that digital transformation plays an important role to companies, as the combination of different technologies may lead to the development of significant capabilities, increasing sustainable performances and enabling the development of sustainable strategies, which can improve companies’ position in the market.","Stroumpoulis A., Kopanaki E.",Theoretical Perspectives on Sustainable Supply Chain Management and Digital Transformation: A Literature Review and a Conceptual Framework,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129140273&doi=10.3390%2fsu14084862&partnerID=40&md5=f62583fa1cfeaff3cc129fc2021182f6
Journal of Cleaner Production,"In an industry 4.0 era, manufacturers must make the right decisions concerning reutilizing and recycling returned goods to lower waste by connecting and integrating societal behaviour with industrial practices. Since customers would not buy unsatisfactory goods, managers have to decide whether to reuse or recycle them. Proposing a framework in which consumers involve in supply chain managerial decisions leads to customer-centric reverse logistics by introducing a Decentralized consensus decision-making concept. Moreover, an industry benchmark would aid managers and policymakers. Based on Logistics 4.0, this study developed a framework and used social media data to improve reverse logistics decision-making using artificial intelligence - a deep learning hybrid method that combines convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks. Furthermore, this study shows how to use sentiment analysis algorithms to analyze positive and negative feedback from customers and develop high-efficiency decentralized disposition decision-making techniques for reverse logistic managers. Without the need for human intervention, corporations may use the framework to smart scrutinize their customers' feedback and sentiments to make strategic reverse logistics decisions for reducing returned goods, waste, inventory levels, and costs while increasing productivity, benefits, supply chain sustainability, and customer loyalty, resulting in a more effective movement towards green logistics, a competitive advantage, and increased profits for the corporation.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"In compliance with environmental and emerging international imperatives, promoting sustainable consumption and production is far due and pivotal for greening supply chains. Rampant demand for environmentally-friendly products and regulatory changes have pressured manufacturing companies to reassess their products and processes. Yet, the cost of greening and its allocation remain challenging tasks. This study investigates government subsidy strategies to encourage firms to transition to green production strategies and improve environmental quality when heterogeneous consumers are sensitive to sustainability. We consider a leader-follower Stackelberg game between two profit-maximizing firms with different green technologies (the followers) and a government (the leader). Those two competing firms sell two differentiated products to a price- and pollution-sensitive market. We first discuss the target level of greenness that can improve the environmental quality and then design the appropriate subsidy rate. We show that the government subsidy can decrease the selling price, increase the market share and the profit from greener products, and positively affect EQ. Contrary to some findings in the literature, we find that a higher subsidy rate may not always simultaneously benefit the environment, social welfare, and social surplus.

Ecological Economics,"In credit systems, purportedly sustainable activities are undertaken in one place to compensate for unsustainable activities elsewhere. These mechanisms originated in pollution abatement systems but now are found in many sustainability programs, including supply chain certification. Credit programs are used in various sustainability certification programs to lower transaction costs, boost uptake, and direct more resources to small producers, but they are also controversial. The relational values framework argues that one way to motivate people to support sustainability efforts is to emphasize what behaviors are appropriate to specific relationships. We ask whether changing the way we think and talk about credits may be a way to direct more resources to producers or places willing to engage in sustainability certification. Using an embedded survey experiment, we test this reframing with a sample of representatives of member organizations of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We find that the relational values reframing of the RSPO's crediting mechanism is perceived to be less confusing and potentially damaging to the standard's reputation than the existing framing. This evidence suggests that relational values frames might be helpful tools as part of efforts to improve sustainability in global value chains.","Gallemore C., Jespersen K., Olmsted P.",Harnessing relational values for global value chain sustainability: Reframing the roundtable on sustainable palm oil's offset mechanism to support smallholders,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120629976&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecolecon.2021.107303&partnerID=40&md5=4a8b3c77ca8bbd5d1651933af44aa9de
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"In engineering, the biofuel supply chain (BSC) is a significant supply chain optimization challenge. Here, the multi-objective optimization problem for biofuel distribution is based on the life cycle energy consumption (LCEC) and the emission of CO2 involve in supply network of a biofuel. It includes numerous feedstocks, means of transportation, and locations for biofuel plant construction, as well as multiple technologies, the number of feedstocks in the agricultural system, transportation capabilities, crop yields, and market needs. To provide a modelling framework for optimization issues with multi-fold uncertainty, different reduction approaches to turn a Type-2 Fuzzy variable into a Type-1 Fuzzy variable through the expected value method are described. The deterministic BSC model is then solved utilizing Goal Programming and Weighted Sum Method using Generalized Reduced Gradient Technique. The goal BSC models are (i) Minimization of life cycle energy consumption (ii) total emission of CO2 in uncertain environment. The numerical experiments demonstrated with different optimistic labels by which managers can control their objects by choosing optimistic values.

Annals of Operations Research,"In era of reglobalization, sustainably resilient supply chains (SCs) are imperative in corporations to improve performance and meet stockholders’ expectations. However, sustainably resilient SCs could not be effective if are not assessed by using advanced frameworks, systems, and models. As such, developing a novel network data envelopment model (DEA) to appraise sustainably resilient SCs is our purpose in this article. To do so, we present a new double-frontier methodology to provide optimistic and pessimistic efficiency measures in network structures. Moreover, ideas of outputs weak disposability, chance-constrained programming, and discrete dominance are incorporated in a unified framework of modelling efficient and inefficient production technologies. The new network DEA model also can address dissimilar types of data, including undesirable and integer-valued and ratio outputs, stochastic intermediate products, and integer-valued inputs in a unified framework. Furthermore, an aggregated Farrell type efficiency measure is developed which allows to provide the complete ranking of units so that each decision-making unit (DMU) has its own rank in both overall and divisional point of view.

IEEE Access,"In essence, the extent of collaboration among supply chain (SC) members, via practical mechanisms such as Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), shall look beyond economic gains to strive for curbing the environmental impact of their logistics activities. This aligns well with the recently imposed sustainability related targets set by many legislative authorities. In this paper, we address a realistic SC problem wherein a single vendor serves multiple retailers under a VMI partnership. In order to deter the vendor from shipping larger batches downstream, the contractual agreement stipulates an upper limit on the inventory level held at each retailer's location where the vendor is penalized upon exceeding this level. In this context, economic and environmental as well as combined models are developed, with the latter employing carbon cap and carbon tax policies. Upon exploiting the structure of the developed models, computationally-efficient exact solution algorithms are devised. The conducted numerical analysis suggest that minor operational adjustments could lead to substantial carbon footprint reduction at the expense of a slight increase in the operational cost. Based on a novel use of the Lagrange multiplier, this work provides decision makers with a useful tool that aids with the selection of the most-suited carbon policy to embrace.","Hariga M., As'Ad R., Ben-Daya M.",Vendor Managed Inventory Coordination Under Contractual Storage Agreement and Carbon Regulation Policies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132734419&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2022.3183988&partnerID=40&md5=96669054d767d5a5ccce7c45d1479926

More specifically, the manufacturing sectors have played a crucial part in the global improvement of living standards. They are also associated with unsustainable production and consumption patterns in a linear system; thus, the circular economy has emerged as an alternative to the linear system. The companies should engage in more sustainable activities to transit to a circular economy and reap its advantages; thus, the present study aims to extend a novel picture fuzzy SWARA-COPRAS framework to assess the manufacturing sectors concerning circular supply chain management indicators. Therefore, sixteen indicators were identified through literature review, and then their weight was determined using picture fuzzy SWARA. Subsequently, the picture fuzzy COPRAS was applied to rank three manufacturing sectors in a home appliance company concerning the weighted indicators.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"In order to deal with sustainability requirements in agri-food supply chains, collaboration among partners is fundamental to collectively achieve competitive advantages. A growing body of literature shows that internationally oriented firms suffer more pressure from stakeholders to develop sustainable initiatives. On the other hand, they may achieve higher levels of sustainable performance due to the access to resources and capabilities from different partners. However, the influence collaboration has on the sustainable performance of internationally oriented firms remains unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the effects environmental collaboration has on sustainable performance, especially in internationally oriented companies. In addition, this study also assessed whether company size influences these relationships. A quantitative study was conducted with 388 medium and large Brazilian companies in the agricultural sector. Data were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares method. We found out that environmental collaboration has a direct effect on sustainable performance. Our study also extends the literature by showing that internationalization orientation strengthens the effects of collaboration on sustainable performance. We found out that all three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, social, and economic) have been positively affected by an increase in environmental collaboration, with a lower effect observed on the economic dimension. Our study also showed that economic outcomes significantly differ between larger and medium companies.

Annals of Operations Research,"In rapidly changing business conditions, it has become extremely important to ensure the sustainability of supply chains and further improve the resiliency to those events, such as COVID-19, that can cause unexpected disruptions in the value supply chain. Although globalized supply chains have already been criticized for lack of control over sustainability and resilience of supply chain operations, these issues have become more prevalent in the uncertain environment driven by COVID-19. The use of emerging technologies such as blockchain, Industry 4.0 analytics model and artificial intelligence driven methods are aimed at increasing the sustainability and resilience of supply chains, especially in an uncertain environment. In this context, this research aims to identify the problematic areas encountered in building a resilient and sustainable supply chain in the pre-COVID-19 era and during COVID-19, and to offer solutions to those problematic areas tackled by an appropriate emerging technology. This research has been contextualized in the automotive industry; this industry has a complex supply chain structure and is one of the sectors most affected by COVID-19. Based on the findings, the most important problematic areas encountered in SSCM pre-COVID-19 are determined as supply chain traceability, demand planning and production management as well as purchasing process planning based on cause and effect groups. The most important issues to be addressed during COVID-19 are top management support, purchasing process planning and supply chain traceability, respectively.","Kazancoglu I., Ozbiltekin-Pala M., Mangla S.K., Kumar A., Kazancoglu Y.",Using emerging technologies to improve the sustainability and resilience of supply chains in a fuzzy environment in the context of COVID-19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132714838&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-022-04775-4&partnerID=40&md5=1f08388155c4190316037f1d0dd12216
Expert Systems with Applications,"In recent decades, due to the growing sustainable development concerns, the supply chains members, such as manufacturers and retailers, are interested in investing in environmental sustainability and social sustainability issues to gain more market share in today's competitive business environment. This paper contributes to the literature by proposing double-level sustainability effort in a sustainable supply chain consists of one manufacturer and one retailer under the cap-and-trade regulation. The manufacturer invests in the technology to reduce carbon emissions and improve the quality of products. On the other hand, the retailer invests in green effort while decides on its periodic review order-up-to-level replenishment policy. Under such a case, both the manufacturer's and the retailer's decisions not only affect their individual profitability but also impact on the whole supply chain performance and sustainability level. Using game-theoretic mathematical modeling, the double-level sustainability effort is first analyzed under the decentralized and centralized structures. Then, a compensation-based wholesale price contract is introduced to coordinate the sustainable supply chain under the cap-and-trade regulation. The surplus profit obtained under the coordination plan is shared between the manufacturer and retailer depending on their bargaining power. The data generated based on the assumptions of a pharmaceutical case study is applied to indicate the applicability of developed models. The results illustrate that the developed coordinated system simultaneously enhances the whole sustainable supply chain performance from the social, environmental, and economic points of view.","Ebrahimi S., Hosseini-Motlagh S.-M., Nematollahi M., Cárdenas-Barrón L.E.",Coordinating double-level sustainability effort in a sustainable supply chain under cap-and-trade regulation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133263309&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.117872&partnerID=40&md5=e2659c5dca87103b957e9c775484b658
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"In recent decades, many firms have broadened their single-channel supply chains (SCs) into dual-channel supply chains (DSCs), endeavoring to gain more market shares. However, due to the resulting competitive situation, the successful performance of DSCs is closely related to the marketing activities conducted by the competitive channels. This study explores the optimality of competitive green service and pricing decisions of the retailing channels of a consumer electronics DSC; therefore, it contributes to the literature on dual-channel systems coordination which often focuses on optimizing the price-only strategies. Since the pricing decisions of the involved parties is a key issue affecting the level of services, this study proposes a combined two-part tariff contract to simultaneously optimize these decisions so that the sustainability targets of the system are met. Moreover, it uncovers the environmental and economic benefits of utilizing warranty replacement service of the online channel of DSC in favor of promoting demand and closing the online loop, in contrast to the prior studies, which have often investigated the demand-promotion effects of warranty. Results of implementing the model showed that the coordination scheme is sophisticated enough to synchronize the economic, environmental, and social gains of the system, leading to significant improvements in the performance indices. The results provide the DSC managers with insights into the way of optimizing the DSC marketing decisions and also utilizing warranty services towards achieving environmental and economic aims in the industries where providing warranty is an indispensable strategy.","Nouri-Harzvili M., Hosseini-Motlagh S.-M., Pazari P.",Optimizing the competitive service and pricing decisions of dual retailing channels: A combined coordination model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119399774&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2021.107789&partnerID=40&md5=ca2e8875973963b5c5c509acc5efdf53
Expert Systems with Applications,"In recent decades, the rapid growth of the global population has caused a significant increase in agricultural and food product demands. Thereby, the production of various items in the agricultural food supply chain network has increased to diminish food security concerns. On the other hand, the excessive production of products has led to various issues, such as greenhouse gas emissions and increased water consumption in farmlands, followed by supply chain-related challenges affecting the intermediaries in the next network levels. In this study, an agricultural food supply chain network under marketing practices is firstly probed by developing a stochastic multi-objective programming model to effectively improve three main pillars of sustainability. A convex robust optimization approach addresses the uncertainty of the farm production capacity and the saffron demands in the supply network. The effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model is certified by a case study on saffron business using the LP-metric method. A metaheuristic-oriented methodology comprising a modified Keshtel Algorithm is adapted to deal with the NP-hardness of the problems. The performance of the proposed solution methods is evaluated by two strategies, a statistical comparison and a supportive tool developed based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods.

"International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences","In recent times, sustainability of supply chains becomes the most interested subject by customers, firms, government bodies, academia, and suppliers as the environmental resources reveal as the most valuable and limited asset for human beings. One of the most important elements determining the performance of sustainable agri-food supply chain business is supplier’s commitment. A mainly inspiring feature in this domain is the wide range of factors influencing supplier selection decision-making process in Triple Bottom Line context must be analyzed. However, it is not easy to completely integrate and measure majority of these factors in a simple optimization model. Therefore, this paper starts with a comprehensive review of literature about supplier selection for sustainable supply chains (SSCs) development. Afterwards, a new two-steps hybrid solution method is suggested. In initial step, a set of criteria for supplier selection process is analyzed built on Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP). The result of the first step is fed in to the second step of the analysis to design a model with multiple objectives for selection process of supplier using fuzzy VIKOR. All three dimensions of sustainability; specifically, factors such as weather, water and soil footprint, energy and material consumption, employment, social services and finally financial performance of supply chain are considered concurrently. The suggested approach generates a comprehensive model to help supply chain managers in supplier selection process. Numerical analysis is completed via exploiting data from a Turkish agri-food company case for validating effectiveness, also and success of the proposed solution. Final analytical results of the analysis provide valuable business policy oriented, operational and practical insights on the influence of economic, environmental, and social sustainability for enhanced supplier relationship management module in sustainable supply chain structure. Moreover, by tracking environmental impact indicators such as, emission and pollution rates, footprint rates, against social and cost indicators it would be possible to perform tradeoff analysis for giving more sustainable decisions on new supply chain investments",Ada N.,Sustainable Supplier Selection in Agri-Food Supply Chain Management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124532478&doi=10.33889%2fIJMEMS.2022.7.1.008&partnerID=40&md5=b1c663c6b0415d44898ddb89a1c5fe6b
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"In recent years, a dramatic increase in Alternative Agri-Food Networks (AAFNs) has been interpreted by experts of the sector as triggered by innovative food supply chains capable to reconnect producers with consumers. Simultaneously, the worldwide growth of consumers’ initiatives towards AAFNs is reducing the distance with producers shortening the supply chain and enhancing its value added. Examples of these consumers’ experiences have been reported in Japan, Europe, the USA, and Canada, and differ according to the degree of participants’ commitment to the logistics and the management of the initiatives. In general terms, these experiences could represent instances of co-production practices involving thousands of citizens who are seeking quality, sustainable, healthy, and ethical products and services reducing the uncertainty of food credence attributes. In this framework, the overall objective of this paper is to contribute to the scanty literature on food associations and cooperatives co-producing private goods with citizens contributing to marketing services such as procurement, storage, pricing, and quality assurance. Specifically, the focus is on the experience of Camilla, a food consumption cooperative that recently established an outlet to stock and sell food and non-food quality goods in Bologna (Italy). Camilla is the first Italian experience of a shop self-managed by its customers - who are also the owners - who practice critical consumption by supplying organic products at fair and sustainable prices while promoting small local productions as well as Fair Trade productions. A deep, participatory, and immersive ethnographic project was carried out between January and October 2019 to understand the functioning, the motivations and the drivers underpinning the process of citizens’ self-organisation in the domain of the food sector. Results provide useful insights on the way in which these innovative AAFNs are organised and on the reasons pushing people to join these initiatives. Key questions emerging from outcomes of the Camilla case study are discussed from an empirical and theoretical point of view.","Sacchi G., Stefani G., Romano D., Nocella G.",Consumer renaissance in Alternative Agri-Food Networks between collective action and co-production,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118871465&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2021.10.018&partnerID=40&md5=3b5633cc28ce8588920454b3978bbb74

"Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks","In recent years, energy experts have paid considerable attention to renewable resource energy. The most widely renewable energy resource, in the world is solar energy. Therefore, optimizing the sustainable supply chain of solar energy production like photovoltaic helps policy-makers in this field. This paper proposes a two-phase method to elaborate a sustainable supply network design model for the solar photovoltaic supply chain. The first phase selects the suitable land for setting up solar photovoltaic power plants by the robust best–worst method, and the second phase develops the photovoltaic supply network design. Additionally, this work deals with the most significant concerns for policy-makers and investors, which are the uncertainty of radiation and demand parameters by a data-driven robust optimization model. As a significant result, it can be obtained with actualized data which the proposed uncertainty approach versus classical closed uncertainty convex sets has less conservatism. This advantage can impose less cost on the system due to its robustness. For validation of the proposed model, an in-depth case study is conducted. Its results show that solar power plants in Yazd, South Khorasan and Kerman are located as strategic decisions, and material flow between suppliers and wafer and ingot plants are determined as operational decisions. Also, on the tactical level, the number of vehicles required to transfer the flow of goods in the supply chain layers based on different time intervals and various transportation modes has been optimized.","Gilani H., Sahebi H., Pishvaee M.S.",A data-driven robust optimization model for integrated network design solar photovoltaic to micro grid,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129982625&doi=10.1016%2fj.segan.2022.100714&partnerID=40&md5=2f646d46fb84e4b51a863760aa66f353
Journal of Environmental Planning and Management,"In recent years, environmental sustainability has stimulated enterprises worldwide to not only develop green and sustainable innovations but also to move toward green and sustainable supply chain management. This study integrated the ideas of green supply chain management (GSCM) and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) to define sustainable green supply chain management (SGSCM). Previous studies on GSCM/SSCM have contributed to research and practice, but few have explored the antecedents and consequences of GSCM/SSCM simultaneously. To address this research gap, we linked ecological modernization (EM) theory with SGSCM and sustainability performance to build a comprehensive research model. A total of 300 valid questionnaires were collected from electrical and electronics firms in Taiwan. The empirical results demonstrated that awareness of and pressure to engage in EM significantly positively affected SGSCM. Moreover, SGSCM significantly positively influenced sustainability performance (i.e. environmental, economic, and social performance). These findings should convince enterprises to actively promote SGSCM.","Huang Y.-C., Huang C.-H.",Examining the antecedents and consequences of sustainable green supply chain management from the perspective of ecological modernization: evidence from Taiwan’s high-tech sector,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110975646&doi=10.1080%2f09640568.2021.1941809&partnerID=40&md5=d50b6279ce83efd6ee7f37101f6f7c9d
International Journal of Production Economics,"In recent years, globalization has highlighted the vital role of sustainable supply chains (SSCs) in the development of organizations and production systems to increase profits. The high-performing SSCs not only increase the organizations’ profit but also guarantee responsiveness and sustainability in the networks. Thus, SSC performance evaluation is of cardinal importance in managing the entire network. Due to the importance of supply chain management, various versions of data envelopment analysis models have been introduced in the literature to evaluate supply chain performance. The inverse data envelopment analysis (IDEA) models have been employed to analyze the sensitivity of parameters and assess the risk of a system to changes in inputs and outputs. The IDEA model measures the impact of these changes on the remaining inputs and outputs by applying changes to one or more inputs or outputs, provided that the efficiency remains constant or improves. In this study, we develop a network IDEA model to evaluate SSCs performance considering the nature of network systems. This model considers different stages of an SSC network based on the importance and priority of each stage over the others. Then, a two-phase method is introduced to solve the proposed model to estimate the inputs and outputs while efficiency improves or remains unchanged. An important feature of the proposed model is to consider the relationships between the internal stages in the IDEA model. Furthermore, the proposed model guarantees the integer values for all parameters. The applicability of the IDEA model is demonstrated using a real case study.","Moghaddas Z., Tosarkani B.M., Yousefi S.",Resource reallocation for improving sustainable supply chain performance: An inverse data envelopment analysis,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135514949&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108560&partnerID=40&md5=f36a29f2ffa846f1afe14b471811e422
IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,"In recent years, market globalization and natural disasters that companies have experienced oblige them to consider technologies from Industry 4.0, and smart manufacturing to improve their supply chain performance and customer satisfaction.

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"In recent years, suppliers in developing countries face the challenge of their low technological and knowledge-related capabilities to enhance sustainability. In addition, buying firms cannot optimize the performance of the whole supply chain because the supplier sustainability practices are unobservable to them and to the public. These two challenges lead to the occurrence of several environmental and social scandals. These scandals pose serious economic and reputational consequences to supply chain members, especially buying firms. Given these challenges and using a sequential game-theoretic methodology, our contribution to the literature on supplier sustainability is to address the effects of supplier code of conduct (SCC) programs on different performance indicators of supply chains. Our analyses indicated that (a) an SCC program can mitigate the supply chain performance deficiencies created by the lack of the integrated optimization of the whole supply chain. Moreover, an SCC program can be superior to some common auditing programs initiated by buying firms. (b) In cases that the supplier’s capability is low or moderate, an SCC program provides a Pareto improvement in its sustainability level and the buying firm’s profit. (c) High consumer awareness threatens the buying firm’s survival in the market. Given this threat, an SCC program indirectly enhances the buying firm’s potential to survive. (d) Buying firms should lower their suppliers’ wholesale prices in exchange for a substantial investment in their suppliers’ capabilities, irrespective of whether or not an SCC program is initiated.","Zarei H., Rasti-Barzoki M.",A game-theoretic approach to designing an optimal code of conduct program to promote supplier sustainability in a supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123465395&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-021-18073-2&partnerID=40&md5=08ae3b899d77a501151a7030544418db
Frontiers in Environmental Science,"In recent years, suppliers’ sustainability has been the primary source of conflict in multinational supply chains. How suppliers from developing nations may accomplish sustainable development and competitive advantage goals has become a tough issue inside the multinational supply chain, particularly in the agri-food cold chain. Using an integrated theory-based perspective, this paper analyzes how sustainable logistics service providers’ supply chain cooperation (MSCC) might drive the sustainable transformation of suppliers in developing nations. Between 1 June 2020 and 15 January 2021, we gathered feedback from 215 Chinese vendors and analyzed and discussed possible models using structural equation modeling. This study demonstrates that the sustainable practices of logistics service providers are the foundation for influencing the collaboration of suppliers in developing nations with regard to sustainability. In addition, the five-stage transnational supply chain cooperation based on the theory of innovation diffusion is an efficient strategy for ensuring the sustainable development of suppliers in developing nations.

Operations Management Research,"In recent years, supply chains seem to be moving more towards reconfiguring their networks to become more profitable. In the times of COVID-19, where the whole supply chains have been disrupted, suppliers are unable to supply, and manufacturers are unable to manufacture because of lockdowns in the various regions around the world. This pandemic can be compared to past earthquakes and tsunamis, as the coronavirus is also a natural disaster. Due to these past disruptions, organizations have taken many precautions and developed risk mitigation strategies to manage them. Because the COVID-19 outbreak shows the importance of new business perspectives like repurposing a viability strategy, that comes with sustainability and reconfigurability. Where reconfiguration focuses on adaptation, which directly means changes in resources and capabilities and repurposing focuses on a quick response solution to address the shortage. In this paper, a study has been done in two phases to model viability in an automobile supply chain during the COVID-19 times. In the first phase, a hybrid Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach is used to get the best criteria and alternatives with sustainability and reconfigurability under consideration. The multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model has been developed in the second phase. Suppliers' weight that is obtained will be used to get the optimal order and allocation. This model will help develop supply chain strategies to cope with situations that hinder the firm's competitiveness.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"In recent years, the rise of e-commerce has prompted the emergence of electronic marketplaces, or e-marketplaces, which act as intermediaries in the buying and selling process, bringing together several vendors to offer a wide range of products and services to customers, generating modalities such as business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C) or consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-marketplaces. E-marketplaces offer advantages such as access to potential buyers, business and product visibility, the reduction of transaction costs, the comparison of offers and prices among competitors, and the ease of business internationalization. However, the success of e-marketplace business models depends on the sustainability of these platforms, which must involve different stakeholders in order to meet economic, environmental, and social objectives. Therefore, this study presents a bibliometric analysis and systematic review of e-marketplaces, open innovation, and sustainability for the last ten, five, and two years. The analysis includes the number, types, and subject areas of documents published each year, as well as considerations such as the most-cited publications and the leading authors, journals, countries, and institutional affiliations. The analysis also includes a study of the relevant concepts in the publications and their relationships, identifying the predominant topics related to e-marketplaces, open innovation, and sustainability. The results indicate a focus on subject areas such as social sciences, environmental sciences, energy, business, management, and accounting, which is consistent with the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability. The findings show that e-marketplaces, open innovation, and sustainability are closely related to concepts such as sustainable development, e-commerce, digital marketing, China (the leading country in terms of publications in all periods), logistics, supply chain management, big data, planning, and decision making. Future works should address traffic congestion and environmental impact, new delivery practices in last-mile logistics, and the motives for users’ engagement in e-marketplaces.

This paper provides a systematic literature review of the various technical implementation aspects of blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems. We apply different drivers for classifying the selected literature, such as (a) the various domains of the available blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems and relevant methodologies applied; (b) the implementation maturity of these traceability systems along with technical implementation details; and (c) the sustainability perspective (economic, environmental, social) prevalent to these implementations. We provide key takeaways regarding the open issues and challenges of current blockchain traceability implementations and fruitful future research areas. Despite the significant volume and plethora of blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems, academia has so far focused on unstructured experimentation of blockchain-associated SC traceability solutions, and there is a clear need for developing and testing real-life traceability solutions, especially taking into account feasibility and cost-related SC aspects.","Dasaklis T.K., Voutsinas T.G., Tsoulfas G.T., Casino F.",A Systematic Literature Review of Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain Traceability Implementations,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125049300&doi=10.3390%2fsu14042439&partnerID=40&md5=12c5922ef34e659bcb262f86f7d13d5f
Sustainability (Switzerland),"In recent years, various organizations have focused on considering the sustainability concept in the supply chain (SC) design. Managers try to increase the sustainability of SCs to achieve a competitive advantage in today’s growing market. Designing a sustainable supply chain (SSC) by integrating economic, social, and environmental dimensions affects the SC’s overall performance. To achieve the SSC, decision makers (DMs) are required to evaluate different strategies and then apply the most effective one to design SC networks. This study proposes an assessment approach based on the network data envelopment analysis (DEA) to choose an efficient strategy for each stage of an SSC network. This approach seeks to provide a sustainable design with DMs to avoid impos-ing additional costs on SCs that result from noncompliance with environmental and social issues. To this end, we consider sustainability-concept-related inputs and outputs in the network DEA model to choose the most efficient strategy for SSC design. The strategy selection process can be-come an important issue, especially when SCs active in a competitive environment. Accordingly, a crucial feature of the presented model is considering the issue of competition to choose the efficient strategy. Furthermore, undesirable outputs and feedbacks and independent inputs and outputs for intermediate stages in the network system are considered to create a structure compatible with the real world. The output of the proposed approach enables DMs to select the appropriate strategy for each stage of the SSC network to maximize the aggregate efficiency of the network.","Moghaddas Z., Tosarkani B.M., Yousefi S.",A Developed Data Envelopment Analysis Model for Efficient Sustainable Supply Chain Network Design,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122124233&doi=10.3390%2fsu14010262&partnerID=40&md5=5bbaaed27dc35bfe25640e1c4affe5d1
Journal of Operations Management,"In response to consumers' growing interest in how products are sourced, produced, and distributed, organizations are increasingly transparent about their supply chain sustainability practices. Supply chain transparency (SCT) efforts are intended to signal positive information about the company to consumers but the benefits are often unclear, especially when consumers receive multiple, but mixed signals that include negative events. We draw on signaling theory to explore how consumers develop impressions of a company's products based on different evaluative dimensions: the positive integrity signal of SCT and the negative capability signal of a product recall. The incongruent signal set creates ambiguity for consumers in assessing product quality and subsequent purchase decisions. We develop two scenario-based experiments to test aspects of interdimensional signal incongruence. Experiment 1 investigates the magnitude of signal incongruity by considering combinations of different levels of SCT and product recall severity. Experiment 2 investigates the temporal effect of the incongruent signals, considering the restorative effect of SCT after a product recall signal has been received. While product recall signals are salient for consumers in shaping perceptions of product quality and purchase intentions across both experiments, we demonstrate the strategic value of SCT as a positive integrity signal to consumers.","Mollenkopf D.A., Peinkofer S.T., Chu Y.",Supply chain transparency: Consumer reactions to incongruent signals,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127957336&doi=10.1002%2fjoom.1180&partnerID=40&md5=425daec41c2582b70d5787f5862a7cef
Land,"In response to the negative effects caused by structures of the dominant agricultural system and new market opportunities, increasing food supply structures have re-emerged in the urban-rural context of industrialized countries in recent years. These food supply structures often accompany new forms of hybrid cooperation models, including actors and institutions that have not shared resources previously. They form new alliances for sustainable transformation in the agri-food sector. Simultaneously, discourse has arisen in science and practice about the sustainability potential of such hybrid cooperation, referring to a lack of critical systematization and the necessity for creating an assessment concept. From the latter, one could draw conclusions about the transformative potential of such cooperation models and their potential to serve as blueprints for other regions. In this conceptual paper, a classification approach derived from social enterprise literature is elaborated, extended, and evaluated, to design a classification of new hybrid cooperation models that allow comparisons between regions and are sensitive to their dynamics. We show in an application how the classification approach, considering the dimensions “actors”, “resources”, and “actions”, serves to discover patterns in the development of short food-supply chain practices, identifying individual transition paths and, thus, making statements about their sustainability and challenges.","Martens K., Rogga S., Zscheischler J., Pölling B., Obersteg A., Piorr A.",Classifying New Hybrid Cooperation Models for Short Food-Supply Chains—Providing a Concept for Assessing Sustainability Transformation in the Urban-Rural Nexus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129043729&doi=10.3390%2fland11040582&partnerID=40&md5=f6cd5a111c0ba20a6c10ff79fbc43503
Land Use Policy,"In Romania, the immediate effects of the pandemic have revealed a strain on food supply chains due to the limitations related to social distancing between producers/deliverers/consumers. The paper aims to identify and analyze the resilience of small farmers in southern Romania (i.e., Bucharest Metropolitan Area) to the new conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. By combining quantitative and qualitative approaches, the analysis focused on the COVID-19 pandemic pre-conditions, impacts and resilience, as well as the post-COVID-19 solutions - the medium- and long-term measures necessary to sustain the effort of the farmers to cope with risks and uncertainties in the future. The study shows a close connection between some pre-existing conditions and farms capacity to become resilient to the shocks caused by the pandemic. Hence, organic farms demonstrated the highest resilience, while leisure and recreational farms the lowest. The research has improved the existing knowledge on the sub-urban farmers as key players of metropolitan agriculture and promoters of sustainability and food security for cities and identified some elements of resilience during COVID-19: reconnecting with local food production, networking, door-to-door delivery, multi-functionality inside the farm, etc. Particularly, backing small farmers to meet market requirements and access digital marketing are among the key measures to support local food systems and short food supply chains to adapt to future shocks.","Grigorescu I., Popovici E.-A., Damian N., Dumitraşcu M., Sima M., Mitrică B., Mocanu I.",The resilience of sub-urban small farming in Bucharest Metropolitan Area in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138110782&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2022.106351&partnerID=40&md5=e16618038361563b9be001c081570f02
Procedia Computer Science,"In sustainable supply chains, visibility represents the extent to which stakeholders within a supply chain have access to or share information that is key or useful to their operations and that is considered of mutual benefit in achieving sustainability objectives. Visibility in sustainable supply chain is important as it helps in the minimization of risk associated with waste and environmental footprint, while simultaneously improving social, ethical, and performance of the chain. The aim of this paper is to explore the variety of factors that influences visibility in sustainable supply chains. The study draws upon the attributes of sustainable supply chain visibility indicated in the literature and uses a focus group of experts to consolidate the attributes into factors that are perceived to influence visibility in the chains. The key principles of sustainable supply chain visibility are found to be underpinned by an extended people, process, and technology (PPT) framework that incorporates context. The study reinforces that achieving high levels of visibility in sustainable supply chains depend to a large extent on quality information, automation, green absorptive capacity, and the sharing of the information amongst the stakeholders in the chain.","Apeji U.D., Sunmola F.T.",Principles and Factors Influencing Visibility in Sustainable Supply Chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127613106&doi=10.1016%2fj.procs.2022.01.353&partnerID=40&md5=e9ea73142c4a8b333b108405b408549c
Agronomy,"In the agri-food sector, the Life Cycle Assessment method (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental impact of a product. Within agri-food products, wine is among the most analysed products, not only for its economic importance but also for the environmental impact of its activity. The paper aims to identify the main trends in the wine sector revolving around environmental evaluation using the LCA method in the academic literature. The aim is to investigate the literature on life cycle assessment analysis of grape and wine production through the systematic grouping of papers into clusters of research. So, the purpose is to discuss the gaps and insights identified by the study in order to aid in the development of a comprehensive state of the art on the topic. Scopus and Web of Science were used to search all articles following a clear and replicable protocol. The results (keywords) were subjected to co-occurrence analysis using VOSviewer, after which the articles were further analysed. Through a bibliographic coupling analysis, the research results were grouped through a network analysis that allowed identifying the research trends on the topic. Three clusters were identified containing the main lines of research on the subject. The results show that nowadays the literature is focusing on concerns related to climate change and consumer awareness on sustainability issues and certifications as well as environmental impacts generated mainly in the production phase in the vineyard.

Energy Policy,"In the context of “carbon peaking” and “carbon neutrality” and significant differences in regional industrial structure of China, this study identified energy and water resources embodied in the top 15 CO2 supply chains of each province in 2017 using the environmentally extended multiregional input–output and structural path analysis method. It also explored the impact of reducing CO2 along these critical supply chains on regional energy and water resources. The study showed that the critical CO2 supply chains in 30 provinces embodied 1859.2 Mt CO2 emissions, accounting for 24% of the total national final consumption. Meanwhile, these supply chains also embodied 354.9 Mt energy and 25033 Mt water resource, accounting for 17% and 5% of total national consumption, respectively. A tradeoff of energy and water resources existed in the low-carbon transition in upstream sectors, while the downstream sector had a great carbon–energy–water synergy potential. The shift of fixed capital investment from conventional construction to new infrastructure with less consumption of both energy and water was conducive to the sustainable development of resources and the environment. Thus, this study provided some suggestions for a low-carbon transition promoting the sustainable management of energy and water resources in all regions.","Hou J.-J., Wang Z., Zhang J.-T., Yu S.-W., Liu L.-C.",Revealing energy and water hidden in Chinese regional critical carbon supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129154961&doi=10.1016%2fj.enpol.2022.112979&partnerID=40&md5=96305baf97c45679bce98d3cfab00b6b
Problems and Perspectives in Management,"In the context of globalization, the process of value creation is becoming more complex, exposed to greater risks for companies, partners, and customers. Moreover, modern digital technologies, such as the use of digital twin technology, can increase the use of geographically dispersed work teams and contribute to sustainable value creation in the future. However, the digital transition creates new organizational models and influences relationships in supply chains, thus affecting structural changes in business models. Hence, the study aims to investigate, from the whole value chain perspective, how the next generation of digital services is affecting business value and changing the business model concept. In addition, this paper discusses the stakeholder and social responsibility value creation perspective on business model for integrated sustainable value creation. To investigate this, it was decided to use a quantitative methodology in the form of questionnaires, which were distributed among different interested parties: two contractors, three suppliers, and an operator. The results indicated that all respondents, such as an operator, shipping companies, and subsea service providers, are positive about future digital technologies, which should ensure environmental sustainability, improve human interaction and communication.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"In the context of the circular economy, this paper focuses on developing an optimal sustainable Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) by considering such Carbon Emission Schemes (CESs) as carbon cap, carbon cap-and-trade, and carbon tax. A risk-based robust mixed-integer linear programming is formulated using a scenario-based Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to deal with demand uncertainty. The results reveal that the model performance is affected by both the Decision-Maker's (DM's) risk-aversion and the CESs. However, in all the CESs, the more conservative the DM, the lower the cost performance, and the greater the cost/solution robustness. The carbon cap-and-trade policy not only has the best cost-performance but, ignoring the very small amount of cost robustness deficit compared to the carbon cap model, can also be considered acceptable in the case of robustness. The cost-saving that the carbon cap-and-trade policy brings to the optimistic DM is greater than that brings to the pessimistic one. However, different levels of the DM's risk aversion have a negligible effect on the cost increase of the carbon tax model compared to the carbon cap one.","Golpîra H., Javanmardan A.",Robust optimization of sustainable closed-loop supply chain considering carbon emission schemes,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122642152&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2021.12.028&partnerID=40&md5=1a7ebe6b869387cf41481521a9f4371d
Sustainability (Switzerland),"In the current context characterized by turbulent market conditions and the increasing relevance of sustainability requirements, reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) offer great potentialities for supply chains and networks. While plenty of contributions have addressed RMSs from a technological and system-specific perspective since the mid-1990s, the research interest for the strategic potentialities of RMSs at the supply chain level is recent and mainly related to building supply chains’ resilience and sustainability. Despite the interest, methods to support supply chains to strategically exploit RMSs are still missing, while being highly needed. In this paper, a method—consisting of an index to assess machines reusability and a mixed integer programming (MIP) algorithm—is provided to support the identification of reusable and reconfigurable machine candidates at the early stage of the strategic network design. The overall method allows machines to be compared based on their reusability and geographical locations. The application of the method, as well as an example referring to the production of emergency devices during the COVID-19 pandemic are reported. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are also discussed, and, among others, strategic parameters related to machines have been identified and elaborated as enablers of supply chain reconfigurability; the proposed method supports practitioners in improving supply chain resilience and sustainability.

Complexity,"In the current context of resource scarcity and increased pollution, enterprises need to better allocate capacity and achieve carbon emission reduction. We examine the optimal decision problem for a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) considering capacity constraints and stochastic demand under a cap-and-trade system. A two-level CLSC comprising a supplier and a manufacturer is established. To make the model more realistic, we treat demand as a random variable, consider the manufacturer's production capacity within a certain upper limit, and allow the manufacturer to make investments to expand capacity to complete production demand. Based on this CLSC, the collection activities of the supplier and manufacturer are considered. Meanwhile, government carbon limits and carbon trading controls on the manufacturer are considered based on carbon reduction by enterprises. Through modeling and analysis, optimal decisions are derived for the amount of capacity investment, level of carbon emission reduction, and collection price variables. The results indicate that supplier collection has a positive effect on the sustainability of the CLSC. Moreover, the government's carbon quota and carbon trading control of manufacturers can effectively reduce the carbon emissions of the CLSC, encourage enterprises to reduce carbon emissions, and improve the sustainability of the CLSC.","Wang J., Shao W.",Optimal Decisions in the Closed-Loop Supply Chain considering Capacity Constraints and Stochastic Demand under the Cap-and-Trade Regulation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137713064&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f2600196&partnerID=40&md5=3da1c091fef0de0bfe844aef33e68502
International Journal of Production Economics,"In the current paper, we develop a quantitative model that examines the impact of upgradable product design on each of the three pillars of sustainability as well as on newly manufactured and remanufactured products' sales. Our model takes into consideration technological innovation, as well as the positioning of heterogeneous consumers towards alternative types, versions and prices of products and related social and cultural issues. Our analysis examines three alternative system settings and it is conducted in two stages; first, we evaluate the quantities of product types and versions available in the market and sequentially, we configure and compare sustainability indices for the alternative systems. Our findings verify that remanufacturing provides improved social, environmental and financial performance compared to the case where only manufacturing is allowed. Product update also outperforms manufacturing, but when compared to remanufacturing it is not always preferable. Interestingly, we find that under some circumstances the system with product update results in the best overall financial performance.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"In the digital age, data-driven credit payment services play a significant role in constructing sustainable supply chains, which can stimulate consumption by reducing consumers’ cash pressure, thereby promoting a sustainable economic development. Our study investigates a dual-channel supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer, wherein the supplier ex-ante decides whether to implement the credit payment policy in the consumer market, and then the retailer determines whether to provide credit payment services in the reselling channel. We uncover that the supplier’s preference toward credit payment policy is not unidirectional. Specifically, the supplier establishes credit payment policy in the consumer market unless the discount of cash opportunity cost is lower than the price discount of credit payment services. Moreover, we find that, under credit payment policy of the supplier, the retailer opts to provide credit payment services when the discount of cash opportunity cost is higher than the price discount of credit payment services. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that, compared with non-credit payment policy, credit payment policy may restrict the development of economics sustainability, which undermines the whole supply chain.","Huang X., Xu L., Liu J., Huang Y.",Enhancing Economic Sustainability with Credit Payment Services in a Dual-Channel Supply Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134054299&doi=10.3390%2fsu14148295&partnerID=40&md5=fea05fd115451b1762c549f1a0e5ae88
Business Strategy and the Environment,"In the era of circular economy (CE), sustainability in the supply chain provides a competitive edge over other organizations in a globally competitive environment. There have been an increasing number of studies in sustainable supply chain practices in the recent past. Limited studies have been done to identify the key strategic factors for sustainable operations of automotive sector in context to developing countries like India. The primary goal of this research is to undertake a thorough assessment and give a brief understanding of the barriers of sustainability in the automotive supply chain. Various barriers are identified from experts' interviews and past academic literature. An integrated approach comprising of the “decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method” (DEMATEL) and “interpretive structural modelling” (ISM) method is employed to develop a contextual and hierarchical relationship among the identified barriers. The lack of awareness concerning reverse logistics adoption has the greatest causal effect. This is followed by a lack of information sharing on sustainable practices and complexity in measurement and monitoring of suppliers' environmental activities. To ensure the robustness of the model, sensitivity analysis has been also performed. The novelty of this work is that it identified several barriers towards a sustainable supply chain in automotive sector with a special focus on India.

Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management,"In the face of unexpected changes in their dynamic business environment, purchasing and supply chain (SC) managers have been challenged to boost SC resilience while maintaining their sustainability concerns. In this changing environment, this paper aims to explore: (1) how (social) sustainability affects SC resilience and (2) what the role of purchasing is for SC resilience. Through a dynamic capability view as the theoretical lens, we investigate whether and how an inclusive purchasing programme could enhance SC resilience capabilities to cope with the Covid-19 outbreak. We developed a Case study with various SC members of a multinational cosmetics company that, despite suffering from a sudden demand disruption during the outbreak, maintained its sustainability actions. The results show that four operational SC resilience capabilities were amplified: ‘visibility’, ‘adaptability’, ‘collaboration’ and ‘financial strength’. In addition, a new capability entitled ‘empowerment’ was mobilised during this period. These factors helped the inclusive purchasing maintenance and were essential to supporting social sustainability. In addition, our results show that sustainable PSM, which is overlooked in the literature, is key for SC resilience.

Annals of Operations Research,"In the globalization era, assessing the resilience and sustainability of suppliers is a key issue in supply chains (SCs). The literature survey shows data envelopment analysis (DEA) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) are the two most effective approaches for evaluating suppliers. To take full advantage of these powerful approaches, we propose a novel data envelopment analytical hierarchy process (DEAHP) model. To this end, first, we combine the multiplier form of the slacks-based measure (SBM) model with goal programming (GP) and a common set of weights model to reduce the possibility of alternative optimal solutions. Then, we try to reduce the number of alternative optimal solutions of CSW. Next, to find the range of optimal weights, by setting the optimal objective functions to a constant value, minimum and maximum weights of inputs and outputs are calculated. Finally, to choose the weights, three strategies are suggested. Using the optimal weights, we calculate the pairwise comparison matrix and rank suppliers.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"In the globalized world, one significant challenge for organizations is minimizing risk by building resilient supply chains (SCs). This is important to achieve a competitive advantage in an unpredictable and ever-changing environment. However, the key enablers of such resilient and sustainable supply chain management are less explored in construction projects. Therefore, the present research aims to determine the causality among the crucial drivers of resilient and sustainable supply chain management (RSSCM) in construction projects. Based on the literature review, 12 enablers of RSSCM were shortlisted. Using the systems thinking (ST) approach, this article portrays the interrelation between the 12 shortlisted resilience enablers crucial for sustainability in construction projects. The causality and interrelationships among identified enablers in the developed causal loop diagram (CLD) show their dynamic interactions and impacts within the RSSCM system.

Neural Computing and Applications,"In the information technology era, the upstream and downstream of the supply and demand industrial chain constitute an “Internet + ” supply chain scenario of logistics, capital flow and information flow with information computing capabilities such as lending, payment and settlement. The high-quality growth of the economy requires the optimization of the industrial chain structure, while the factor income distribution reflects the profit level of every link in the chain. This paper establishes a dual industrial chain model composed of capital-intensive and labour-intensive industrial chains. Additionally, it discusses and explores the optimal balance condition of the industrial chain in a closed economy and an open economy. The results show that industrial chain sustainability depends on the relative size between the chain’s establishment cost and profit—the capital stock (establishment cost) of the industrial chain has a positive (negative) effect on a high (low)-efficiency department. In a closed economy, the capital income contribution completely depends on the relative price of capital goods, and the positive or negative relationship between the two depends on the elasticity of substitution of final products in the two industrial chains. In an open economy, foreign trade gives rise to labour reallocation among departments and promotes the adoption of comparatively advanced departments in the industrial chain model.","Bai J., Zheng A., Gai L.",A dual industrial chain model and optimal equilibrium condition analysis based on information computation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137469995&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-022-07749-6&partnerID=40&md5=96b64d8ab826f4929bf68f6b5d174cbd
Frontiers in Psychology,"In the last 10 years, organizations and researchers have recognized the importance of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) because of the consumers, -profit and non-profit organizations, laws and regulations, and consumer social and corporate responsibilities. Supplier selection, environmental effects such as social cooperation, and other SSCM programmes, can all help to achieve the “triple bottom line (TBL)” of economic, environmental, and social advantages. Sustainable supplier selection (SSS) and firm performance are important factors in supply chain management (SCM). Organizations will traditionally consider a new framework when evaluating SSS performance to obtain all-encompassing criteria/sub-criteria of the sustainability index by encapsulating sustainability. This paper compiles 12 subcriteria for three sustainability pillars, namely economic, environmental, and social performance. Despite the fact that many articles on SSS and evaluation were published during COVID-19, there seems to be little research on sustainability issues to date. The goal of this study is to suggest a fuzzy multicriteria approach to SSCM planning. Additionally, using the TBL method, the problem of determining a current model for SSS in the supply chain was investigated. The linguistic value of the subjective preference of experts is represented by triangular fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) is proposed to use standard weights to rank SSS for qualitative performance evaluation. COVID-19, on the other hand, has a detrimental impact on SSS and company results. The organization’s performance suffers as a result of the COVID-19 shutdown. The proposed method is demonstrated using an example.

Agriculture and Human Values,"In the mid twenty-tens, many major food companies committed to sustainably source their priority ingredients, including North American commodity crops. With deadlines set for the decade’s end, companies joined multi-stakeholder initiatives and developed standards, metrics, and other assessment tools to help them track and drive progress. In short, they embarked on the sort of corporate supply chain governance that agri-food scholars have long studied. But how would this governance happen, especially in the commodity supply chains where companies knew and controlled little about upstream production? Treating supply chain governance as not just a corporate undertaking but also the work of mid-level sustainability managers, this paper examines the practical skills and knowledge, or mētis, employed by managers in their efforts to win the support of colleagues, farmers, and other supply chain actors.

Waterlines,"In the Oslo Accord-defined Area C of the West Bank, approximately 11,000 Palestinians are unserved by the water network, forced to rely on water trucking at extremely high prices. In response to this situation, Gruppo di Volontariato Civile (GVC), in partnership with UNICEF, created a programme to subsidize water trucking that alleviates water scarcity while enhancing the sustainability of water service delivery, equitability of tariffs, and predictability of demand. Established in 2014, the programme now covers all the water-vulnerable communities in the West Bank and has reached 35,000 people. The programme links humanitarian and development interventions by using a contiguum approach, where the humanitarian provision of trucked water is accompanied by the construction of water infrastructure and the creation of a multilevel water trucking governance system that defines the roles and responsibilities of all national, regional, and local actors in the water supply chain. By embedding water trucking into the Palestinian Water Authority's normal activities, the programme is designed to escape a cycle of chronic emergency humanitarian response, in line with the national water sector reform agenda. Eventually, the international donor funding on which the programme depends should be phased out by implementing an equitable, universal water tariff schedule across the entire West Bank, with rates set high enough to subsidize the provision of reliable, safe, and affordable water to the vulnerable residents of Area C.","Cesari G., Johnson S.O., Cancelliere G., Von Medeazza G.",How a water trucking governance mechanism in the West Bank enhances equity and sustainability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126289117&doi=10.3362%2f1756-3488.18-00036OA&partnerID=40&md5=22deeca075166c4ad54fc9fc6d46d5d1

Linings based on this technology have a reduced CO2 footprint of up to 20%. However, a business model based on a circular economy requires additional developments to be implemented in the organization. As spent refractory linings are classified as waste, the legal framework of the supply chain must be adapted.

Proceedings of the Combustion Institute,"In the present energy transition scenario, ammonia is considered a valuable candidate as energy-dense carrier with neutral or even negative carbon balance. However, the potential high NOx emissions and the reduced oxidation process stability, at least when conventional combustion plants are used, can burden its wide utilization on large scales. In this context, MILD Combustion, due to its inherent characteristics, may greatly improve combustion stability and keep the NOx emissions at an acceptable level. On the other hand, the addition of low or no-carbon fuels from biomasses and wastes, more reactive than ammonia, may be beneficial in further improving its combustion performance and the global sustainability of the energy supply chain. In this respect, the present work analyzes the sustainability and combustion performance of binary mixtures of ammonia and low-molecular-weight alcohols in a cyclonic burner, where MILD conditions are attained by means of a strong internal recirculation, and compares them with those obtained with NH3/methane blends. Results highlighted that NH3/alcohols mixtures ensure a stable oxidation process in a wide range of operational parameters without compromising the system performance. Moreover, they showed a significant reduction of NOx emissions for NH3/alcohols mixtures, especially for fuel-lean conditions, when compared to NH3/methane blends. Experimental data were also corroborated by chemical kinetic modeling results to provide some insights on the peculiar NOx formation routes when blends of different nature are used, highlighting the interaction between carbon and nitrogen fuels kinetics.","Ariemma G.B., Sorrentino G., Sabia P., Ragucci R., de Joannon M.","MILD Combustion of Methanol, Ethanol and 1-Butanol binary blends with Ammonia",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139834924&doi=10.1016%2fj.proci.2022.08.032&partnerID=40&md5=31311441b5c766214d7c04ae8fc275c4
Annals of Operations Research,"In the present era of the circular economy, sustainable service quality has become an order winning criteria for all logistics provider across the world. The selection of appropriate logistics service providers (LSPs) greatly influences the performance of supply chains in terms of sustainability indicators. Most of the previous studies have not considered sustainability measures in the evaluation of logistics service providers. Therefore, the uniqueness of this study is that we are proposing a framework for selecting the best logistics provider based on sustainable service quality. Total seventeen attributes related to sustainable service quality are finalized based on literature review and subsequent focused group discussions. Through a questionnaire-based survey, data from 150 customers of LSPs are collected. Data is analysed through factor analysis and seventeen attributes of sustainable service quality are categorized into five factors namely Commitment, Competence, Communication, Creativity & Customization, and Coordination and Collaboration. It is named as a 5C framework. This framework is further used to illustrate the selection of best LSP based on sustainable service quality. Listed attributes are evaluated through hybrid Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) techniques. This decision-making framework is illustrated with the help of a real-life case study. Sensitivity analysis is also done to validate the robustness of the proposed framework. From this study, it has been observed that the development of competencies for the adoption of sustainable practices should be the thrust area for logistics service providers. Findings imply that the logistics providers should give more focus on sustainable network optimization, response time reduction, reliable green services, flexibility in green processes, and development of mutual trust with all stakeholders to become the first choice of their customers.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"In the world of environmental scarcity, customers are keen to invest in a supply chain player who makes environmentally sound choices. Owing to this, the present study develops a production inventory model with demand dependent on greening degree and price. The production process is faulty and thereby some fraction of defective items gets piled up along with the perfect products. Efficient management of defectives is indeed crucial in achieving sustainable development goals. Thus, the proposed study develops two models to handle the fraction of defective goods. The first model considers the salvaging of the defectives, which is quite applicable to the goods that are not suitable for any further dispensation. The second model considers the reworking option, which is pragmatic for most of the reworkable inventory goods. A sustainability assessment of both models is done and findings suggest the better performance of the second model. Numerical analysis is presented to impart the validity of the proposed study. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is also done to demonstrate model features. The developed study is inspired by the recent advancements in the global supply chains in terms of greening levels. The key contribution lies in the framework of decision-making of various manufacturers and analyzing the impact of greening degree and pricing. With dual maneuver options for the defective items, the problem throws thought-provoking insights into the strategies of manufacturers and their vital decisions.

Depending upon quality, the collector collects the used products and forwards to the manufacturer for remanufacturing. The collector offers a reward or incentive to consumers to influence them to return the used items. The shortfall amount of collected used items, if any, is meet up by the supplier by supplying fresh raw materials. In three separate cases viz centralized, decentralized and revenue-sharing contract, optimal incentives for end-customers and optimal profits of supply chain members are determined. The revenue-sharing contract is implemented in two different settings - one including the supplier and the other one excluding the supplier.

IISE Transactions,"In this article, we develop a supply chain sourcing model that incorporates both sustainability and operational performance measures. The model selects suppliers and determines sustainability investments and order allocations among the selected suppliers. High sustainability performance, as well as cost efficiency, is achieved while a high operational performance level is maintained. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear bi-objective integer-programming model, discover the model’s special features, and propose an effective and computationally efficient algorithm to solve it. To quantify a supply chain’s sustainability performance, we adopt the Environmental, Social, and Governance index. Instead of searching for just one sourcing solution, we find the Pareto-optimal set of effective solutions. Numerical tests verify that our algorithm outperforms an existing sourcing algorithm in terms of computational efficiency. A simulation of Apple’s sourcing decisions demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in business practice.

International Series in Operations Research and Management Science,"In this chapter, we attempt to develop an integrated framework for simultaneously addressing the supplier selection and order allocation problems, considering the trade-off between supply chain sustainability (in environmental, social, and economic terms) related risks and procurement cost. First, we identify supply chain sustainability-related risks for evaluating suppliers based on practice and an extensive literature review. Secondly, these criteria are used to assess suppliers’ sustainability risk performance, using principal component analysis. Then, the min-max normalization is applied to the principal component analysis scores to generate the suppliers’ adjusted sustainability risk performance scores, which are then utilized to select a set of qualified suppliers. Subsequently, the specific supplier selection and order allocation decisions are determined via a bi-objective mixed-integer programming model, which attempts to maximize the supply chain’s sustainability performance while minimizing the procurement cost. This proposed framework forms a decision support system for our sustainable supplier selection and order quantity allocation. Finally, we present an illustrative example of outsourcing contract manufacturers in the apparel industry to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in practice.","Ogunranti G.A., Banerjee A.",Balancing Sustainability Risks and Low Cost in Global Sourcing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139518597&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-09183-4_11&partnerID=40&md5=20976717be2a7d7e809a24aa0dcabaf6
IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,"In this competitive and technology driven world, businesses are striving to gain benefits of environmental sustainability and energy conservation by implementing the latest technologies in their supply chains. A promising way of evaluating the environmental performance of a product or a process is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) modelling, but the reliability of LCA results is mostly compromised due to the lack of real data from upstream and downstream supply chains. Our research aim is to drive LCA modelling through Blockchain Technology (BCT) and internet-of-things which have the capability to record reliable, transparent, and secure data from across the supply chain. The modified LCA model will provide various industries with the quantified benefits of BCT in terms of industrial emissions reduction. This conference paper reflects the 1st stage of research where we carried out a detailed literature review on potential use of blockchain technology in green supply chain management and based on the findings, we developed an integrative framework architecture for the supply chain of a supermarket product. In the next phase, the integration of BCT and LCA will be studied in food supply chains using a supermarket case study of Walmart-IBM developed blockchain consortium.","Asif M.S., Gill H.",Blockchain Technology and Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) - Improving Environmental and Energy Performance in Multi-echelon Supply Chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126337873&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f952%2f1%2f012006&partnerID=40&md5=2450ae604edb7d90046099404208808f
Frontiers in Public Health,"In this contemporary world, the words data and sustainability play a crucial role in determining the financial budgets of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Usually, it is stated that the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is directly proportional to the growth and sustainability factor of the nation. The economic sustainability of a nation is dependent on appropriate functioning of SMEs. Any kind of direct impact on the working of SMEs will have its impact on the whole economy of a nation. There are different factors such as lack of financial capacity, low market demands, restrictions with regard to the capital, and barriers in the supply chain that affect the sustainability of SMEs worldwide. Nevertheless, small, and medium sized enterprises around the world are greatly investing on skills, innovation, and other capital related resources to mark up the demands of the external market. The main objective of this study is to examine the financial budgets of technology-based SMEs from the perspective of sustainability and big data. For this, the study collects data through a questionnaire from 1,800 Small and Medium Sized Enterprises. Based on a detailed and careful examination of the data, only 1,400 of the responses received were considered valid (79.75%). To test the hypothesis stated, the study employs structural equation modeling. This will help the researcher to examine the direct effect of financial budget and technology adaption of SMEs from the perspective of sustainability and big data. Results of the study stated that SMEs sustainability and big data are directly and positively related to the financial budget planning of technology-based SMEs. The study also found that big data plays an important role in the businesses, specifically for their own growth.

Business Perspectives and Research,"In this Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), sustainable development for business firms depends on maintaining sustained performance and environmental sustainability to a great extent. The current study discovers the impact of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices on business performance and the environmental sustainability of a developing country, Bangladesh. Cost and profit are the two important indicators of business performance. On the other hand, environmental sustainability is expressed by waste disposal, resource consumption, and greenhouse gas emission. Primary data were collected through the distribution of web links and direct interaction with the participants of different firms practicing GSCM practices in Bangladesh. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Hypotheses were formulated and evaluated accordingly. This study found that the impact of implementation of GSCM practices differs with respect to cost, profit, waste disposal, resource consumption, and greenhouse gas emission. GSCM practices have a statistically significant impact on cost, waste disposal, resource consumption, and greenhouse gas emission. The impact of GSCM practices on profit was statistically insignificant. It was found that lack of IT implementation, high cost of waste disposal, uncertainty and competition in the market, resistance to change, and lack of top management support are the major barriers to implement GSCM practices in Bangladesh.","Rupa R.A., Saif A.N.M.",Impact of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) on Business Performance and Environmental Sustainability: Case of a Developing Country,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099765955&doi=10.1177%2f2278533720983089&partnerID=40&md5=3e3f6e26face27837de7bb3dae628ae4
Soft Computing,"In this paper a supply chain network for producing and distributing the dairy products of a case study is designed. A supply chain with suppliers, potential plants, potential distribution centers, customers, potential collection/recycling centers, potential disposal centers, and multi-mode transportation under cost, environmental-, and social-based objective functions is formulated mathematically. In the proposed formulation, according to the uncertain nature of the problem in real-world situations, some of the parameters are considered as intuitionistic fuzzy values. In addition to the required location and allocation decisions, two main difficulties of the proposed problem are its uncertain nature and its multi-objectivity. To overcome such difficulties, a method considering the acceptance degree of fuzzy constraints violated is used to convert the fuzzy formulation to its equivalent crisp form. As a novelty, this method for the first time is modified for intuitionistic fuzzy values. Then the obtained multi-objective crisp formulation is solved by five multi-objective optimization approaches of the literature. At the end the data of the case study from Iran are used to evaluate the proposed crisp formulation and comparison of the multi-objective solution approaches.","Behzadianfar M., Eydi A., Shahrokhi M.",A sustainable closed loop supply chain design problem in intuitionistic fuzzy environment for dairy products,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118304532&doi=10.1007%2fs00500-021-06409-6&partnerID=40&md5=6806f81749a40eac6b92cfdbd1aed969

Sustainability (Switzerland),"In this paper, a model and a set of indicators for evaluating the sustainability in swine supply chains are presented and discussed. Using the Delphi method, environmental, social and economic indicators were identified (namely environmental performance indicators to evaluate soil, water, air, energy and environmental practices; social performance indicators related to human capital and social interaction; and economic performance indicators that address labor remuneration and return on investment). Subsequently, the proposed sustainability assessment model was applied for validation purposes in three different companies belonging to the swine supply chain in the southern region of Brazil. This study differs from previous ones by focusing on the sustainability assessment of the upstream and downstream of the supply chain, which are responsible for significant impacts. The performance of the studied companies from the three triple bottom-line (TBL) dimensions is significantly different. Both negative and positive impacts were found to be related to most of the specific metrics. The economic dimension presented a better performance than the environmental and social ones. Furthermore, there was a predominance of negative impacts in the environmental dimension, in relation to the soil, water, air, and energy indicators. Thus, specific actions, strategies, and policies must be designed for the different companies towards an effective and comprehensive sustainability throughout the swine supply chain. The proposed model can be extended to other companies in the same supply chain, replicated in other livestock and agribusiness industries and supply chains (such as cattle and poultry), and it can be used in different locations and including additional indicators and metrics.","Kruger S.D., Zanin A., Durán O., Afonso P.",Performance Measurement Model for Sustainability Assessment of the Swine Supply Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137684053&doi=10.3390%2fsu14169926&partnerID=40&md5=dfbf362da6ede78da5c89c8b94fa49e5
SAGE Open,"In this paper, the customer to manufacturer (C2M) platform in e-commercial business which connects the customers and the manufacturers is studied. The platform is organized in a centralized collaboration framework where an e-commercial company and multiple manufacturers form a collaborative alliance to satisfy the product orders of multiple customers and maximize a total profit of the alliance. The key issue of the C2M platform is to seek a fair allocation of the profit among the manufacturers. A profit allocation mechanism is proposed for the platform that can assure the stability of the alliance and the sustainability of the platform. The mechanism is based on core allocation and considers each manufacturer’s contribution in fulfilling orders. The effectiveness of the mechanism is evaluated by numerical experiments on 60 instances generated from real data of Alibaba. The experiment results display that the participation of more manufacturers in the C2M platform is profitable. The proposed mechanism can create a profit allocation that keeps in the core in 31 of 60 instances and produce a feasible profit allocation in other 29 instances, which is more reasonable than the current mechanism of C2M platform and easier applied in practice.","Dai B., Li F., Liu Y.",A Profit Allocation Mechanism for Customer-to-Manufacturer Platform in e-Commercial Business,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131209917&doi=10.1177%2f21582440221094590&partnerID=40&md5=fe7d03bf58eaf6614a3dd2a355eee27c
European Journal of Operational Research,"In this paper, we develop a supply chain network model in which firms compete noncooperatively in an oligopolistic manner in discrete time periods over a finite planning horizon. Each firm makes a strategic decision regarding its target sustainability rating and tactical decisions of product flows, in the presence of consumer preferences for sustainability and a variety of environmental policies. Such policies include ecological taxes for different types of pollution, subsidies for pollution control, command-and-control policies, as well as hybrid approaches with different possible combinations of policy instruments. Furthermore, our model captures dynamic changes in not only the consumer purchasing behavior, but also the operational costs and environmental pollution, as well as government environmental policies. A series of numerical examples evaluate the impacts of consumer preferences for sustainability and environmental policies on firms’ profitability and their environmental footprint. The results indicate that firms will improve sustainable operations as long as it is financially valuable for them to do so, which mandates governments and firms to educate consumers about sustainability. Numerical examples also reveal under which environmental policies sustainability can be profitable.","Yu M., Cruz J.M., Li D., Masoumi A.H.",A multiperiod competitive supply chain framework with environmental policies and investments in sustainable operations,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112074033&doi=10.1016%2fj.ejor.2021.07.028&partnerID=40&md5=9f8d4ba2a98d11fd8f97679c85768480

Our results imply that academic research on the CE focuses heavily on theoretical conceptualizations and technological solutions. However, these advancements alone are unlikely to help prevent from ecological collapse. With this observation in mind, we explore the potential held by a more relational, action-based approach to support a faster and more efficient transition from the linear economy to the CE. A useful combination of several bibliometric techniques gave us valuable references for re-focusing this area of science to adopt action-oriented research where a group of stakeholders collaborates and co-creates solutions. An analysis of valuable action-oriented CE studies reveals that scholars focus on the techno-economic aspect, where they develop ways to create optimal circular material and energy flows and co-design processes for products/services, as well as the organizational aspect, where they study self-sustainable community networks and participatory governance.

Here, we use a sample of 25 Indian firms listed for their sustainability performances in the Thomson Reuters Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) scores. The sustainability performance data have been accessed from the Bloomberg terminal, where the overall sustainability performance on ESG is measured as a discounted score on ESG considering various controversies on ESG reported for the firm. And for the study, we associate financial data using the profit indicators of firms. We perceive that the sustainable supply chain practices considering environmental, social and governance performances may not positively impact the financial performance measured by the Return on Asset (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE), during the considered period of five years for the study. We construct the empirical model and use Partial Least Square (PLS) regression modeling to analyze the results.

Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,"In this study, a multi-objective formulation is proposed for designing a supply chain of perishable products including suppliers, plants, distributors, and customers under sustainable development. In addition to the studies of the literature, direct shipment between producers and customers and also alternative products possibility are allowed. In this problem, the objectives, such as facilities establishment costs, transportation costs, negative environmental impacts, and social impact (fixed and variable employment rates) are optimized simultaneously. As in real situations, most of the transportation activities of such supply chain are performed by hiring transportation devices, the open routing logic is applied to form the traveling path of each hired transportation device. Furthermore, the possibility of direct shipment from the plants to the customers is considered in order to increase profitability of the plants. Because of the NP-hard nature of the supply chain design problems, some meta-heuristic solution approaches of the literature are modified to multi-objective form and applied to solve the problem. Several test problems from small to large sizes are generated randomly to evaluate the meta-heuristic algorithms. As a result, among the proposed algorithms, the multi-objective gray wolf optimizer (MGWO) performs better than others by considering four well-known evaluation metrics.

Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,"In this study, we examine how the use of blockchain technology deters less sustainable products’ entry (LSPE) in the cross-border supply chains in which the entrant produces less sustainable products and enters into the incumbent's market. We identify that when the blockchain adoption cost exceeds a threshold, the entry can be blocked by mandatory blockchain adoption and the incumbent enjoys the monopoly position; when the blockchain adoption cost falls into an intermediate range, deterrence needs not only the use of blockchain technology but also price distortion by the incumbent; when the blockchain adoption cost is sufficiently low, the incumbent must compete with the entrant because blockchain technology is no longer effective for deterrence. Moreover, we examine how government intervention (tariff or subsidy) affects LSPE and find that both tariff and subsidy schemes can enhance the value of adopting blockchain technology to prevent LSPE. If the blockchain adoption cost is moderate, then levying tariffs on LSPE can achieve an economic and environment-dominating outcome, but the subsidy scheme cannot.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"In this work, different alternatives to conventional tertiary treatment of pulp and paper (P&P) wastewater (WW), i.e., physicochemical coagulation-flocculation, were investigated to enhance the environmental and economic sustainability of industrial wastewater treatment. In particular, following a preliminary characterization of secondary effluents, cloth filtration and adsorption were studied, the former by pilot-scale tests, while the latter at laboratory scale. An economic analysis was finally accomplished to verify the full-scale applicability of the most promising technologies. Cloth filtration showed excellent total suspended solids (TSS) removal efficiency (mean 81% removal) but a very limited influence on chemical oxygen demand (COD) (mean 10% removal) due to the prevalence of soluble COD on particulate COD. Adsorption, instead, led to a good COD removal efficiency (50% abatement at powdered activated carbon—PAC—dosage of 400 mg/L). The economic analysis proved that adsorption would be convenient only if a local low-cost (100 €/ton) adsorbent supply chain was established. Ultrafiltration was considered as well as a potential alternative: its huge capital cost (19 M€) could be recovered in a relatively short timeframe (pay-back time of 4.7 years) if the ultrafiltrated effluent could be sold to local industries.","Mainardis M., Mulloni S., Catenacci A., Danielis M., Furlani E., Maschio S., Goi D.",Sustainable Alternatives for Tertiary Treatment of Pulp and Paper Wastewater,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130730313&doi=10.3390%2fsu14106047&partnerID=40&md5=3c09ba74772cd1b4c236dcdcc8f4b1de

Sustainability (Switzerland),"In today’s era of industrial economics, warehousing is a complex process with many moving parts and is required to contribute productively to the success of supply chain management. There-fore, risk management in warehouses is a crucial point of contention to ensure sustainability with global supply chain processes to accommodate good productivity performance. Therefore, this study aims to analyse risks factors that affect warehouse productivity performance towards a systematic identification of critical factors that managers should target to sustain and grow warehouse produc-tivity. This study utilised a traditional risk matrix framework, integrating it with the Borda method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique to produce an innovative risk matrix model. The results indicate that from the constructed ten warehouse operation risk categories and 32 risk factors, seven risk categories, namely operational, human, market, resource, financial, security and regulatory, including 13 risk factors were prioritised as the most critical risks impacting warehouse productivity performance.

After that, two collaborative models, viz. manufacturer-retailer collaboration and manufacturer-TPC collaboration, are developed for improving channel performance under the manufacturer-led Stackelberg gaming approach. Numerical results disclose that the government subsidy to consumers provides better functionality to channel individuals, consumers, and the environment. If the government considers imposing a tax, the RPM can help to improve channel execution marginally. A collaborative strategy between the manufacturer and the retailer under government taxation and RPM becomes the most efficient strategy for enhancing the triple bottom line of sustainability.","Mondal C., Giri B.C.",Tax-subsidy or reward-penalty?

ECS Transactions,"In today's environment, businesses are looking into cutting-edge strategies to improve their supply chain's cost and operational effectiveness. Cloud computing appears to be a promising technology that can help with this optimization by providing infrastructure, platform, and software solutions for the entire supply chain network over the Internet. The use of cloud-based services in supply chain management has financial and operational benefits, but all supply chain stakeholders should be aware of potential dangers and restrictions. Cloud computing can improve supply chain collaboration and infrastructure needs by allowing for more flexible outsourcing of software. Rather than sustaining and paying for maximum use, this technology proposes an approach that allows for flexibility in adding on the way, depending on the entire business process and supply chain network model. Aside from the normal tech hype, cloud computing has the potential to be an ideal technology for supporting and managing a constantly changing and dynamic network, and thus for supply chain management (SCM). This paper provides an overview of cloud-based supply chain management. A quick introduction to cloud technologies is given first. The factors of cloud computing that affect supply chain activities are then examined, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of incorporating this technology into current supply chains.

Scientia Iranica,"In today's world, production and distribution of products in supply chain systems should be done with careful consideration of the environmental and social issues as global concerns about the emission of greenhouse gases within the manufacturing processes and overlooking the major needs of the public are rising. In this regard, the present paper proposes a new multi-objective model for the Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) problems by incorporating lot sizing and considering lean, agility, and sustainability factors, simultaneously. Furthermore, a robust possibilistic programming approach was applied for handling the uncertainty of the model. To increase the responsiveness of the system, a Fuzzy C-means Clustering Method (FCCM) was employed in order to select the potential locations based on the proximity to local customers. A new hybrid metaheuristic algorithm was developed in order to improve efficiency of the model in dealing with large-size problems and assess the impact of using a single-based initial solution as the income for the second phase of the proposed hybrid algorithm. In addition, to ensure effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, another well-known metaheuristic algorithm was developed. The results achieved by experiments on different test problems approved the superiority of the hybrid metaheuristic algorithm in achieving proper solutions.","Aghamohamadi-Bosjin S., Rabbani M., Manavizadeh N.",A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for data driven leagile sustainable closed-loop supply chain modeling under disruption risk,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134382633&doi=10.24200%2fsci.2020.53949.3506&partnerID=40&md5=f7b968df9214462860c9cee1d4300596
International Journal of Sustainable Transportation,"In view of the pressing need to reduce the negative environmental impact of freight transportation we argue that it is essential to take account of the organization of the freight transportation system when considering how to address various individual activities and parts of the system. To support a transition to a more sustainable freight transportation system this paper examines the way in which different parts of the system interact and the way this can impact the scope for profound change. Taking loosely coupled systems (Weick, 1976) as a starting point, we scrutinize the couplings within and between three system layers of the freight transportation system: the supply chain layer, the transportation layer, and the infrastructure layer. In addition, we address two interfaces connecting these layers: the market for transportation services, and the traffic using the infrastructure. We find that tight couplings dominate in the supply chain and infrastructure layers and that these couplings depend on loose couplings in the transportation layer and the two interfaces. The pattern of couplings identified in the freight transportation system can explain several positive outcomes, such as flexibility and efficiency. But there are also major negative aspects of the loosely coupled nature of the system that create resistance to change and present a barrier in the drive for increased sustainability. The paper concludes that the identified couplings and system features have important implications for policies aiming to change the freight transportation system in ways that lead to significant reduction in the reliance on oil.","Browne M., Dubois A., Hulthén K.",Transportation as a loosely coupled system: a fundamental challenge for sustainable freight transportation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135268391&doi=10.1080%2f15568318.2022.2103756&partnerID=40&md5=bddc871256d22d6c6685c1b8cd22a303
Sustainability (Switzerland),"INCOM Egypt has undergone automation in some processes where critical aspects of its operations are transformed and automated. This paper presents an overview of INCOM Egypt processes using Ould Riva and analyses the process of ‘handling a product’. It aims to demonstrate effective automation of the production of wires and cables process accompanied to Industry 4.0 while considering environmental and economic sustainability goals that were inhibited by COVID-19 restrictions. Ould’s Riva method is used to analyse the production process of wires and cables to propose improvements for automating the process. Business process modelling is utilised to study the processes for clearer understating. The flow of information within the process is also analysed to integrate the production process with other processes and supply chains, which helps to identify which production activities can be automated and mainstreamed into the information flow to achieve environmental and economic sustainability. The context of INCOM Egypt, as a case study, is presented along with the Riva model of its operations. The paper identifies the before, i.e., As-Is process, and after, i.e., To-Be Process, automation of the ‘handle a product’ process using the Role Activity Diagram (RAD). The process involved redesigning and improving different activities to increase resource-use efficiency to participate in achieving the goals of sustainability. The focus of this paper is to investigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on sustainability and to examine the accomplishments of process automation of wire production towards environmental and economic sustainability. The results of the research reveal a relationship between business process modelling and sustainability. Moreover, automation of processes (Industry 4.0) is found to reduce the negative effect of COVID-19 on production. A triangulation between process modelling, process automation (Industry 4.0), and sustainability was determined. Each one is reinforcing and impacting one another. The RAD model demonstrates that automation of the activities in the process reduces waste, time, cost, and redundant processes as factors of sustainability, which may also help to lessen the unfavorable effects of the pandemic.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"Increased attention to environmental sustainability has created pressures to adopt the circular economy (CE) principles. The transition toward CE requires system redesign and business process modification. Embracing disruptive technologies produces several benefits including improved productivity and resource utilization. Thus, organizations become eager to adopt and sustain digital supply chains (DSCs) in globally competitive markets. Additionally, the linkage between DSC with CE and the impact of DSC on organizational performances from the perspective of CE remain unexplored in previous studies. This study aims to develop a framework for DSC adoption from the perspective of CE. The present study recognizes the barriers through literature review and experts' opinions that must be eradicated to attain the objectives of DSCs. In this study, 19 potential barriers to DSCs were identified. A fuzzy best–worst method (BWM) was adopted to prioritize the identified barriers. Further, the study formulates strategies for integrating the CE with DSCs to overcome the barriers. A modified Total Interpretive Structure Model (m-TISM) was developed to highlight the different levels of suggested strategies. This study contributes to the existing literature by analyzing the identified barriers to DSCs and suggesting overcoming strategies. The integrated methodology assists organizations to develop efficient and integrated strategic measures toward DSC adoption through the application of enhanced knowledge of CE and environmental sustainability. The findings reveal that the “lack of digital skills and facilities” is the most influential barrier in DSC development.

Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Increasing pressure from customer expectations to government regulation for sustainable food products warrants research in the sustainable food supply chain (FSC). One-third of the food produced is wasted, despite the potential to valorize food wastes. Additionally, the uncertainty associated with the supply of food products has a significant impact on the FSC decisions, steering the need for robust and sustainable models.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Increasing sustainability demands of stakeholders and government regulators are driving Food Manufacturing Companies (FMCs) towards embedding sustainability practices across the entire food value chain. This is most relevant in emerging economies such as India, as the sustainable growth of the food supply chain (SC) is predominantly dependent upon its multiple tiers of suppliers. Regrettably, the most impactful tier of suppliers, which are the grass-root suppliers, lie outside the reach of the sustainable efforts of the FMC. Significantly, the incorporation of the sustainability initiatives needs consistent and coordinated efforts of all the tiers of suppliers and stakeholders, especially in the current situation where a global pandemic badly hits farmers. This can be achieved by adopting Collaborative Sustainable Practices (CSPs) for channelization of joint efforts of FMC and stakeholders towards sustainability of grass-root suppliers using supply chain practice view. However, minimal documentation exists regarding the same, and the present study intends to fill this gap. Based on a case study of an Indian flour milling company, the focus of the research work is (1) identifying CSPs that FMC can adopt, (2) ascertaining the role of interim suppliers for ensuring sustainability up to the last tier of suppliers, and (3) developing a structural model utilizing combined efficiencies of Total Interpretive Structural Modeling technique and Fuzzy-MICMAC analysis, which the FMC can adopt for effectively implementing both the traditional practices as well as the CSPs. Through the result findings, decision-makers can visualize the impact and strength of each CSP and its interactions with other CSPs. It can enable them to cascade effective managerial responses into the respective tiers of SC for successful implementation of the CSPs and transmission of sustainability benefits to include the grass root suppliers.

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Increasing the use of marine transportation has many benefits, ranging from the diversion of human traffic into different modes to the reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of reduced road traffic congestion. Since road traffic congestion has become a major issue for many cities, utilization of marine transportation is a point of interest for authorities. The supply chain of spare parts, batteries, etc., must also be carefully considered since the availability of materials is an important matter for such transitions. In this study, four alternatives, which are selected considering a sustainable transition to a more developed marine transportation system, are presented, namely optimizing the performance of ferry operations, converting current ferries into hybrid ferries, converting current ferries into electric ferries, and purchasing a new electric ferry fleet. Experts are consulted to receive their assessments of these alternatives according to various criteria, including sustainability measures and supply chain, defined under 4 main criteria topics, which are technical aspect, operational aspect, environmental aspect, and cost aspect. We aim to propose a novel weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) approach based on the fuzzy Hamacher weighted averaging (FHWAA) function and weighted geometric averaging (FHWGA) function for advantage prioritization of the sustainable supply chain of the electric ferry. A case study is used to illustrate the formulation and solution of the problem. According to the expert views, it is seen that purchasing a new electric fleet is the most advantageous alternative.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Increasingly, policymakers are setting ambitious goals for sustainability in public procurement, integrated across different pillars. Such ambitions are apparent in public catering services, where procurement models have been shifting towards greater localisation of supply chains and purchasing of more organically grown food. To date however, few studies have examined empirically what the impacts of different procurement models are across these multiple pillars of sustainability. This research aimed to fill the gap, by measuring and comparing the environmental, economic and nutritional outcomes of different models of school meals procurement. Case studies were undertaken of ten primary school meals services in five European countries, capturing different procurement model types. Results showed carbon emissions ranged from 0.95 kgs CO2e per meal in the lowest case to 2.41 kgs CO2e in the highest case, with adoption of low carbon food waste disposal methods and reduction of the amount of ruminant meat in the menus being the most important actions for lowering emissions. In terms of economic impact, local economic multiplier ratios ranged from 1.59 to 2.46, and although the level of local food sourcing contributed to these ratios, the effect was eclipsed, in some cases, by investment in local catering staff.

Energy Policy,"India is committed to increase its use of renewable energy to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The country has an overarching goal of installing 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. Bioenergy can play an important role in the energy mix by balancing the seasonal and hourly power demands that may be unmet by intermittent renewables. Ensuring the sustainable production and consumption of bioenergy are key to meeting India's bioenergy targets. Here, using GCAM, future bioenergy pathways in India are modeled to understand four important dimensions of sustainability: water availability, greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and land use change. It is found that a higher demand for bioenergy crops cause an increase in water demand and creates a competition for land that forces crop production to move to basins with higher growing capacity, causing concerns for food security in the future. However, with investments to improve water use efficiency in the agricultural sector, capacity goals can be reached by 2030 with minimal food-energy-water impacts. Finally, with the development of ample supply chains to incentivize the harvesting, processing, and transportation of agricultural residues for bioenergy, many of the potentially negative impacts from bioenergy crop expansion can be alleviated.","Graham N.T., Gakkhar N., Singh A.D., Evans M., Stelmach T., Durga S., Godara R., Gajera B., Wise M., Sarma A.K.",Integrated analysis of increased bioenergy futures in India,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132930328&doi=10.1016%2fj.enpol.2022.113125&partnerID=40&md5=587de4a584b8f1c34cd491673bd8f46c

The objective of this paper is to elaborate on the transition process, which incorporates the destabilization of fossil fuel and the growth of geothermal energy, by analyzing the impact of both exogenous and endogenous factors on the supply chain structures of both sectors. This study employs workshop involving geothermal stakeholders in Indonesia, combined with the application of the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework as the theoretical lens. The study found that energy demand, environmental awareness, energy regulations, energy supply chain, and geothermal potential breakthroughs are important aspects pertinent to the MLP components, namely the socio-technical landscape, socio-technical regime and niche innovations. The socio-technical landscapes are exogenous factors that pressurize the energy sector regime allowing the niche innovation, in the form of geothermal innovation, to penetrate the fossil fuel regime, allowing it to transition to a geothermal regime.

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Industrialization has caused dire consumption of resources and has already caused acute damage to the environment. Due to stringent environmental regulations, organizations are enforced to adopt sustainability strategies such as reuse, repair, reduce, and remanufacturing. To remanufacture products, manufacturing organizations have to transform their supply chains to be closed or circular. In this study, a mathematical model is formulated to transform a traditional linear supply chain into a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) for an organization located in India. It is accomplished by incorporating remanufacturing with reverse logistics into the supply chain to achieve sustainability thereby satisfying the sustainable development goals (SDGs). A multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming approach was used to formulate the model to optimize the supply chain to improve the operations of manufacturing, recycling, repair, and disposal to minimize the environmental effects and to maximize the net profit of the product. The GAMS optimization software was used to solve the model, and sensitivity analysis was carried out to validate the robustness of the proposed network. The result states that the organization can make profits by adopting the SDGs. Industry can optimize the number of parts to be repaired, dismantled, recycled, and determine the supplier's optimum quantity of parts purchase. Lack of awareness on the potential of sustainable CLSCs is hindering its acceptance in the economy. The proper use of the proposed model not only helps the organization to maximize profit but also minimizes the environmental impact by attaining sustainability. This study is helpful for organizations that are eco-conscious and are willing to balance economic profit and environmental well-being by adopting sustainability in CLSCs.","Rajak S., Vimal K.E.K., Arumugam S., Parthiban J., Sivaraman S.K., Kandasamy J., Duque A.A.",Multi-objective mixed-integer linear optimization model for sustainable closed-loop supply chain network: a case study on remanufacturing steering column,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112627901&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-021-01713-5&partnerID=40&md5=7bace2b73343a84d6f2e7f4b4210f826

The interrelations of challenges are specified by Interpretive Structural Modeling, and the final ranking of challenges is determined through the Fuzzy Analytical Network Process. After validating the completed questionnaires, the absence of experts in I4.0, lack of clear comprehension of I4.0 concepts, training programs, and governmental policies and support are determined as the most critical challenges. Finally, the results and discussion, which can help practitioners in the efficient adoption of I4.0 to have a sustainable reverse logistics system, are presented.","Pourmehdi M., Paydar M.M., Ghadimi P., Azadnia A.H.",Analysis and evaluation of challenges in the integration of Industry 4.0 and sustainable steel reverse logistics network,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119903742&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2021.107808&partnerID=40&md5=c5c7309c35bc1cf8f6a03beed78dbc95
Annals of Operations Research,"Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is of burgeoning interest for both researchers and practitioners in the operations management and supply chain context. In recent times, research has examined the antecedents and consequents of I4.0; however, inconsistencies in empirical findings have precluded a clear understanding of the drivers of I4.0 adoption and the subsequent impacts on firm performance. To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis of the key antecedents and consequents of I4.0. By establishing these pathways and processes using meta-analysis, we seek to reconcile conflicting results in prior literature and develop a unified framework of the antecedents and consequents of I4.0 adoption. Based on the empirical findings reported in 22 prior studies, we identified 12 antecedents representing technological, organizational, and environmental factors and four consequents representing firm performance of I4.0 adoption. Our findings facilitate managers to prioritize their resources to accentuate I4.0 adoption.","Raj A., Jeyaraj A.","Antecedents and consequents of industry 4.0 adoption using technology, organization and environment (TOE) framework: A meta-analysis",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138163515&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-022-04942-7&partnerID=40&md5=f0336033ea47053395992a650b565453
Operations Management Research,"Industry 4.0 and the emergence of the circular economy have inspired industries to rigorously concentrate on digital technologies (DTs). There is an excellent appetite for DTs in developing countries like India, and initiatives such as Digital India have transformed business to a more sustainable dimension. Encouraged to adopt DTs, industries identify practical barriers at the social, environmental and economic levels. Although the literature provides discussion on these barriers, a rational prioritization is lacking. To circumvent the problem, a fuzzy decision model is put forward. Firstly, the barriers affecting DT adoption are reviewed and industry experts can rate the barriers after that. Owing to the diversification/heterogeneity of the experts, biased weights are determined by the fuzzy-attitudinal-CRiteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation (CRITIC) technique. Furthermore, the barriers are prioritized by proposing the interactive COomplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) algorithm. Finally, a case example from the food industry is exemplified so as to understand the usefulness of the model, and a comparison with the other models is made so as to realize the benefits and the shortcomings.","Krishankumar R., Amritha P.P., Ravichandran K.S.",An integrated fuzzy decision model for prioritization of barriers affecting sustainability adoption within supply chains under unknown weight context,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139234024&doi=10.1007%2fs12063-022-00322-3&partnerID=40&md5=7746c49eb2c88309f510988aa0b99de3
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Industry 4.0 has already become part of the world's largest manufacturers and is beginning to influencing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through the supply chain. High-tech industries, such as pharmaceuticals, electronic equipment, aircraft manufacturing, etc., will be the first to face technological transformation. To this end, it becomes relevant to assess the sustainability of the technological development of SMEs as a factor of their successful digital transformation. This paper fills a gap in the study of such development as it pertains to Russian high-tech SMEs. Based on a critical literature review, we propose a new approach to assessing the sustainable technological development of these industries. The approach is distinguished by the use of a set of five indicators highlighted during the literature review, which can be quantified based on financial statements. The choice of variables is justified by their compliance with the specifics of industrial SMEs and KMO and Bartlett tests. We empirically tested the selected indicators using a sample of 7980 enterprises in two high-tech industries: Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE). We concluded that the larger the business, the higher the sustainability of its technological development. At the same time, SMEs have two key advantages in the implementation of technological development – a decrease in resource costs of production, flexibility in asset management and gross profit. The proposed approach allows us to identify promising high-tech SMEs for the transition to Industry 4.0 technologies. Our research will be useful both for private enterprises when searching for technologically promising contractors and for public authorities when analyzing and selecting enterprises for pilot digital transformation.","Pylaeva I.S., Podshivalova M.V., Alola A.A., Podshivalov D.V., Demin A.A.",A new approach to identifying high-tech manufacturing SMEs with sustainable technological development: Empirical evidence,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131433912&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.132322&partnerID=40&md5=c5ff963f019aa263313da09779c7fe68
Operations Management Research,"Industry 4.0 has the potential of growing industrialization and, on the other hand, disrupting the sustainability of prevailing manufacturing supply chains through inducing great challenges such as higher resource consumption that, in turn, results in global warming and climate change. As a result, researchers working in the area of sustainable supply chain 4.0 need to make deep evaluations on the challenges arising for manufacturing supply chains contemplating the improvement of their sustainability levels and having a digital transformation toward Industry 4.0. To fill this gap, the current paper designs an innovative framework on the basis of the Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) technique and the Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) approach to evaluate the challenges that may arise for supply chain 4.0 in the q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets (q-ROFSs) setting. The proposed method uses an extended SWARA process to determine the criteria importance degrees considering the experts’ preferences. The performance of the proposed method was assessed by conducting an empirical case study under the q-ROFSs condition. Further, a sensitivity analysis was executed to check whether the proposed method is stable enough to be relied on parameter values. Finally, the results obtained were compared to those of currently used methods to verify the obtained results’ reliability.

"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","Industry 4.0 is a predominantly used terminology to denote the current fourth Industrial Revolution in progress. The use of new technology such as IoT, cloud computing, robotic additive manufacturing and artificial intelligence, and how industry and other working areas are performed facilitates this high-tech metamorphosis. Simultaneously accelerating the changes exponentially, the current technological changeover egresses sustainability as one of the major issues in the domestic and international markets. Sustainability strategies should consider the ambivalence level and the future risks that organizational decisions may impose on the natural and social environments and the obligatory investment costs to make the supply chains more sustainable. The system's performance may be affected by the ripple effect caused by supplier base disruption propagating en route for the supply chain. Although the vulnerability assessments in single-echelon-single-event disruptions are critical for many firms, nevertheless the ripple effect modelling for multi-echelon-correlated events is becoming important. In this paper, two models have been discussed Markov Chain in conjunction with Bayesian Network to quantify the ripple effect.","Mukherjee P., Patra S.S., Samantaray S., Barik L., Barik R.K.",SCSF: Supply Chain Sustainability Framework by Bayesian Theory and Markov Model for Risk Analysis,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129273135&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-6616-2_28&partnerID=40&md5=72a39be4866f91383838dc0bdf44e88b
IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,"Industry 4.0 is significantly transforming the traditional way of managing supply chains. However, Industry 4.0 tools can be expensive and not affordable and can be implemented in a variety of ways. Therefore, the benefits of implementing these tools should be clarified before investing in digitizing the Procurement process. The objective of the work is to present the dimensions (Competencies, Management, Partnerships, Processes, Systems/Technologies, and Sustainability) and the tools of Ind4.0 motivating the trends of evolution in the procurement area in the face of these changes in technologies and digital transformation. Despite the importance of this issue, few studies have attempted to address the effects of Ind4.0, technologies, and intelligent systems in procurement. To fill this gap, in the applications of Ind4.0 tools a conceptual model was developed to classify different value propositions provided by the different applications of Ind4.0 tools in the internal and external processes of the area. Finally, the results conclude that the six dimensions proposed in the conceptual model can provide a better understanding of the Procurement area, demonstrating the trends of the implementation of Ind4.0 tools related to different activities, presented by the literature authors.","Bueno R.E., Almeida dos Santos H., de Junior Freitas M., Toloi R.C., Gonçalves R.F.",Procurement 4.0: A Systematic Review of Its Technological Evolution,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138781168&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-16411-8_19&partnerID=40&md5=494b92b09708b6b30019e406755f1903

Sustainable Operations and Computers,"Industry 4.0 technologies provide critical perspectives for future innovation and business growth. Technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, Machine Learning (ML), and other advanced upcoming technologies are being used to implement Industry 4.0.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Industry 4.0 technologies, sustainability, and coordination are gaining more importance in today's competitive business environment. Motivated by these trends, our research problem is to analyze the effects of Industry 4.0 technologies and coordination on the sustainability of supply chains. We consider two supply chains with three stages. The first one uses classic methods to manufacture and distribute the products, whereas the second one uses Industry 4.0 technologies. Whether the supply chain invests in Industry 4.0 technologies or not and the investment level affect its economic, environmental, and social sustainability. We develop Nash bargaining based revenue-sharing contracts for coordinating the supply chains. The results indicate that even though a more coordinated classic supply chain can dominate the decentralized Industry 4.0 chain in terms of market demand and profitability, coordination is not enough for the classic supply chain to be considered sustainable. Moreover, although a decentralized Industry 4.0 supply chain has efforts in all three sustainability dimensions, its overall sustainability is not guaranteed based on the thresholds determined by the decision maker. On the other hand, when a supply chain uses the advantages of Industry 4.0 technologies in conjunction with coordination, this chain leads the market in terms of overall sustainability. This result shows the joint importance of Industry 4.0 technologies and coordination on the sustainability of a supply chain. Furthermore, as consumers become more sensitive to buy sustainable products, the supply chains are encouraged to invest in sustainability initiatives and Industry 4.0 technologies more, leading to a more sustainable world.",Toktaş-Palut P.,Analyzing the effects of Industry 4.0 technologies and coordination on the sustainability of supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121641728&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2021.12.005&partnerID=40&md5=46aad0c654e23c298e33e3de2a2575e5

Global Health Science and Practice,"Information Mobilized for Performance Analysis and Continuous Transformation (IMPACT) Teams routinely bring together data, people, processes, and technology, under the leadership of governments, to institute a change in culture that leads to sustained improvements in supply chain processes and outcomes. This mixed methods study examined whether IMPACT Teams were effective in improving reproductive health supply chain outcomes in Guinea, Indonesia, Kenya, and Myanmar and identified enablers and barriers to IMPACT Team success and sustainability in Indonesia and Kenya. The study design employed a pre-post intervention comparison panel design with a nonrandomized matched comparison group to examine the IMPACT Teams' effect on 2 supply chain outcomes: stocked according to plan and stock-outs. Additional key informant interviews conducted in Kenya and Indonesia explored enablers and barriers to IMPACT Team success and sustainability. For nearly all products across the 4 countries, an increase in products being stocked according to plan and a reduction in stock-outs can be attributed to the IMPACT Team intervention, demonstrating that IMPACT teams are an effective approach for improving contraceptive supply chain inventory management and availability. However, our findings do not demonstrate a clear causal pathway as theorized in our theory of change, namely that government leadership leads to the installation of a data use culture, which in turn leads to improved product availability. In both Indonesia and Kenya, though product availability improved, there was a lack of leadership and culture change. This suggests that improved product availability does not depend on establishing a data use culture or government leadership, but rather, that a data use culture-rather than product availability-is the outcome of interest for sustained change, and that understanding motivations and incentives for leadership participation may be more important for scaling, institutionalizing, and sustaining gains in supply chain outcomes.","Yongho A.-M., Chandani Y., Andersson S., Karim A., Saad B., Keddem C.","Data to Action: A Mixed-Methods Study of Data Use Teams, Improved Availability of Contraceptives in Guinea, Indonesia, Kenya, and Myanmar [Des données pour action: une étude par méthodes mixtes portant sur les équipes d'utilisation des données, l'amélioration de la disponibilité des contraceptifs et le rôle de la gouvernance en Guinée, en Indonésie, au Kenya et au Myanmar]",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134785276&doi=10.9745%2fGHSP-D-21-00345&partnerID=40&md5=c29458b46b4f46b6f97971ec0b98a783
Current Research in Environmental Sustainability,"Information sharing lies at the core of most governance interventions within agro-food commodity supply-chains, such as certification standards or direct trade relationships. However, actors have little information available to guide sustainable consumption decisions beyond simple labels. Blockchain technology can potentially alleviate the numerous sustainability problems related to agro-food commodity supply-chains by fostering traceability and transparency. Despite significant research on blockchain, there is limited understanding of the concrete barriers and benefits and potential applications of blockchain in real-world settings. Here, we present a case study of blockchain implementation in a coffee supply-chain. Our aim is to assess the potential of blockchain technology to promote sustainability in coffee supply chains through increased traceability and transparency and to identify barriers and opportunities for this. While our pilot implementation clearly illustrates certain benefits of blockchain, it also suggests that blockchain is no silver bullet for delivering agro-food supply chain sustainability. Knowledge on provenance and transparency of information on quality and sustainability can help trigger transformation of consumer behaviour, but the actual value lies in digitising the supply chain to increase efficiency and reduce costs, disputes, and fraud, while providing more insight end-to-end through product provenance and chain-of-custody information.

No reviews focused on food supply‐chain activities. Most reviews were rated as critically low (n = 28, 47%) or low (n = 21, 35%) quality using AMSTAR 2. Evidence supports the effectiveness of multi‐component breastfeeding interventions, interventions delivered in home and child‐care settings, particularly when involving parents, interactive skill building and repeated exposure to vegetables. Food vouchers and access to local farmers mar-kets and community gardens have potential for improving access and availability to healthier foods, while evidence supports interventions improving the external food environment, including fiscal strategies such as the SSB tax, restrictions on marketing and advertising of discretionary products and improved food labelling.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Infrastructure plays a vital role in improving people's standard of living and contributing to economic growth. Compared with other construction types, infrastructure has longer operational periods, more complex supply chains and more significant impacts on communities. As a result, the concept of sustainable infrastructure has been put forward, and scholars have been developing assessment frameworks to ensure balanced economic, environmental and social outcomes of infrastructure projects. By reviewing the existing assessment frameworks for infrastructure projects, it has been found that there is a lack of criteria for measuring the intangible impacts of infrastructure projects on local communities, such as public mental health and intangible heritage management. The measurement of social sustainability is also insufficient in most assessment frameworks. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by developing an innovative assessment framework to incorporate the components and subcomponents highlighted in the literature and those that are usually overlooked but significant in measuring the intangible influences and social sustainability of infrastructures. The research adopted mixed methods, including a questionnaire survey, focus group interview and confirmatory factor analysis, to evaluate the reliability and validity of the proposed framework.

Applied Sciences (Switzerland),"Innovations are essential for global development and market dynamics. Innovation management is central to organizations for gaining adaptability and dynamic capabilities to ensure their sustainability over time. Right decisions are essential for the implementation of innovations. How-ever, on many occasions, especially in the product development process, decisions are taken based on static analysis, qualitative criteria, questionnaires, and/or quantitative evaluations that are outdated. Moreover, many innovation developments do not consider the existing databases in their information systems of similar innovation projects, especially in the early phases of new innovations when evaluations are mainly driven by area, group, or person. Furthermore, inventions are introduced in different regions, plants, and socio-economic situations, providing different results. In this context, considering that innovations shape our current and future world, including all products and services, as well as how humans, organizations, and machines interact, the significance of the paper is clear. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an innovation management model based on the Viable System Model to cope with any potential future environment based on internal organizational capabilities. For this purpose, the paper designs a Digital Ecosystem for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (DE4.0) based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act methodology applicable to any information system consisting of a digital twin, a simulation model, databases from existing information systems, and quality management techniques. This DE4.0 provides a huge advantage for the applicability and scalability of innovations as it allows one to plan, monitor, assess, and improve. Moreover, based on the conceptual model, a generic project evaluation scheme is developed, providing a platform for innovation project management and control during the whole innovation life cycle. As a result, the research provides a scientific and practical contribution for an integrated management of innovations based on the best information and set of techniques available. Based on this framework, a supply-chain case study is developed. The results show how, depending on the intended goals, the past experiences, the evolution of the innovation, and the innovation scope, indicators can be influenced towards reaching the initial goals and reducing the innovation risks. Finally, a discussion about the potential use and role of the DE4.0 for innovation projects and the related learning process is performed.","Gallego-García S., Ren D., Gallego-García D., Pérez-García S., García-García M.",Dynamic Innovation Information System (DIIS) for a New Management Age,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133565633&doi=10.3390%2fapp12136592&partnerID=40&md5=5f293d7de5ffa98f7f8d52370fb54546
Energy Conversion and Management: X,"Integrating sustainability into the distribution network process is a significant problem for any industry hoping to prosper or survive in today's fast-paced environment. Since gas is one of the world's most important fuel sources, sustainability is more important for the gas industry. While such environmental and economic effects have been extensively researched in the literature, there is little emphasis on the full social sustainability of natural gas production and supply chains in terms of the triple bottom line. This research aims to perform the first hybrid life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) of liquefied natural gas and evaluate its performance from the natural gas extraction stage to LNG regasification after delivery through maritime transport carriers. LCSA is used for estimating the social, economic, and environmental impacts of processes, and our life cycle model included the multi-region input–output analysis, Aspen HYSYS, and LNG maritime transport operations sustainability assessment tools. The results spot the light on the most contributors of CO2-eq emission. It is found that LNG loading (export terminal) is the source that generated the highest carbon footprint, followed by the MDEA sweetening unit with the contribution of 40% and 24%, respectively. Socially, around 73% of human health impact comes from SRU and TGTU units which are the most contributors to the particulate matter emission. Based on the interpretation of life cycle results, the environmental indicators show better performance in the pre-separation unit and LNG receiving terminal representing a sustainability factor equal to 1. In terms of social and economic impacts, the natural gas extraction stage presents the best performance among all other stages, with a sustainability factor equal to 1.

Decision Sciences,"Intense media scrutiny and public backlash stimulate consumers to be conscientious about sustainability issues from the supply chain (SC) perspective. Accordingly, our focus in this article is on joint sustainability issues in a manufacturer–supplier relationship under a contract that possibly shares sustainability-related costs, when there exists a supplier's potentially deficient sustainability effort. We find that the manufacturer may prefer indirect (i.e., paying a higher component price to its supplier) rather than direct support (i.e., increasing subsidies for a supplier's sustainability expenditures) when consumers are sensitive to the supplier's sustainability. We further find that as consumers' sensitivity to the supplier's sustainability increases, an uncoordinated SC will gradually approach the coordinated SC. This occurs because the increased sensitivity encourages greater cooperation among SC members. Our findings will help establish a better understanding of the joint sustainability development issues in an SC.","Yoon J., Song J.M., Choi J.-H., Talluri S.",Joint Sustainability Development in a Supply Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096693513&doi=10.1111%2fdeci.12501&partnerID=40&md5=b869ebc7ab3c8a9fd6d552488e3e6019

The value-add is more enhanced with COP26 determination to curb methane minimum minus thirty percent. The change obviously embeds benefits, through intent on societal empowerment, initiative on water waste energy rehaul, immersion with gender aligned supply chains. This paper is on the construct of mixed method based qualitative methodology on value-add change that embeds benefits in the renewable energy embedded sustainable supply chains with methane harness. Embedded energy in supply chains can now focus on innovation retaed to methane and not alone carbon dioxide. Developing regions are vibrant with economic activity that proliferate supply chains. They innately depend on water waste energy footprint. There is resonating need for positioning sustainable supply chains with renewable energy that is gender aligned. Methane is a ultra-potent greenhouse gas that has a win win focus on adoption of renewable energy as well as attain sustainability of energy needs of supply chains. Methane traps one hundred times more heat when present in the atmosphere. Focus on methane is potent as it gets removed within a decade, in contrast to carbon dioxide that lingers over centuries. The linkgage options through innovation, intent, impact is a contribution of this paper. Supply chain resource corridors are tenable to potential renewable inclusion. The possibility of varying the impacts of different values of the independent variables, future research can confirm the extent of renewable energy adoption with sustainable supply chain growth. One could also design for variance on the changes of location or habitats, that can define the need of a distributed and differentiated range of combinations.

Expert Opinion on Drug Delivery,"Introduction: Sustainability within the pharmaceutical industry is becoming a focal point for many companies, to improve the longevity and social perception of the industry. Both additive manufacturing (AM) and microfluidics (MFs) are continuously progressing, so are far from their optimization in terms of sustainability; hence, it is the aim of this review to highlight potential gaps alongside their beneficial features. Discussed throughout this review also will be an in-depth discussion on the environmental, legal, economic, and social particulars relating to these emerging technologies. Areas covered: Additive manufacturing (AM) and microfluidics (MFs) are discussed in depth within this review, drawing from up-to-date literature relating to sustainability and circular economies. This applies to both technologies being utilized for therapeutic and analytical purposes within the pharmaceutical industry. Expert opinion: It is the role of emerging technologies to be at the forefront of promoting a sustainable message by delivering plausible environmental standards whilst maintaining efficacy and economic viability. AM processes are highly customizable, allowing for their optimization in terms of sustainability, from reducing printing time to reducing material usage by removing supports. MFs too are supporting sustainability via reduced material wastage and providing a sustainable means for point of care analysis.","Weaver E., O’Hagan C., Lamprou D.A.",The sustainability of emerging technologies for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132979546&doi=10.1080%2f17425247.2022.2093857&partnerID=40&md5=6862d2d3a7a88e0f7fb2ce2562b7115b

The level of accident rates in the construction industry place OHS issues at the heart of their strategic management. Method: The assessment of OHS issues was made by drawing appropriate data from the Corporate Social Responsibility reports of 19 multinational construction companies published on a voluntary basis. Results: The findings show a low response rate by the companies sampled to the requirements of stakeholders for responsible organizational behavior and accountability for their consequences. Most of the companies sampled have only focused on a small number of OHS issues to assure the transparency of the information published such as OHS governance, accident and illness rates, training hours, third party assurance, and membership of externally developed OHS charters. Similarly, other important OHS issues seem to be less covered by the companies sampled such as the representation of total workforce in OHS committees, the percentage of high risk occupations, and OHS practices in the supply chain.","Mavroulidis M., Vouros P., Fotiadis S., Konstantakopoulou F., Fountoulakis G., Nikolaou I., Evangelinos K.",Occupational health and safety of multinational construction companies through evaluation of corporate social responsibility reports,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125372452&doi=10.1016%2fj.jsr.2022.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=d3f89e1693e9711fec6698758c0c75cd

Forests,"Investments toward a carbon-neutral forest industry will change forestry and wood procurement in Northern Finland. The changing market situation requires data-driven DSSs for the strategic management of logistics. Using this software, logistics were described by a continuing wood flow model and optimized by a dynamic method. Three logistics scenarios described wood flows in the present and in the future. The optimization minimized the economic and environmental costs, which decreased by 4.9%. However, synchronized multimodal transportation costs increased by 23.3%. Therefore, maximum logistics efficiency necessitates increases in railway transport capac-ity. The change would also decrease CO2 emission costs. Under scenario-specific circumstances, logistics operations could be focused on four profitable regions, increasing market shares at munici-palities. To guarantee environmental sustainability of these municipalities, optimization of timber markets between forest owners and forest industry must be developed further by driving data from the EU’s emission allowance price compensation mechanism to the optimization process.

Reviews in Aquaculture,"Iran has subsidised trout egg imports due to the lower feed conversion ratio of most imported trout eggs. However, the rainbow trout industry is divided on whether to allocate or abolish imported trout subsidies. The elimination of such support would lead to a three-fold rise in the price of imported trout eggs (which are already more expensive than domestic trout eggs). Furthermore, the economic performance of the domestic trout supply chain over the imported trout supply chain remains yet to be clarified. The present study seeks to evaluate whether imported trout egg subsidies should be continued. Economic efficiency and network data envelopment analysis are used to evaluate the performance and role of subsidies in trout supply chains in Mazandaran, one of the largest trout farming provinces as a new case study in the aquaculture sector, in 2018. Farms that used imported trout eggs were found to have lower economic efficiency and higher dependence on import subsidies. Feed costs were identified to be the most important explanation for poor economic efficiency of trout production. Finally, the results reveal that the development of domestic trout propagation supply chains with integrated forward vertical structures could improve efficiency in the system. The re-distribution of imported trout egg subsidies to fund feed cost reduction technologies could provide effective solutions to enhance economic efficiency, production sustainability and food security.","Asadikia H., Mosavi S.H., Reed M.R., Bjorndal T., Najafi Alamdarlo H., Khalilian S.",Two-level trout supply chain's economic efficiency analysis in Iran: Trout egg import subsidies role,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139704077&doi=10.1111%2fraq.12746&partnerID=40&md5=f71a9258b8df949c6a0d7dba266ef609

"Resources, Conservation and Recycling Advances","It is important to implement sustainability throughout the supply chain and manufacturing process in order to achieve sustainability in a manufacturing system. As part of that effort, selecting an appropriate supplier while taking sustainability into account is a critical requirement in today's manufacturing industry, particularly in emerging economies like Bangladesh. This requirement is even more critical for any industry that utilizes a variety of chemicals in its manufacturing process. This research attempted to develop a multi criteria decision making (MCDM) framework for sustainable supplier selection in the textile dyeing industry, one of Bangladesh's largest chemical-consuming industries. An extensive literature review and expert feedback have identified 15 critical economic, environmental, and social evaluation criteria for sustainable supplier selection. The weights of the identified evaluation criteria were determined using the Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method. Following that, the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method was used to determine the final ranking of suppliers in the textile dyeing sector using the SWARA method's criteria weights. According to SWARA's findings, the most important criterion is ""chemical quality,"" followed by ""price of chemical,"" ""meeting delivery time,"" ""employee health and safety,"" and ""environmental management system."" The WASPAS method indicates that supplier A, a global chemical supplier based in Singapore, is the most sustainable of all the competing suppliers. Later in this study, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for WASPAS method for various values of (λ) and later comparing its results with various popular MCDM methods. Sensitivity analysis ensures that the results obtained from WASPAS is in fact valid. This study is expected to assist decision-makers in the textile dyeing industries of emerging economies to efficiently select suppliers who are not only economically viable but also environmentally sustainable in the long run.","Rahman M.M., Bari A.B.M.M., Ali S.M., Taghipour A.",Sustainable supplier selection in the textile dyeing industry: An integrated multi-criteria decision analytics approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139034802&doi=10.1016%2fj.rcradv.2022.200117&partnerID=40&md5=d84d121ef4a7de5e12492c8d920165a1
Environmental Impact Assessment Review,"It is necessary to assess a product's sustainability from both environmental and social perspectives. However, combined environmental and social performance assessments have not been given enough attention. This paper presents a combined Environmental Life Cycle Assessment (E-LCA) and Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) of an industrial LED luminaire through its life cycle. The LCA screening studies were conducted in line with ISO 14044 and United Nations Guidelines for E-LCA and S-LCA with Ecoinvent and PSILCA databases. The study analysed the key potential risks as well as the interrelation between E-LCA and S-LCA results, in which the production of LED driver, LED panel, and electricity consumption were identified as the hotspot processes to both environmental and social impacts. Four social issues were identified, namely ‘association and bargaining rights’, ‘sanitation coverage’, ‘public sector corruption’ and ‘pollution’. LED driver and panels are responsible for 78% and 20% of the environmental impacts respectively in the production phase. Electricity accounts for an average of 51% of environmental impacts. The process also made the key contribution to the ‘social responsibility along the supply chain’ (52%), ‘industrial water depletion’ (84%) and ‘contribution to environmental load’ (63%) risks. Meanwhile, in the category ‘contribution to economic development’, 18% positive social impacts were identified. Based on the results obtained, recommendations were derived for the development of sustainable LED lighting products and services with a trade-off between the environmental impact and the socio-economic benefits. According to the literature review, this research is the first attempt to assess a combined environmental and social performance in industrial LED lighting products and provides a valuable contribution to knowledge for future research in this area.","Wang S., Su D., Wu Y.",Environmental and social life cycle assessments of an industrial LED lighting product,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130133990&doi=10.1016%2fj.eiar.2022.106804&partnerID=40&md5=879d5e30df176a620f6391c3ce6e83ab
Science of the Total Environment,"It is recognised today that the global food system does not always deliver good nutrition for all human beings, and, additionally, dramatically contributes to climate change, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss. In particular, the cereal sector threatens biodiversity and ecosystem functions, due to environmentally harmful farming activities, that critically alter climate conditions, along with energy, land, and water resources. According to this paper's authors' opinion, this supports the rationale of conducting a systematic literature review of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) in the durum wheat (DW) sector, to highlight environmental hotspots and improvement potentials in the phases of cultivation and processing into finished products like pasta and bread. Methodological aspects were also discussed in this paper, to provide useful insights on how to best perform LCA in such agri-food supply chains. Given the findings from the papers reviewed, the authors could document that the cultivation phase is the primary environmental hotspot of DW-derived food products and suggested several mitigation and improvements solution including, organic farming practices, diversified cropping systems, reduction of N fertilisers and pesticides application, and irrigation optimisation strategies. Furthermore, the review highlighted that there exist two main gaps in the literature, mainly related to the scarce attention on the organic farming sector and DW landraces, and the lack of nutritional-property accounting in LCAs. Finally, although specific, the review may be of interest to researchers, LCA practitioners, farmers and producers, policy- and decision-makers, and other stakeholders, and could support the promotion of environmental sustainability in the DW sector.","Zingale S., Guarnaccia P., Matarazzo A., Lagioia G., Ingrao C.",A systematic literature review of life cycle assessments in the durum wheat sector,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133710052&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.157230&partnerID=40&md5=68cafede68203e64ccad9db675fb15b6
IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,"It is widely observed in industry that some firms intentionally &#x201C;greenwash&#x201D; their products to profit from the ever-rising green consumerism; however, there are also some firms that unintentionally greenwash as a result of misinformation, a form of supplier responsibility risk. To manage this risk, the most common approach is asking for samples before the products are delivered at scale. In this article, we consider a contract manufacturer (CM) that supplies products to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The CM has the option to implement a green product line. Before conveying a sustainability message to consumers, we assume that the OEM can choose whether or not to ask for samples and update its belief about the final product type. We start with a base case where the CM does not sell self-branded products. In this situation, the CM always sends an authentic signal and the OEM conducts deliberate greenwash only when the risk of detection is low. However, after extending the base case to a co-opetition case, where the CM not only makes profit from its contract manufacturing business, but also sells self-branded products, the strategic interactions of the OEM and CM become more intriguing. We find the OEM may deliberately greenwash even if it is highly risky, in order to lower the wholesale price, and the CM may send nongreen samples even if a green product line is setup. More interestingly, we find the misleading signal is able to mitigate the double marginalization effect (the double markup in price) by decreasing the wholesale price and the market price of products simultaneously, and this increases consumer surplus, but may lead to higher environmental impact. This work has implications for both operations managers and regulators. We suggest managers in OEMs ask for samples before a CM delivers products at scale if the market potential is high and the CM encroaches on end market. Regulators should note that penalties alone may not curb greenwash, as an OEM may use it for strategic purpose.

GeoJournal,"Jordan is a food-deficit country. Jordan’s population reached approximately 10 million in 2019 and has an annual growth rate of 3.3%. This increase will exert heavy pressure on the kingdom’s fragile natural resource base. The total imports of food commodities still exceed exports, so Jordan is a deficit country with respect to its food supply chain. Data from the Marfraq governorate were used to evaluate the effect of drought on food security in Jordan. This governorate was chosen because most of its land receives low levels of precipitation. The crops selected for analysis were rain-fed crops: olives, wheat, and barley. The precipitation data series were examined for normality distribution, and they were found to be normally distributed. Six drought severity classes were estimated by the Mafraq Governorate during 1995–2017. The highest drought occurrence was near normal drought (15 observation years), followed by moderate drought (3 years), extreme drought (2 years), and very wet and moderately wet (1 year each). The quantitative analysis for the effect of a drought occurrence on crop production was estimated using a regression equation with the assumption of increasing the average temperatures by 1 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C. A conceptual model was designed to evaluate the impact of agricultural drought on some components of food security in Jordan. The standardized regression coefficients were estimated using the path analysis method. The total effect of drought on food availability was 0.68 standard deviations; the effect for food access was 7.01 standard deviations, and food utilization was 14.63 standard deviations. Climate change, especially drought occurrence, has a negative effect on food security. Crop yields are reduced with high temperatures. Additionally, weeds cover the land, and pest numbers increase, causing more damage. Crop production decreases substantially with low precipitation levels or long droughts. A drought’s indirect effects are evident through changes in irrigation water availability. The main purpose of this research is to understand the impact of drought on food security in Jordan by evaluating the drought effect on agricultural production and sociodemographic-economic aspects.Please confirm if the author names are presented accurately and in the correct sequence (given name, middle name/initial, family name).

Acta Logistica,"Last mile supply system takes great importance in the designed supply chain management, especially in the big urban areas, where various goods delivery locations should be tackled. Transportation routes and vehicles play a critical share in the optimization of the energy spent in this system because it is considered a complicated case due to its high solutions possibilities. Also, part of these transport processes is considered reverse logistics, where the goods take the way back, starting from the customer. Using a metaheuristic optimization is usually a good way to increase operations efficiency and save time and energy, next to raising sustainability. Within this paper, the last mile supply system within urban areas focusing on the goods' delivery and collection tasks is presented. The model design is described, mathematical optimization modelling is detailed, and a case study to investigate the impact of using diesel and electric trucks on energy efficiency is solved. After an introduction and theoretical background that includes a brief literature review, the designed system and used methodology are described. The designed system incorporates cloud computing, real routes of vehicles, analysis of collected data, energy consumption optimization, and time windows. Also, a mathematical model is developed with the aim of optimizing the total energy consumption. Real thirty locations in Budapest in the VII district are described and used as a case study for finding the solutions of the optimized taken routes and energy consumption by the genetic algorithm for both diesel and electric trucks.

This case explores the supply chain issues faced by Tallat Mehmood, who is the Managing Director of the company, during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2021. Oxygen cylinders have become the need of the hour as more and more patients need oxygen. The supply of medical gases across Pakistan has become a logistical issue, causing hospital reserves to be drained without timely replenishment. Increasing the number of beds in hospitals, with limited oxygen outlets, has increased the demand for oxygen cylinders. Operating under unstable demand and not being able to meet it has caused Tallat to realize that the company is out of its comfort zone and is not responding well to the environment.

Journal of Industrial Ecology,"Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely applied to assessing the environmental impacts of information and communication technologies (ICT) products throughout their lifetime. Building upon LCA methodology, this study proposes a user-oriented, functionality-based LCA (FLCA) framework that evaluates the environmental impact of multifunctional ICT products such as smartphones. Incorporating the quality function deployment and LCA literature, we develop an approach that highlights the linkages among user behavior, product functionalities, and product environmental footprints. We use matrix algebra to outline a computational method and a streamlined process to operationalize such analysis. FLCA analyzes the impact of materials in the context of how they are used. To illustrate the concept with a simple example, our first case study calculates the manufacturing GHG emissions of a well-known multifunctional product, a Swiss Army knife. In the second case study, we estimate the functionality-based GHG emissions of a hypothetical smartphone. We consider various scopes of impact, including at the levels of device, infrastructure, and supply chains. Extending from LCA methods, FLCA moves away from a general understanding of functionality to a more granular perspective to accommodate the complexity in modern ICT products.

Over recent decades, its use in the agri-food sector has risen sharply, and alongside this, a wide range of methodological advances have been generated. Spatial-life cycle assessment, defined in the current document as the interpretation of life cycle assessment results within a geographical nature, has not gone unexplored entirely, yet its rise as a sub-method of life cycle assessment has been rather slow relative to other avenues of research (e.g., including the nutritional sciences within life cycle assessment). With this relative methodological stagnation as a motivating factor, our paper combines a process-based model, the Catchment Systems Model, with various life cycle impact assessments (ReCiPe, Centre for Environmental Studies and Environmental Product Declaration) to propose a simple, yet effective, approach for visualising the technically feasible efficacy of various on-farm intervention strategies. As water quality was the primary focus of this study, interventions reducing acidification and eutrophication potentials of both arable and livestock farm types in the Southeast of England were considered. The study site is an area with a marked range of agricultural practices in terms of intensity. All impacts to acidification potential and eutrophication potential are reported using a functional unit of 1 ha. Percentage changes relative to baseline farm types, i.e., those without any interventions, arising from various mitigation strategies, are mapped using geographical information systems. This approach demonstrates visually how a spatially-orientated life cycle assessment could provide regional-specific information for farmers and policymakers to guide the restoration of certain waterbodies. A combination of multiple mitigation strategies was found to generate the greatest reductions in pollutant losses to water, but in terms of individual interventions, optimising farm-based machinery (acidification potential) and fertiliser application strategies (eutrophication potential) were found to have notable benefits.","McAuliffe G.A., Zhang Y., Collins A.L.",Assessing catchment scale water quality of agri-food systems and the scope for reducing unintended consequences using spatial life cycle assessment (LCA),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133636832&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.115563&partnerID=40&md5=60c97666225355f75fb9afbe6e7a6024
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Light-duty vehicles are the predominant means of road transport. As the world population is expected to increase significantly in the following decades, so too will the car fleet. Due to the rising population, and the implicitly higher travel demand, the energy demand of cars will increase too, and this will put a strain on current resources, with negative effects on the supply chain, possibly leading to more pollution. Many of the current sustainable transport models and frameworks attempt to predict the vehicle market share for different powertrains and the resulting impact based on scenarios that cater to the automotive market and industry demands. At the same time, most neglect aspects regarding resources’ depletion and storage demand. In this sense, this study proposes a coherent testing methodology based on the ratio between demand and supply in order to address the limitations of these studies, mainly related to the sustainable exploitation of available resources, which are analyzed herein in correlation with the current predictions. A sensitivity analysis is provided in order to evaluate the uncertainty of utilized predictions. As a result of this analysis, two novel scenarios for assessing the evolution of the vehicle market share are proposed by the authors. When compared to similar scenarios, it was shown that the proposed scenarios lead to noticeable benefits in reducing dependency on the resources associated with a demand of energy and raw materials and in mitigating air pollution, including related costs.","Machedon-Pisu M., Borza P.N.",Impact of the Light-Duty Vehicles’ Storage and Travel Demand on the Sustainable Exploitation of Available Resources and Air Pollution Abatement,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136384792&doi=10.3390%2fsu14148571&partnerID=40&md5=69b7a2a26c57054f6681e57da65b7b8b
Advanced Energy Materials,"Li-ion batteries (LIBs) can reduce carbon emissions by powering electric vehicles (EVs) and promoting renewable energy development with grid-scale energy storage. However, LIB production and electricity generation still heavily rely on fossil fuels at present, resulting in major environmental concerns. Are LIBs as environmentally friendly and sustainable as expected at the current stage? In the past 5 years, a skyrocketing growth of the EV market has been witnessed. LIBs have garnered huge attention from academia, industry, government, non-governmental organizations, investors, and the general public. Tremendous volumes of LIBs are already implemented in EVs today, with a continuing, exponential growth expected for the years to come. When LIBs reach their end-of-life in the next decades, what technologies can be in place to enable second-life or recycling of batteries? Herein, life cycle assessment studies are examined to evaluate the environmental impact of LIBs, and EVs are compared with internal combustion engine vehicles regarding environmental sustainability. To provide a holistic view of the LIB development, this Perspective provides insights into materials development, manufacturing, recycling, legislation and policy, and beyond.

"Energy, Ecology and Environment","Like many countries, Indonesia generates large quantities of food waste. Food waste is poorly managed due to inadequate treatment practices, which has a harmful impact on the environment. This paper demonstrates the high potential for food waste valorization in Indonesia and outlines the optimal valorization pathways to inform future decision-making surrounding the management of this waste. This paper also compares various conversion technologies for transforming food waste into liquid, solid, and gaseous biofuels. The challenges and opportunities for wider implementation are also considered, including the integration of supply chains and the logistics of food waste management, the technological feasibility, and the persistent behaviors surrounding food waste and energy in Indonesia. The economic and environmental benefits, the perspectives of improved food waste management practices and sustainable fuels, as well as the policy landscape surrounding waste and sustainable energy are also explored. The challenges of scalability and commercialization are also highlighted in this paper. This review demonstrates the best pathways from food waste valorization to bioenergy, including biogas or biodiesel integrated with a black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) composting system. Despite the scale of resources in Indonesia, the pathways and technologies for processing food waste are lacking.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Limited transparency on the sustainability of the lithium-ion battery supply chain (LIBSC) could impede a rapid scale-up of the electric vehicle battery ecosystem, which is required for the decarbonization of the transportation sector. A comprehensive and commonly accepted framework to assess the sustainability of this industry is currently missing. To address this research gap, a mixed-methods approach comprising a literature review, several expert interviews, two workshops, and a two-round Delphi study is conducted. 29 aspects concerning the LIBSC's sustainability are derived and prioritized according to their importance and ease of implementation. Furthermore, 30 barriers for establishing the required transparency in the LIBSC are identified. The results show that a broad range of criteria has to be incorporated to comprehensively evaluate battery sustainability. Thereby, greenhouse gas emissions, circularity indicators, and human rights and safety issues are considered the most crucial, while the least importance is attributed to economic aspects. A broad range of barriers to such assessments are identified, many of which stem from the interaction and relationships among supply chain tiers or originate at one tier and affect another upstream or downstream counterpart. Overall, the study's results indicate that assuring compliance with existing sustainability standards might be a feasible and pragmatic approach to cope with the considerable variety of important sustainability aspects. Moreover, the identified barriers imply that meaningful assessments can only be achieved via cross-tier assessments and considerable collaborations among the stakeholders of the rapidly evolving LIBSC.","Gebhardt M., Beck J., Kopyto M., Spieske A.",Determining requirements and challenges for a sustainable and circular electric vehicle battery supply chain: A mixed-methods approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133700293&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.06.024&partnerID=40&md5=1881b658f2d2997d392aa4941c84477f
"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a key role in advancing electromobility. With an increasing trend in the demand for LIBs, the sustainability prospect of LIBs lifecycle faces many challenges that require proactive approaches. There are various sustainability challenges and risks across the supply and value chains of LIBs from mining, material supplies to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), users to final disposal. Risks are for example the increased raw material demands as well as some economic risks due to price increment or political instabilities in some countries within the raw material supply chain. Despite the promising research efforts on the performance metrics of LIBs and advancing the technology, the research on the various aspects of sustainability of LIBs and its life cycle are still in its infancy and require closer attention. As the editorial of the Special Issue on sustainable supply and value chains of EV batteries, this article presents some of the most pressing challenges of EV LIBs across the different stages of its life cycle. It covers issues from supply and demand of the battery raw materials, battery manufacturing, use, and end-of-life treatments. Within this context the reported findings of some 20 different research teams from across the globe, the state-of-the-art, technical or policy gaps in EV LIBs research and development are presented, as well as market instruments such as innovative business models, and governmental interventions like subsidies or regulations. We grouped the materials presented into five main themes (1) EV and LIB materials demand projections (2) EV LIBs international trade risk (3) EV battery regulation and adoption (4) EV LIBs life cycle assessment (5) and EV LIBs reverse logistics. We conclude by discussing some future research challenges such as the need for more reliable and applicable prediction models that use accurate data on EV stock and end-of-life EVs. Finally, we argue that more collaboration between academia, manufactures, OEMs and the battery recycling industry is needed to implement successful circular economy strategies to achieve environmentally friendly, flexible and cost-efficient battery supplies, use and recycling processes.","Rajaeifar M.A., Ghadimi P., Raugei M., Wu Y., Heidrich O.",Challenges and recent developments in supply and value chains of electric vehicle batteries: A sustainability perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122530411&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2021.106144&partnerID=40&md5=a3dd172b5bc831c1bc299d751a043854
"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Lithium-ion battery recycling can decrease life cycle environmental impacts of electric vehicles (EVs) and assist in securing domestic supply chains. However, the US, the third largest market for EVs, has no policies for recycling of batteries at their end-of-life. The European Union has proposed recycled content standards (RCSs) to help drive a circular battery ecosystem. This analysis calculates feasible RCSs for the US based on future sale projections, techno-economic assessment, life cycle assessment, and material flow analysis. Using a 95% confidence interval, results show that 11–12% of cobalt, 7–8% of lithium, and 10–12% of nickel demand in 2030 and 15–18%, 9–11%, and 15–17%, respectively, in 2035, could be met by retired supply assuming closed-loop recycling. While domestic recycling can be profitable at scale and reduce environmental impacts, it is more expensive than exporting to China for recycling. Consequently, policy is likely needed to ensure critical materials are recycled domestically.","Dunn J., Kendall A., Slattery M.","Electric vehicle lithium-ion battery recycled content standards for the US – targets, costs, and environmental impacts",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133936004&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2022.106488&partnerID=40&md5=075d453e6574c24bfba91ea260a25615
Journal of Sustainable Forestry,"Loggers play critical roles in forest management and resource production, yet supply chain pressures can challenge their economic sustainability. We examine logger perspectives on efficiency, financial challenges, and potential solutions from two contrasting perspectives: 1) business strategy and 2) treadmill of production, a sociological critique of resource production that links economic and ecological sustainability. To provide in-depth perspectives based on lived experiences, we conducted interviews with professional loggers and other stakeholders, focusing on firms with mechanized cut-to-length systems in Wisconsin and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. Our qualitative analysis revealed the intersection of factors that help explain financial stress. Loggers work on contract or buy stumpage from landowners and then sell to mills. Perceived challenges included competition in stumpage markets, relationships to mills that disadvantaged small firms, debt from mechanization, and site access through variable environmental conditions. Loggers worked to increase efficiency and production volume, though some loggers expressed the limits of increasing efficiency and production for improving profitability. Proposed solutions to reduce financial stress included long-term mill contracts, access to loans, and improved financial literacy. Nonetheless, individual firm efficiency will not address structural challenges such as loggers’ role in the supply chain between landowners and mills.","Rissman A.R., Geisler E., Gorby T., Rickenbach M.G.",“Maxed Out on Efficiency”: Logger Perceptions of Financial Challenges Facing Timber Operations,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095858498&doi=10.1080%2f10549811.2020.1841008&partnerID=40&md5=eb1700c12f75b8749ac53b7319a41ed3
Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Logistics network is one of the most important parts of supply chains with significant share in achieving sustainability across them. In this paper, we investigate a new multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model for the design of multimodal logistics network. A bi-objective mathematical model is introduced and two conflicting objectives including the minimization of total cost and the total environmental impact are taken into account. Effective environmental life cycle assessment–based method is incorporated in the model to estimate the relevant environmental impacts. Due to budget constraints, financing decisions for facility construction are considered in the proposed model. To cope with the model objective functions, the augmented ε-constraint method is applied. Computational analysis is also provided by using a cement multimodal rail-road logistics network case study to present the significance of the proposed model. Results show that utilizing the proposed multi-period optimization model influences the location of multimodal terminals and their construction time. Also, the results show that the use of the proposed model enhances the efficiency of terminals.

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Logistics networks are significant for successful implementation of supply chain networks. Different configurations of logistics network exist regarding application areas and industrial requirements. One important consideration currently attracted the attention of researchers is sustainability focusing on economic, social and environmental factors. When the players of logistics network rises, the need for splitting functions among elements of the logistics network also increases. Therefore, in this paper a three-tier logistics network including supplier, producer and consumer is configured. Transportation is outsourced to a third-party logistics partner. Main factors of sustainability and their corresponding indices are collected and integrated to the tiers of the proposed logistics network. Collaboration is considered as a new concept to be embedded on the sustainable logistics network. Collaboration parameters are analyzed in a cubic space with logistics tiers and sustainability indices. Benefit-Cost-Value-Risk technique is developed for the computation purposes. The output is the sustainable value of the logistics network and significance score of collaboration parameters. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the impacts of collaboration and sustainability using sustainable value, significance of collaboration parameters on sustainability indices using significance score, and multi-aspect analysis in cubic space based on scenario planning. The numerical study emphasizes the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Africa Journal of Management,"Macro-level sustainability indicators have declined for African countries over the last three decades both in absolute terms and relative to non-African countries. Over these same years, trade relations for African exporters have changed significantly in terms of products exported as well as trade partners involved. In this paper, we explore several indicators that may link these changes in trade to the decline in sustainable development across Africa. We create a novel longitudinal dataset that combines specific configurations of products exported to different types of trade partners with country-level sustainability outcomes. We use time series models to identify which of these indicators are significantly associated with sustainability for African countries and compare those to the predominant viewpoints of African development such as the natural resource curse and the call for greater African self-reliance. We find an interesting set of non-results that contradict several common viewpoints, but we find a significant negative association between intra-African supply chain development and lower sustainability.

Mathematics,"Managers implement several Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practices to improve sustainability and economic performance, such as environmental management systems (EMS), eco-design (ED), source reduction (SR) and attending to external environmental management (EEM) requirements; however, the relationship among them requires a deep study. This paper reports the case of the Mexican maquiladora industry, analyzing the main relationships among GSCM practices with environmental impact (EI) and environmental cost savings (ECS). The analysis reports three structural equation models (SEM) developed as simple, second-order, and mediating models. Those relationships are tested using 160 responses to a survey applied to the Mexican maquiladora industry and with partial least squares algorithms (PLS), where conditional probabilities for different scenarios in latent variables are also reported. Findings indicate that EMS has a direct effect on EI (β = 0.442) and ECS (β = 0.227), indicating that EMS reduces EI and cost associated with the production process; however, ED has no direct effect on EI (β = 0.019) and ECS ((β = 0.006), and it can be due to the maquiladora nature as foreign companies focused on manufacturing and not to product design.","García Alcaraz J.L., Díaz Reza J.R., Arredondo Soto K.C., Hernández Escobedo G., Happonen A., Puig I Vidal R., Jiménez Macías E.",Effect of Green Supply Chain Management Practices on Environmental Performance: Case of Mexican Manufacturing Companies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131697354&doi=10.3390%2fmath10111877&partnerID=40&md5=0c9553074e16f5b325b1f984923f87cb

The current study evaluated value chain of mangrove wood products from Lamu, Kenya, and how these impacts on resources’ sustainability. Results show that, exploitation of mangrove wood products in Kenya involves several actors, including national regulator, licensees, cutters, transporters, stockists and the consumers. Based on the differences between allowable and harvest data, Lamu mangroves can be said to be under-exploited. For the 1992–2018 period, an average of 223.5 scores ha−1yr−1 of mangrove poles were target for harvesting from Lamu. During the same period, the harvest data indicate an average of 6.2 scores ha−1yr−1 of mangrove poles were removed. However, based on stand level data generated as part of this study, mangroves in Lamu are over-exploited and stocked with non-merchantable poles. There are differentiated net income among various actors in mangrove trade in Kenya. Mangrove cutters are among the ‘losers’ in mangrove trade value chain earning a monthly net income of USD118.6 ± 17.9.

Journal of Environmental Management,"Many companies and organizations are pursuing “carbon footprint” projects to estimate their own contribution due to growing concerns about global climate change and carbon emissions. Measures such as carbon taxes are the most powerful means of dealing with the threats of climate change. In recent years, researchers have shown a particular interest in modelling supply chain networks under this scheme. Disorganized disposal of by-products from sugarcane mills is the inspiration of this research. In order to connect the problem with the real world, the proposed sustainable sugarcane supply chain network considers carbon taxes on the emission from industries and during transportation of goods. The presented mixed-integer linear programming modelling is a location-allocation problem and, due to the inherent complexity, it is considered a Non-Polynomial hard (NP-hard) problem. To deal with the model, three superior metaheuristics Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Social Engineering Optimizer (SEO) and hybrid methods based on these metaheuristics, namely, Genetic-Simulated Annealing (GASA) and Genetic-Social Engineering Optimizer (GASEO), are employed. The control parameters of the algorithms are tuned using the Taguchi approach. Subsequently, one-way ANOVA is used to elucidate the performance of the proposed algorithms, which compliments the performance of the proposed GASEO.","Chouhan V.K., Khan S.H., Hajiaghaei-Keshteli M.",Sustainable planning and decision-making model for sugarcane mills considering environmental issues,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120830897&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2021.114252&partnerID=40&md5=6e5dc2b6a30dd397e94d3c0a6b1af680
EMJ - Engineering Management Journal,"Many companies embrace Industry 4.0 technologies to enable operational sustainability against increasing climate change effects, decreasing natural resources, and raising consumer awareness of environmental issues. Even though readiness and maturity assessment of smartness and sustainability concepts are nested, no study simultaneously focuses on these concepts. As pioneering research, we propose a novel model titled “Smart and Sustainable Supply chain Readiness and Maturity model (S3RM)” and validate it by conducting a case study in the automotive industry. We design our model upon the triple-bottom-line (TBL) approach consisting of smartness and sustainability dime5nsions. Our study introduces the TBL of smartness covering availability, integrity, and adaptability sub-dimension. TBL of sustainability includes social, environmental, and economic sub-dimensions. The proposed model calculates the Smart and Sustainable Readiness and Maturity Index by averaging sustainability scores’ summation and smartness scores’ multiplication. Each sub-dimension consists of items measured by a readiness and maturity scale. The findings suggest how smartness and sustainability items create strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for the supply chain operations. Our model provides managerial implications in assessing the readiness and maturity of Industry 4.0 tools and sustainability indicators.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Many companies face challenges in reducing their supply chain costs while increasing sustainability and customer service levels. A comprehensive framework for a sustainable closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network is a practical solution to these challenges. Hence, for the first time, this study considers an integrated multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model to design sustainable CLSC networks with cross-docking, location-inventory-routing, time window, supplier selection, order allocation, transportation modes with simultaneous pickup, and delivery under uncertainty. An intelligent simulation algorithm is proposed to produce CLSC network data with probabilistic distribution functions and feasible solution space. In addition, a fuzzy goal programming approach is proposed to solve the MOMILP model under uncertainty. Eight small and medium-size test problems are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model with the simulated data in GAMS software.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Many developing countries on the equator, including Indonesia, have the potential for renewable and sustainable resources, such as solar energy. However, despite the enormous potential, the adoption level remains low. Previously, several studies discussed the potential, the feasibility, and the supporting policy of this technology, but none have been discussed from the customers’ perspective on a national scale. Therefore, this study attempts to determine the factors affecting the customers’ intention to use solar photovoltaics in Indonesia to develop a sustainable circular supply chain for renewable energy. This investigation was conducted based on integrating the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Furthermore, an online questionnaire was successfully distributed with a total of 208 participants. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to derive the causal relationships of the proposed hypotheses. The results indicated that price value (PV) has a positive relationship and a significant influence on attitude toward use (ATU), which leads to the behavioral intention (BI) to make the construct the most affecting factor. This is the first comprehensive study to analyze the intention to use rooftop solar panels based on the UTAUT2 and TPB framework. The successful approach to support photovoltaic use will bring less waste and strengthen the circular supply chain to support sustainable development.","Bekti D.B.M., Prasetyo Y.T., Redi A.A.N.P., Budiman A.S., Mandala I.M.P.L., Putra A.R., Persada S.F., Nadlifatin R., Young M.N.",Determining factors affecting customer intention to use rooftop solar photovoltaics in Indonesia,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121977155&doi=10.3390%2fsu14010280&partnerID=40&md5=f9829123b4399ba1dc9db6f1e4af2cf1
Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy,"Many developments in the bioeconomy depend on the use of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs). GMMs are used in bioreactors to convert biomass into food, feed, and energy products. The recent judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union on gene editing technologies has affected the use of GMMs. A heated debate has started on whether and under what circumstances GMMs should be considered genetically modified organisms. This kind of decision is extremely relevant, as it will have a strong effect on the innovation of sustainable supply chains in the bioeconomy. The question has been raised as to whether the regulatory policies on GMMs can be justified from a sustainability perspective and, in particular, whether they do not endanger the European Green Deal, the flagship policy strategy of the new European Commission under Ursula von der Leyen. This contribution will first provide an overview of GMMs and their importance for the development of the bioeconomy, followed by a theoretical framework for assessing investments in GMMs. The third part of the article includes a discussion of four scenarios for regulating GMMs in the future, derived from the EU legal environment. The potential implications of the scenarios are assessed by linking them with the benefits and costs of investments in GMMs, following a modified version of the model presented in Purnhagen and Wesseler (2019). The results show that reforms based on the current EU legal environment do not look very promising to further support the use of GMMs. This has important implications for reaching the objectives of the Green Deal, as more radical legal changes are needed for the success of the initiative.","Wesseler J., Kleter G., Meulenbroek M., Purnhagen K.P.",EU regulation of genetically modified microorganisms in light of new policy developments: Possible implications for EU bioeconomy investments,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128297317&doi=10.1002%2faepp.13259&partnerID=40&md5=1707a60f65a43fd5ed27ca504632b1ed
Global Public Health,"Many implementation efforts experience interruptions, especially in settings with developing health systems. Approaches for evaluating interruptions are needed to inform re-implementation strategies. We sought to devise an approach for evaluating interruptions by exploring the sustainability of a programme that implemented diabetes mellitus (DM) screening within tuberculosis clinics in Uganda in 2017. In 2019, we conducted nine interviews with clinic staff and observed clinic visits to determine their views and practices on providing integrated care. We mapped themes to a social ecological model with three levels derived from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR): outer setting (i.e. community), inner setting (i.e. clinic), and individuals (i.e. clinicians). Respondents explained that DM screening ceased due to disruptions in the national supply chain for glucose test strips, which had cascading effects on clinics and clinicians. Lack of screening supplies in clinics limited clinicians’ opportunities to perform DM screening, which contributed to diminished self-efficacy. However, culture, compatibility and clinicians’ beliefs about DM screening sustained throughout the interruption. We propose an approach for evaluating interruptions using the CFIR and social ecological model; other programmes can adapt this approach to identify cascading effects of interruptions and target them for re-implementation.","Hennein R., Ggita J., Ssuna B., Shelley D., Akiteng A.R., Davis J.L., Katamba A., Armstrong-Hough M.","Implementation, interrupted: Identifying and leveraging factors that sustain after a programme interruption",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119355223&doi=10.1080%2f17441692.2021.2003838&partnerID=40&md5=25afed633b0988ba53ae01f62760dd23
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Many pressing challenges that perennially affect countries today are those related to environmental sustainability. As major entities, business organizations play a primal role in boosting the economy, stakeholders are increasingly under pressure to achieve net zero emissions. However, in emerging economies, these entities are scarcely inclined towards implementation of newer environmental policies as they're oblivious to perils of excessive carbon emissions and its consequences. Therefore, it is essential to look for sustainability measures to secure a system that reduces the carbon footprint and ultimately reaches a zero-carbon future. This research proposes a method to identify and assess the barriers of carbon regulatory policies (CRPs) so that advancements in carbon emission reduction practices can be pursued; we present a specific focus on developing nations. An integrated multi-criteria decision-making approach is proposed to achieve environmental sustainability. Initially, the Best Worst Method is used to determine the relative importance of the barriers in the implementation of regulatory policies. Subsequently, we utilize Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory to establish interrelationships among the barriers of carbon policies.

"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","Many research projects require strong interactions between academics and practitioners. Academics often face the challenges of collecting sufficient, high-quality research data, while achieving the project aim and producing practical impact to industrial partners. This paper presents the design of a research tool for data collection that increases industrial engagement in a sustainable aquaculture project. The project aim was to explore digital solutions for improving sustainability of shrimp aquaculture industry in Indonesia. To better facilitate the data collection and industrial engagement, we adapt the life cycle thinking and multi-stakeholder concepts from an existing tool, known as Sustainable Value Analysis Tool, redesign the rationale, and develop a new research tool to meet the specific purposes of this project. The research tool is composed of three parts: mapping and clustering challenges, assessing challenges, and co-designing digital solutions. The research tool was used in a workshop with 12 industrial partners from various organizations across the aquaculture supply chains in Indonesia in August 2019. The findings show that the empirical data collected through this tool is richer and more comprehensive compared to semi-structured interviews, and that the use of the tool greatly improved the industrial engagement. The feedback from the industrial partners shows that the tool has effectively helped them engage in the research process and improved the communication between themselves. This paper therefore suggests that designing and using such research tools is an effective way for data collection and industrial engagement.","Yang M., Luis M., Hermawan D., Herlina L., Nayak R., Jensen J., Choudhary S., Ball P., Evans S.",Designing a Research Tool for Sustainable Aquaculture Project,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115840426&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-6128-0_26&partnerID=40&md5=ad12dd7426ba0b25bdf3fc10d9ebfa8b
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Many supply chains within developing countries lack transparency and are fraught with fraud, corruption, and a substantial number of intermediaries. For several decades, the cocoa sector has faced multiple social, economic, and environmental challenges, some of which include the issue of child labor and very low incomes for farmers, leading to poor living conditions. Blockchain technology has a high potential to reduce—or completely eradicate—some of these hurdles. In this article, we present a blockchain-based solution based on the open-source framework Hyperledger Fabric for the cocoa supply chain to promote transparency and reduce fraud. In doing so, we explicitly describe how farmers can be directly integrated into the whole blockchain solution considering the limited infrastructure, knowledge, and technologies available to them.

Competitive Government: Public Private Partnerships,"Mass rapid transit (MRT) PPPs have proliferated in the past two decades. This chapter provides a framework to categorise and understand alternative PPP designs. As MRT systems are inherently large, unprofitable and risky projects, PPP design is critical to project success and sustainability. We study the experiences of MRT PPPs in London, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing to understand factors underlying success and failure and to arrive at policy recommendations for PPPs. Policymakers need to have additional governance improvement and risk mitigation measures in place when tied supply chains are utilised. Hong Kong’s experience illustrates that ‘Rail plus Property’ strategy can facilitate synergies and cross-subsidization of rail from land value capture. Appropriate mechanisms for allocation of revenue risks are key to financial sustainability. The government should own MRT systems, but there are benefits of design-build-finance-operate-maintain-transfer PPPs for lines, private financing of rolling stock and private sector maintenance of assets and operation of train services.","Phang S.-Y., Tan B.C.",Sustainable Strategies for Mass Rapid Transit PPPs,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125507216&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-83484-5_9&partnerID=40&md5=9f0bb0cbdc8769f85972bc30052c2f56
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Massive expansions in the global population and the global digitalization throughout the industrial revolution are causing energy security issues that are no longer environmentally affordable through conventional power generation systems. As an alternative solution, the global power capacities and production of the renewable energy systems in general and the photovoltaic technologies in particular, are significantly increasing every year. With a lifetime range of 25–40 years, the PV power plants will eventually and over their lifetime or cumulatively turn into large masses of waste. This work briefly reviews the market state of the three generations of PV and summarizes their most recent technical challenges. It is highlighted that the c-Si (Crystalline Silicon) and CdTe (Cadmium Telluride) technologies have a relatively high level of market maturity, least number of technical challenges, and most interesting space for sustainable development. Furthermore, a one-of-a-kind sustainable and circular PV industry's business model was developed, to directly and indirectly address the practical business and engineering gaps concerning environmental, economic, social, and technical factors affecting the circular transition of the PV industry. The model assisted in reviewing and discussing articles concerning material compositions, manufacturing processes, and dismantling processes. Previous reviews and surveys reported the lack of dedicated PV dismantling facilities and miscommunications between the supply chain stages and logistics. Therefore, a critical review was done on the most recent and comprehensive articles related to the optimizations and improvements of the PV industry's sustainability towards the anticipated circular economy. Additionally, this work highlights the objectives, key constraints, and major strategies of the sustainability's environmental, economic, and social pillars within the photovoltaic industry and business stages, which introduced the possible contributions of the industry 4.0 technologies. Therefore, a brief section was dedicated to the possible utilizations of Industry 4.0 throughout the critical stages of the photovoltaics' economy.

Existing methods fail to assess all three sustainability aspects across supply chain partners when measuring sustainability performance. Hence, this paper aims to develop a new method that evaluates environmental, social, and economic sustainability aspects across the entire supply chain, from raw material providers to consumers to reverse logistics providers. By combining content analysis, expert's evaluation, fuzzy Shannon's Entropy, and fuzzy TOPSIS, we develop a novel approach to measure the end-to-end supply chain sustainability performance. Utilizing data from six sustainability reports published by large pharmaceutical companies we demonstrate the practicality and ease of application of the proposed solution. Results show that the developed method can be used by managers and policymakers to benchmark supply chains and evaluate the effectiveness of adopted sustainable supply chain initiatives. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis indicates that the results obtained from the proposed method are promising and robust.

Water Resources Management,"Measuring the level of collaboration in the sustainable supply chain (SSC) of water diversion projects is of great value to the sustainable operation of the project. To this end, a scientific and reasonable collaboration measurement method must be developed. Given the economic, environmental and social benefits of water diversion projects and based on the theory of the SCC, an order parameter index system for collaboration measurement was constructed in this study. The DEMATEL and analytic network process methods were used to compute the local and global weights of each order parameter. A total of 161 valid questionnaires were collected from residents along the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) to measure the collaboration on this project from 2018 to 2020. The results showed that the orderliness of the four flow subsystems of the middle route of the SNWDP increased annually. Compared with the other three flow subsystems, the knowledge flow subsystem showed a lower level of orderliness, suggesting that communication and exchanges among people along the route should be strengthened.

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Medication waste is a concern for today's society, from both environmental and public health perspectives. This study aims to contribute to the issue by presenting a mixed-methods approach to the problem through reverse logistics. First, a systematic literature review was performed to map the literature and identify the best practices implemented worldwide. The review also provided information for the second part of the study: a proposal for the improvement of Brazil's medications reverse logistics system, viewed from an information management perspective. The method proposed introduces a mechanism for estimating the quantity of unused medications that should be returned to the system. Three groups of stakeholders evaluated the proposal by answering a semi-structured questionnaire. The research also adopted Institutional Theory to draw its conclusions. The literature review revealed a concentration of studies in the United States, a country which has a major concern for public health. Brazil was the second most studied country in the literature: the majority of its studies relating to environmental aspects. Both countries, however, particularly recognize the need to improve the ways unused medication is collected from consumers and returned to the reverse logistics system, and see their respective governments as the main actors promoting this process. The measurement system proposed in this study supports the development of better reverse logistics systems for countries that use information systems to manage medication supply chains. Some resistance to the implementation of the improving method was observed in drugstores due to the costs involved; these costs should be shared with other stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector.","Lima P.A.B., Delgado F.C.M., Santos T.L.D., Florentino A.P.",Medications reverse logistics: A systematic literature review and a method for improving the Brazilian case,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129398773&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2021.100024&partnerID=40&md5=7b5810601544e0fc364b7a351c181fb1
Applied Energy,"Methanol is a key product in the chemical industry, not only for producing other higher economic value chemicals, but also serves as a source of renewable energy that can substantially reduce carbon emissions. However, limited data are available on methanol total supply chain costs that consists of production, biomass cost, investment cost and the efficiency of the conversion processes. This paper recommends using an agent-based simulation–optimization in analyzing and reporting results by system elements (techno-economic assessment) or unit processes (life cycle assessment) as well as by the overall product system, of methanol supply chain. Major decision making are included in the agent-based simulation–optimization model to evaluate methanol synthesis pathways. This evaluation includes biomass and methanol ordering policy, capital budgeting during the lifetime of the methanol supply chain, carbon emissions per metric ton of methanol with specific focus on contribution to Indonesia Gross Domestic Product. The principal results obtained from the agent-based simulation show a better conversion technology pathway that leads to lower carbon emissions, higher internal rate of return, shorter payback period, and less price sensitivity of the methanol supply chain.

Journal of Rural Studies,"Metrics that assess farmer sustainability performance have emerged as a leading approach to fostering continuous improvement in the sustainability of agriculture. As multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) have developed sustainability metrics for US agriculture, these initiatives are entering a new phase focused on the adoption of metrics. This paper examines the approaches being used by two MSIs, Field to Market and the Stewardship Index for Specialty Crops (SISC), to promote their respective metrics to farmers. Drawing on assemblage theory, we analyze the processes that MSIs are using to get their metrics implemented, and how the actual adoption of metrics takes place in agrifood supply chains. Specifically, we identify five processes that both Field to Market and SISC are using to facilitate the implementation of their metrics: (1) leveraging members, (2) utilizing supply chains, (3) providing technical assistance, (4) building technological platforms, and (5) creating partnerships. In identifying these processes, our analysis shifts understanding of metrics adoption beyond just consumer and market forces, and focuses attention on the specific actors and processes through which sustainability metrics are put into practice.

IEEE Access,"Mexican maquiladoras have a complex and intensive supply chain because they import raw materials from other countries and export their final products. This paper reports a structural equation model with three independent variables associated with supply chain sustainability (Inbound sustainability, Internal sustainability, and Outbound sustainability) and two variables related to external entities integration (Supplier integration and Customer integration). Those variables are related to three dependent variables as sustainability indicators (Business performance, Social performance, and Environmental performance). Variables are related by ten hypotheses that are validated using the partial least squares technique integrated into WarpPLS v.7® software, and information comes from 187 responses to a questionnaire applied to managers and engineers laboring at the Mexican maquiladora industry. The research objective is to know the relationship among variables to increase performance based on sustainable activities. Findings indicate that, given the nature of maquiladora industry, Supplier integration does not moderate the relationship between Inbound sustainability and Internal sustainability. In addition, Customer integration does not moderate the relationship between Internal sustainability and Outbound sustainability.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Minimising environmental impacts and prioritising the production of nutritious foods are essential qualities of a sustainable food system. Ultra-processed foods (UFPs) are potentially counterproductive to these objectives. This review aims to summarise the magnitude and types of environmental impacts resulting from each stage of the UPF supply chain and to develop a conceptual framework to display these impacts. It also aims to identify the terms used to describe UPFs in the sustainability literature, and the methods used to measure the associated environmental impacts. A narrative review approach with a systematic search strategy was used. Fifty-two studies were included that either described or quantified the environmental impacts of UPFs. This review found that UPFs are responsible for significant diet-related environmental impacts. Included studies reported that UPFs accounted for between 17 and 39% of total diet-related energy use, 36–45% of total diet-related biodiversity loss, up to one-third of total diet-related greenhouse gas emissions, land use and food waste and up to one-quarter of total diet-related water-use among adults in a range of high-income countries. These results varied depending on the scope of the term used to describe UPFs, stages of the lifecycle included in the analyses and country. Studies also identified that UPF production and consumption has impacts on land degradation, herbicide use, eutrophication and packaging use, although these impacts were not quantified in relation to dietary contribution. The findings highlight that environmental degradation associated with UPFs is of significant concern due to the substantial resources used in the production and processing of such products, and also because UPFs are superfluous to basic human needs. The conceptual framework and findings presented can be used to inform food policy and dietary guideline development, as well as provide recommendations for future research.","Anastasiou K., Baker P., Hadjikakou M., Hendrie G.A., Lawrence M.",A conceptual framework for understanding the environmental impacts of ultra-processed foods and implications for sustainable food systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135820073&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.133155&partnerID=40&md5=49a508e6ac7dbbd7b1ecad2ec257ce03
Mineral Economics,"Mining activities have always raised environmental and social concerns due to their impact on natural resources and people. During the last decade, the stakeholder base expected to respond to these sustainability concerns has broadened from directly involved parties to a range of indirect stakeholders along the downstream mineral value chain. These stakeholders variably engage in reporting, supplier risk assessments, exercising supply chain due diligence, third party assurance, and corporate social responsibility measures. This trend reflects a combination of societal, investor, and regulatory pressure as well as industry self-regulation along the supply chain. The present article examines this development from the complementary perspectives of international regulations and voluntary industry and multi-stakeholder initiatives affecting the industrial and the artisanal mining sector as well as the associated mineral supply chains. To this end, we provide an introductory analysis on the global uptake, implementation challenges, and lessons learnt with regard to both regulatory developments and voluntary initiatives. Key challenges identified include a misalignment between local reforms and international efforts, heterogeneous downstream market requirements, and evasive strategies as well as gaps to report on and achieve positive local sustainability impacts, partly brought about by emphasising corporate risk management over local community priorities. Meaningful stakeholder dialogue and increased local ownership are key factors to overcome some of these challenges.","Franken G., Schütte P.",Current trends in addressing environmental and social risks in mining and mineral supply chains by regulatory and voluntary approaches,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126066271&doi=10.1007%2fs13563-022-00309-3&partnerID=40&md5=9c4625367256293293e46be1c8339da8
International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications,"Modern slavery is a complex and challenging phenomenon that may hinder the sustainable development of the global supply chain. However, there is no existing academic review on modern slavery in supply chains. This study conducts a systematic literature review to synthesise this body of literature. We searched keywords in the Scopus database and identified 44 articles published between 2013 and 2022 to identify critical themes and propose a conceptual framework capturing the relationships among the identified themes. Through our analysis, three themes of modern slavery in supply chains were identified: antecedents (analyzed from regulatory, organisational, and social perspectives); practices (e.g. practices to mitigate modern slavery in supply chains); and outcomes (e.g. business compliance).

International Conference on Higher Education Advances,"MOOC landscape is evolving, also boosted by distance-learning necessity of recent health crises. Logistics is an interdisciplinary area across business processes and functions, engineering, global views and sustainability. As lifelong learning appears a new norm and it is difficult for HEIs to provide a programme with both sufficient focus on foundational skills as well as topical expertise, students and practitioners can turn to MOOCs for complementary instruction. This study presents a data collected from 198 logistics-Themed MOOCs across four major platforms (edX, Coursera, FutureLearn and Udemy) to evaluate the topical availability across main areas of direct logistics expertise. Regardless of relative abundance, the study suggests both thematic gaps and criticism of MOOC development priorities.

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","More attention has been paid to the circular economy in recent years due to a focus on sustainability. Reverse logistics is an example of this, as it is critical for embracing and implementing the circular economy concept across supply chains. Nowadays, consumers are affecting every aspect of sustainability due to social media's exponential growth. This paper addressed a knowledge gap in sustainability and consumer behavior, which significantly impacts managerial decisions in reverse logistics, leading to reduced waste on returning products. The concept of sustainability is broadened by emphasizing specific aspects, including consumers, profit, the environment, and the company's employees. Additionally, an extended conceptual model of sustainability was proposed, discussed, and analyzed to determine the relationship between reverse logistics performance and sustainability using a brand-new linguistic interval-value hesitant fuzzy DEMATEL technique. The proposed model could be applied to various industries, including food, automotive, and electronics. To this end, the electronics and automotive industries were analyzed and compared. The findings indicated that, in the context of sustainability and to achieve more sustainable reverse logistics, consumers as a new stakeholder, in addition to other stakeholders, play a critical role. The study results could aid managers in governing reverse logistics in a circular economy ecosystem that is sustainable. Additionally, the model proposed in this paper enables policymakers and decision-makers to gain additional insights into developing a more resilient sustainable supply chain.","Shahidzadeh M.H., Shokouhyar S.",Toward the closed-loop sustainability development model: a reverse logistics multi-criteria decision-making analysis,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126081923&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-022-02216-7&partnerID=40&md5=35fc349aa1cd8738e6c89b76033fb2f0
Journal of Cleaner Production,"More than 500 companies engaged in supply chains of forest-risk commodity have adopted zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs). We use corporate social responsibility strategy and policy implementation theories to analyse the processes and conditions for ZDC implementation. We base our study on 35 semi-structured interviews with company representatives and sector actors, publicly available ZDC data, and company reports. The objective is to understand the opportunities and challenges of ZDC implementation at the level of companies. While past research addressed ZDC coverage and effectiveness, knowledge is still lacking on companies' perspectives on the implementation of their commitments. This study provides a unique perspective by integrating the direct experience and knowledge of private actors on an environmental governance regime. We find that companies see implementation of ZDCs as a journey and often rely on voluntary sustainability standards, aligning their strategies and key performance indicators (KPIs) to these. They engage directly in the supply chain, conducting projects “on-the-ground.” Implementing ZDCs requires the involvement of procurement departments and upper management, and collaborations within and between companies. Companies rely on service providers for in-depth knowledge and field implementation. They use monitoring tools, e.g. remote sensing, and see supply chain traceability as a prerequisite for implementation. Companies face numerous implementation challenges. Internally, companies often lack leadership on their ZDC, struggle to align commitments with the organization's operations and to manage suppliers, especially smallholders, and allocate insufficient resources. Externally, they lack common standards and stakeholder support, and face challenging regulatory conditions and missing market incentives. An uneven playing field creates leakage markets. Companies identify better leadership, technology and pre-competitive collaboration as potential solutions. Zero-deforestation commitments are unlikely to greatly contribute to reducing deforestation until better implementation processes, mechanisms, and conditions are in place.","Bager S.L., Lambin E.F.",How do companies implement their zero-deforestation commitments,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138476376&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.134056&partnerID=40&md5=3b5a3d5c42f83c6059a9949e8659aecb
Cleaner Engineering and Technology,"Most of the consumers relied heavily on e-commerce for products and services for the past few years due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This kind of an unexpected behaviour among the consumer society has taken every industry by surprise so that many industries have begun operating online and offline businesses to ensure future competitiveness. Firms introducing online sales are deplorably facing many challenges in terms of logistics and delivery processes, such as short lead times, flexible delivery, capacity of warehouse, and the production process for controlling carbon emissions. Keeping these challenges in mind, a sustainable dual-channel vendor-buyer supply chain model has considered for a controllable emission under fuzzy demand and energy consumption. The model deals with limitation on warehouse floor-space area, and the warehouse divides into two stages such as one for satisfying online orders and the other for satisfying offline orders. The demand rate and energy consumptions are treated as the trapezoidal fuzzy number, and we use the signed distance method to defuzzify the fuzzy joint expected total cost. The objective focuses on obtaining a trade-off between cost and emissions, thereby determining the optimal production-distribution strategy and a proper sustainable plan for handling both online and offline orders. The aforesaid scenario is mathematically formulated in the form of constrained non-linear programme (NLP) and derive a Lagrangean multiplier method to solve it. An iterative solution algorithm is designed, and for better illustration of the developed theory, numerical analysis is carried out followed by a wide discussion on the sensitivity analysis for various parameters. Our results indicate that the optimal solutions of the sustainable fuzzy model slightly fluctuate from the solutions of the sustainable crisp model. According to results, considering the uncertainty in the system is a crucial factor to achieve the economic and environmental sustainability of the production sector. The research reveals that the practitioners should be careful in accounting flexibility in the input factors demand and energy to tackle the uncertainties that always fit the real situation.","Priyan S., Udayakumar R., Mala P., Prabha M., Ghosh A.",A sustainable dual-channel inventory model with trapezoidal fuzzy demand and energy consumption,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122632097&doi=10.1016%2fj.clet.2022.100400&partnerID=40&md5=0ce27133ec18ae5d40eb39023442d927
International Journal of Production Economics,"Most parts of the world have suffered the negative impacts from extreme weather events, in whatever form they may take. To mitigate such impacts, attention in the operations management literature has focused on how firms build resilience in their supply chains, in order to quickly respond to such events and also to return, as soon as possible, to a business-as-usual state. Prior studies have examined the process of building a supply chain (SC) in different countries, industries and in response to various disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, whilst, at the same time, calling for further research in different contexts. We respond to these calls by exploring SC resilience ability in the South African mining industry under extreme weather events. We situated our study in the dynamic capability view (DCV) view of the firm. We examined the direct effect of big data and predictive analytics (BDPA) capabilities on SC visibility and the final effects on community and resource resilience. We adopted a sequential mixed methods research design, collecting data from interviews with 10 industry practitioners and from 219 respondents to an online survey. We built and tested our theoretical model using partial least squares structured equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Notable theoretical contributions of our study are that big data enables a more efficient supply chain monitoring system, which, in turn, improves SC visibility. BDPA capability improves a company's ability to make the best use of its available resources. It improves the South African mining industry's dynamic capability, allowing them to adjust their strategies in response to diverse adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, BDPA capability's ability to improve SC visibility is enhanced when there is strong alignment between BDPA strategy and initiatives. Finally, having a high level of SC visibility helps develop community and resource resilience, which are necessary to ensure that firms in the industry fulfil their responsibilities in relation to social sustainability.","Bag S., Rahman M.S., Srivastava G., Chan H.-L., Bryde D.J.",The role of big data and predictive analytics in developing a resilient supply chain network in the South African mining industry against extreme weather events,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132511076&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108541&partnerID=40&md5=7d8223cc0e38c1f1a38475afa085ba1d

Sustainability Science,"Much sustainable development in agri-food systems is predicated upon increasing the production of agricultural commodities amid changing climates, political organization, and markets. While this growth in exports is critical for the expansion of alternative production supply chains like certified organic commodities markets, the long-term success of alternative agriculture development programs in helping farmers achieve a range of rural aspirations depends not on sociotechnical fixes for specific ecological problems, but on the creative and performative reorganizations of labor and value in farm spaces. Degrowth, a political-economic theory of reorganizing production to achieve socio-ecological sustainability over the long term, provides a framework to evaluate the lasting impact of alternative agricultural development or persistent smallholder farming beyond the production or sale of agricultural commodities. This paper draws on research with organic cotton and coffee farmers in India, as well as a brief case study with small-scale heritage farmers in Bosnia, to argue that sustainability, broadly conceived, must account for factors beyond resource-efficiency or yields. Small-scale organic farming in India and household allotments in Bosnia will never outperform agri-food commodities producers with respect to profits, yields, or sustained growth. However, a degrowth perspective suggests that these are the wrong metrics for sustainability.

IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics,"Multiple activities in the photovoltaic (PV) sector demonstrate a will to improve environmental impacts, reduce critical material uses and waste generated by linear supply chains. A common understanding of the remaining priority gaps in sustainability is, however, lacking, hindering the implementation of strategic courses of action.

This article introduces a framework to map sustainability strategies in PV under the lens of SDG 12. A gap analysis is conducted to identify the current sustainability performances of PV value chains. The readiness level of the sector to close each gap is then evaluated, thus highlighting the 'low hanging fruits' and the more consequent efforts required to achieve sustainability. Overall, a lack of common key performance indicators is noticed, resulting in a fragmented and uncertain sustainability landscape. A need for more coherence, sustainability leadership, and collaboration at the sectoral level is identified for all topics of SDG 12.

Energy Reports,"Natural gas is an essential fuel in the transition towards a sustainable energy future as it is a cleaner source of fuel compared to other hydrocarbon sources. To enable natural gas delivery from the producer to consumers, natural gas is liquified to enhance transportation efficiency and reliability. This study contributes towards advancing decision support systems within the LNG supply chain to enhance sustainability and resilience. Five scenarios are investigated in terms of vessel types (Conventional, Q-Flex, Q-Max, and mixed fleet), delivery operation modes (single discharge and multi-discharge), and different bunker fuels (HFO, LNG, and dual-fuel). The Mixed Integer Programming model is used to schedule, assign and deliver a fixed number of LNG cargoes within one month considering total transportation costs and emissions. The developed model, which is implemented using the Binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm subjected to economic and environmental objectives within an overarching strategic aim for sustainability and resilience. The results demonstrate that using LNG as a bunker fuel supports the reduction in the total emissions within LNG transportation leading to enhancing the resilience of LNG delivery operations against growing environmental constraints. Outputs of the study indicate that the multi-discharge LNG-fuelled operation mode can achieve a cost reduction of 23.4% and a total emission reduction of 19.7% relative to a single discharge operation mode, where boil-off gas has a minor impact compared to the emissions released from fuel consumption.","Al-Haidous S., Govindan R., Elomri A., Al-Ansari T.",An optimization approach to increasing sustainability and enhancing resilience against environmental constraints in LNG supply chains: A Qatar case study,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135935848&doi=10.1016%2fj.egyr.2022.07.120&partnerID=40&md5=16311a85d95da9974ccdc333d2103fb2
Case Studies in Construction Materials,"Network Rail is tackling the problem of the GHG (primarily CO2) emissions it produces and is committed to the Government's pledge to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050. It recently published its Environmental Sustainability Strategy 2020–2050 (Network Rail, 2020 [1]), which includes setting Science Based Targets for its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. In this context, Expedition Engineering has been supporting Network Rail's Technical Authority and Decarbonisation Programme in efforts to reduce the CO2e associated with its construction projects, primarily on those using concrete. This has included developing a Routemap to Net Zero Carbon Concrete, partnering with existing supply chains to decarbonise precast platform components used in high volume, and a feasibility piece focused on enabling significant carbon reductions in the ready-mix supply chain. The work has revealed the current difficulties and potential solutions within the UK concrete industry, as well as the value of supply chain partnering and putting research into practice. This paper summarises a combination of works completed and ongoing, and preliminary proposals under review. The route to Net Zero by 2050 must involve reduction in material quantities through design and construction efficiencies and a shift to using and developing materials with reduced CO2e intensity. In the immediate term this will mean maximising Portland cement replacement and accelerating adoption of current state-of-the-art low carbon technology. In the medium- to long-term it is anticipated that use of calcined clay and limestone as cement replacement will form a key part in the progress to reduce CO2e as the availability of PFA and GGBS reduces.

First, the results confirm that SBMs need to be supported by strong alignment with sustainability practices within the entire supply chain to be successfully implemented. Secondly, the application of the proper practices of selection, monitoring, collaboration, and integration among supply chain partners within various SBMs is the key to achieving sustainability objectives.

Transport and logistics companies, including those involved in distribution of perishable goods, undertake different activities in order to reduce negative impact of transport on the environment. The purpose of the article is to determine the principles of sustainable distribution of perishable goods and to examine the current state and plans of its principles application in business practice on the cold port stores example. Contemporary problems of sustainable distribution of perishable cargo have been identified. Marketing research was used to identify the main directions of activities undertaken by port cold stores in the field of sustainable distribution of food perishable goods. The case study of port cold stores located in Poland was considered. According to the examined cold stores, economic and organizational factors are the most important among the factors set. The challenges faced by cold port stores in their efforts to comply with the principles of sustainable distribution were recognized. Moreover, research indicates that port cold stores are aware of their role in the sustainable distribution of perishable cargoes and strive to improve its conditions. As the result of the research, the areas of possible improvements in the functioning of cold stores have been specified. The article presents a new perspective on the problems of perishable cargo sustainable distribution as a link of supply chain.","Filina-Dawidowicz L., Wiktorowska-Jasik A.",Contemporary problems and challenges of sustainable distribution of perishable cargoes: Case study of Polish cold port stores,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108777863&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-021-01600-z&partnerID=40&md5=467a1e85926756df11626726ab3a5402
Decision Science Letters,"Nowadays, companies are recognizing their primordial roles and responsibilities towards the protection of the environment and save the natural resources. They are focusing on some contemporary activities such as Reverse Logistics which is economically and environmentally viable. However, the integration of such an initiative needs flows restructuring and supply chain management in order to increase sustainability and maximize profits. Under this background, this paper addresses an inventory control model for a reverse logistics system that deals with two separated types of demand, for new products and remanufactured products, with different selling prices. The model consists of a single shared machine between production and remanufacturing operations, while the machine is subject to random failures and repairs. Three stock points respectively for returns, new products and remanufactured products are investigated. Meanwhile, in this paper, a modeling of the problem with Discrete-Event simulation using Arena® was conducted. Regarding the purpose of finding, a near-optimal inventory control policy that minimizes the total cost, an optimization of the model based on Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithms was established. Computational examples and sensitivity analysis were performed in order to compare the results and the robustness of each proposed algorithm.

International Journal of Production Economics,"Nowadays, distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchain technology) can play significant roles in improving supply chain management and sustainability. Blockchain technology can support responsible sourcing and ensure compliance with environmental standards by boosting traceability and transparency in sustainable supply chains. Nevertheless, blockchain technology has not been widely applied in this field due to the lack of familiarity of managers with its intrinsic characteristics. This study investigates the performance improvement, arising from the blockchain implementation, to address the problem of managerial conservatism and this technology adoption. Accordingly, an analytical approach is proposed to identify blockchain technology adoption enablers and analyze their impact on supply chain performance. At first, the main enablers, derived from the literature review, are explored using network theory. The existing causal relationships between enablers are extracted based on a multi-expertise team members’ agreement. Then, the fuzzy inference system is employed to determine the weights of relationships between the identified enablers and supply chain performance-related targets. After modeling the extracted causal relationships using the fuzzy cognitive map model, a scenario is defined for each enabler, and its impact on improving supply chain performance is estimated by implementing the hybrid learning algorithm. Finally, the obtained outputs are used to prioritize the blockchain technology adoption enablers using the fuzzy data envelopment analysis model. The result of this study implies that the blockchain technology can have a significant impact on mineral supply chain performance by creating smart contracts and enhancing environmental sustainability, traceability, and transparency.","Yousefi S., Mohamadpour Tosarkani B.",An analytical approach for evaluating the impact of blockchain technology on sustainable supply chain performance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123853422&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108429&partnerID=40&md5=a1883c9fb784a4d0bf5cf63e85c8914c
Chemical Engineering Transactions,"Nowadays, energy self-sufficiency cannot ignore the environmental sustainability of how it is achieved. On the other hand, one of the largest waste disposal components of a reclamation consortium is represented by residues derived from habitat maintenance. These residues are mainly formed by riparian vegetation that, from an energy point of view, can represent a renewable biomass. Some practical problems arise when passing from a theoretical approach to the development of an effective supply chain, the main of which is the biomass availability. Since the riparian ecosystem is characterized by a wide variety of landforms and biological communities, the functional supply chain must consider seasonal variability, different biomass composition depending on the land, and, hence, a mean biomass feedstock availability. The presented study has been conducted in a reclamation consortium of Northern Tuscany in Italy and examined the main characteristics of the feedstock and estimating its availability. This information has been used to propose different possible supply and utilization chains: a network of small-scale plants, biomass gasification involving external local utilizers or more complex scenarios dedicated to the production of syngas. Among the two final possible supply chains identified, gasification for syngas production and anaerobic digestion for biogas production, the first option resulted to be more profitable. The possible application to the consortium energy balance has been analyzed and commented, evidencing different technical factors that can influence its value.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Nowadays, Indonesian palm oil faces agrarian, environmental, and social issues and has been subject to sharp criticism from the international community for many years. To answer this problem, the Indonesian government implemented a strategy through certification which ensured the achievement of sustainability standards, especially on the upstream side of the palm oil supply chain. The implementation of Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) was an ultimate instrument that applied in particular to smallholders oriented towards managing land legal issues, plantation business licenses, plant seeds, and environmental management and to farmer organizations at the local level. However, this process faced quite complex challenges in the form of structural barriers that are very constraining. This study revealed the occurrence of the phenomenon of hollow governance when regulations are absent or collide with each other. The study also revealed institutional power and multi-level governance that made the governance process ineffective or counterproductive. With a qualitative approach to research conducted in three important palm oil provinces of Indonesia, this article aims to look at the issues of oil palm governance a bit more comprehensively. The study conceptualized what was referred to as low-functioning governance to describe how weak the institutions, organizations, actors, and resources are that support ISPO implementation, especially at the regional and local levels.

Environmental Technology and Innovation,"Nowadays, sustainability is one of the critical factors for the success of supply chains in organizations and firms that strive to maintain a competitive edge in the market. In wood industry, due to the need for integrating several business units such as forest entrepreneurs, carriers, pulp and paper mills and sawmills, such industries encounter various difficulties in maintaining effective supply chain collaborations. Literature on wood furniture industry seems to be lagging in terms of research on sustainable supply chain operations. To fill this gap, this study aims at identifying the critical factors that stand as a barrier between manufacturing and environmental sustainability in wood furniture industries. To achieve this aim, an integrated framework based on the triplet of Hierarchical Clustering, Analytical Hierarchy Process and Best-Worst Method has been proposed and implemented in a leading furniture manufacturer in UAE. The results show that waste management is the primary concern when an organization wants to pursue manufacturing environmental sustainability. Resources come in the second place where non-renewable resources should be substituted by renewable ones. The results were supported by a sensitivity analysis which confirms that higher attention should be directed to recycling of wood waste.

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Nowadays, the intensification of a competitive environment in markets in conjunction with sustainability issues has forced organizations to concentrate on designing sustainable closed-loop supply chains. In this study, a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network is configured under uncertain conditions based on fuzzy theory. The proposed network is a multi-product multi-period problem which is formulated by a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model with fuzzy demand and return rate. The objectives are to maximize the supply chain profit and customer satisfaction at the same time. Moreover, the carbon footprint is included in the first objective function in terms of cost (tax) to affect the total profit and treat the environmental aspect. Fuzzy linear programming and Lp-metric method are then applied to deal with the uncertainty and bi-objectiveness of the model, respectively. In order to validate the methodology, a case study problem in the dairy industry is investigated where the proposed Lp-metric is also compared to goal attainment method.

Frontiers in Nutrition,"Nowadays, the world has been characterized by hunger, obesity, and food loss and waste (FLW). With the COVID-19 pandemic, the food issue became more intense, serious, and evident. Hunger demands urgent actions. Obesity levels have been raised and are removing health and quality of life from the population. Production planting practices and the food supply chain are not necessarily ecologically friendly. Sustainability issues greatly intensify social problems. As well as food loss (FL), food waste (FW), and sustainability concerns, obesity, and malnutrition are enhanced due to the lack of knowledge by the population. Processed food (PF), packaging, and additives, despite still needing improvement, are essential to food security control. Nowadays, hunger is not due to insufficient agricultural practices but rather to inequality and absence of adequate public policies. In the context of a certain abundance of food production and processing, the hunger scenario in contrast to FLW is an ethical, social, moral, and sustainable issue. In this context, a Food-Based Dietary Guideline (FBDG) can be an important public policy tool from the health, nutrition, environmental, and educational points of view. Despite the effort, the literature shows that FBDGs can be better used to fulfill healthiness and sustainability purposes. In this scenario, the elaboration/revision of the FBDG, adopting a clearer, simpler, and a better-suited communication strategy is essential. In this way, this article discusses the importance of the FBDG as a public policy tool, not only regarding health issues but also communication strategies, production sustainability, and humanitarian ones, which are crucial to FBDG's efficiency.

The model set up a scoring procedure based on carbon emission avoidance, efficient resource exploitation and sustainability indexes. Applying the four levels of analysis (biomass availability, suitability analysis, regionalization and multi-criteria analysis), the cereal straw supply chains in four European districts (Scandinavian, Hanseatic, Central European and Mediterranean) have been identified and grouped in 18 biomass supply regional clusters (BSRCs). The clusters represent the most promising hotspots where biomass availability, logistics and feedstock requirements for a novel conversion technology meet. Central European and Mediterranean districts are those with the highest cereal straw bioeconomic potentials which allow mono-feedstock supply chains and relatively high capacity of a conversion technology at 200 MWth and beyond.

International Journal of Production Economics,"Nowadays, to achieve sustainable development, many developing countries are worrying about the deteriorating lock-in issues of high carbon. Therefore, policies including tax break, consumer green education, and subsidy for green production are set out to motivate multinational firms (MNFs) to build green factories in developing countries. This results in transboundary issues that induce MNFs' offshoring besides the traditional consideration of production cost. In this paper, we formulate the tradeoffs of an MNF headquartered in a developed country in building green factories overseas in developing countries that help the latter reshape urban infrastructure and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We show that the MNF's offshoring cost (e.g., the supply chain decentralization loss and the overseas delivery time cost) can be compensated by the tax-planning benefit because of the developing countries' tax break policies. We also show that the softened downstream market competition, improved consumer green awareness, and subsidy for green production serve as alternative weapons to encourage the MNFs to build green factories in developing countries.","Niu B., Zhang N., Xu H., Chen L., Ji P.",Inviting MNFs’ green offshoring: Is it an effective way to coordinate economic and environmental sustainability?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137274118&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108605&partnerID=40&md5=b292380f4d1995ac94ee7bf1e1fec29f

Journal of Environmental Quality,"Nutrient circularity can help supply chain participants meet sustainability targets. Across the segmented beef supply chain, opportunity exists to reinforce and introduce nutrient circularity by recycling surplus manure nutrients from cattle feedlots to lands where cattle feed is produced. We describe four datasets developed to evaluate options in U.S. and Canadian beef systems. The datasets delineate three “circular manuresheds,” each encompassing a hay-grazing landscape where beef cattle are raised on grazingland and supplemented with hay grown nearby, and the distant feedlots where those cattle produce manure nutrients for potential import back to the hayfields. We selected the hay-grazing landscapes of New Mexico, USA; Florida, USA; and western Canada (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia) because of their significant grazingland production and potential to substitute feedlot manure for commercial fertilizer on hayfields. In each circular manureshed, the manure nutrients from major feedlot destinations could supply a considerable proportion of the P used by hay for grazing cattle: 34% of the P requirements in New Mexico, 36% in Florida, and 6% in western Canada. The average distance to return the resource was 647 km for New Mexico, 1,884 km for Florida, and 1,587 km for western Canada. These magnitudes and distances suggest that the New Mexico circular manureshed may be the most economically viable in the current agri-food system, but this reflects only part of a greater, multi-factor assessment of tradeoffs. The circular manureshed concept provides a platform for simultaneous consideration of competing factors for sustainability via circularity.","Spiegal S., Vendramini J.M.B., Bittman S., Silveira M.L., Gifford C., Rotz C.A., Ragosta J.P., Kleinman P.J.A.",Recycling nutrients in the beef supply chain through circular manuresheds: Data to assess tradeoffs,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133642865&doi=10.1002%2fjeq2.20365&partnerID=40&md5=cb3863f98244ed57e9d79f297b87693d
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Olive oil is one of the most globally recognized high-value products, with 4 million hectares cultivated in the Mediterranean area. The production process involves many stages: farming, extraction, packing, and waste treatment. Each one of these stages should present critical points for the environmental impacts, and for this reason, the entire sector is adopting mitigation strategies to begin to be more sustainable. The mitigation actions’ efficiency should be evaluated through environmental indicators or environmental impact assessment by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This review aimed to carry out an overview of recent papers (2011–2021) involving an LCA study in the olive oil supply chain by giving a framework of what is included in LCA studies and highlighting the main contributors to environmental impacts. The main scholarly literature databases have been exploited, highlighting a great increase in publications, especially from the producer countries.

"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Omega-3 EPA and DHA fatty acids are vital for human health, but current human nutritional requirements are greater than supply. This nutrient gap is poised to increase as demand increases and the abundance of aquatic foods and the amount of omega-3 they contain may dwindle due to climate change and overfishing. Identifying and mitigating loss and inefficiencies across the global aquatic supply chain has great potential for narrowing this nutrient gap. Here, using an optimization model, we show that omega-3 supply to humans could potentially increase by as much as 50% (reaching 630 kt y−1) compared to present baseline by shifting feed inputs to produce species that have the highest omega-3 content per feed input (i.e. carp and crustaceans), diverting other production flows towards direct wild fish consumption, improving byproduct utilization, and reducing waste at the retail and consumer level. We then discuss the implications of our findings by prioritizing policies and identifying demand- and supply-side interventions to realize these ambitious changes. This work emphasizes the urgency needed in managing aquatic resources towards greater utilization of resources and highlights the extent to which even partial adaptation of the measures we propose can have on narrowing the present and future nutrient gap as novel alternative sources of omega-3 become available on a larger scale.","Shepon A., Makov T., Hamilton H.A., Müller D.B., Gephart J.A., Henriksson P.J.G., Troell M., Golden C.D.",Sustainable optimization of global aquatic omega-3 supply chain could substantially narrow the nutrient gap,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125641717&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2022.106260&partnerID=40&md5=543e45ff766ab4650c88a1be20d4db4a

Marine Policy,"One of the main challenges for improving the sustainability of value chain is that of understanding its function and mapping them, which implies the creation of a typology of actors and activities, to be used as a basis for analyses, generalisations and extrapolation. This work maps (i.e. thoroughly describes) the fisheries-based value chains in two contrasted countries in which these value chains are important activities for a large percentage of the population: The Gambia, where marine fisheries dominate, and Mali, where inland fisheries dominate. We explored, quantitatively and qualitatively, the geographical distribution, organisation, technical performance and exploited ecosystems associated with these value chains, as a means to facilitate their sustainability assessment. We applied an approach (Value Chain Analysis for Development) developed by policy makers and implemented by scientists within time constrains, in scarce data contexts, to monitor how development actions contribute to sustainable development goals. The challenges of mapping fisheries value chain are described and recommendations for improving both value chain assessments in general and the case study value chains in particular are proposed.","Acosta-Alba I., Nicolay G., Mbaye A., Dème M., Andres L., Oswald M., Zerbo H., Ndenn J., Avadí A.",Mapping fisheries value chains to facilitate their sustainability assessment: Case studies in The Gambia and Mali,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118842754&doi=10.1016%2fj.marpol.2021.104854&partnerID=40&md5=aed256670ea34af583006cf7640738a1
Sustainability (Switzerland),"One of the main concepts for improving the sustainability of supply chains is the collaboration between stakeholders by increasing the efficiency of their shared resources. In the literature, there are many research papers related to vertical collaboration in the logistics industry. However, horizontal collaboration has not received the same degree of attention. In fact, horizontal collaboration such as shared freight carrier and freight consolidation can also be considered vital for low-carbon supply chain solutions. In this paper, the problem of the design of supply chain transportation pooling strategies (SCTPS) is studied, which considers both vertical and horizontal collaboration. The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of these SCTPSs to reduce CO2 emissions using discrete-event simulation (DES)-based methodology. Using a numerical case study of two manufacturing companies and three customers, five SCTPS are studied including the following: (1) non-pooling strategy; (2) multi-pick strategy; (3) multi-drop strategy; (4) central hub strategy; and (5) combined hub and multi-drop strategy. The main result of the study is that all SCTPSs significantly reduce the CO2 emissions compared to the non-pooled supply chain. In fact, the reduction in CO2 emissions can reach 13% compared to the non-pooled strategy. Moreover, the best SCTPS that gives the minimum of CO2 is the hub strategy, followed by the multi-pick strategy and the multi-drop strategy.","Jerbi A., Jribi H., Aljuaid A.M., Hachicha W., Masmoudi F.",Design of Supply Chain Transportation Pooling Strategy for Reducing CO2 Emissions Using a Simulation-Based Methodology: A Case Study,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125074919&doi=10.3390%2fsu14042331&partnerID=40&md5=c9c60e6e9ab9f2b2cff9aed3a2f309c2
Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,"One of the profound impacts of digitalization on supply chains is manifested through e-commerce. The latter has significantly grown during the last two decades, with further amplifications during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created operational and policy making challenges for firms when deciding about how best to manage the resulting growth in e-commerce. While the impact of e-commerce on supply chains has been widely recognized in the literature, there was no effort to systematically review the literature, conceptualize some of the challenges and propose future research directions. This paper fills this gap by reviewing 153 publications from 1999 to 2019. We classify the reviewed literature based on which supply chain drivers were investigated, as well as, the employed research methodology. In addition, we conduct network and content analysis to uncover the main research themes and potential research directions namely, developing analytical centred; modelling based ecosystem for environment; leveraging data mining to enhance sustainability; balance between growth and sustainability; consumer demand and uncertainty; coordination in e-commerce logistics; last mile alternatives and cost management of innovative technique implementations. Furthermore, based on our literature review, we propose a conceptual framework where we interlink supply chain stages with a firm's business strategy, digital transformation strategy and performance.","Mashalah H.A., Hassini E., Gunasekaran A., Bhatt (Mishra) D.",The impact of digital transformation on supply chains through e-commerce: Literature review and a conceptual framework,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135292472&doi=10.1016%2fj.tre.2022.102837&partnerID=40&md5=648fd1278c3ed131f5be2c1c36b8c4b9
Membrane Engineering in the Circular Economy: Renewable Sources Valorization in Energy and Downstream Processing in Agro-food Industry,"One-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally, which amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year. Food loss and waste (FLW) causes serious social, economic, and environmental issues undermining our planet’s sustainability. Therefore actions aimed at FLW prevention and reduction must be urgently taken. The unsustainability of the current economic model, based on a linear system of production and consumption, has emerged above all in the food sector, where little is being done to upcycle residues generated along the supply chain. In this context the shift to a circular economy (CE) model applied to this sector has become urgent, to promote the transition to a more sustainable agro-food system, moving toward a zero-waste industry. Recently, scientific research is examining the adoption of CE models, thanks to the “Sustainable Development Goals” publication. In this chapter, a review of the literature focused on the CE approach along the whole food production chain was performed, highlighting its benefits, with the perspective of developing a closed-loop agri-food system. Finally, we look at the key role played by nonconventional membrane process technology that constitutes a promising tool for waste valorization through the recovery of high-added-value compounds.","Blasi A., Verardi A., Sangiorgio P.",The zero-waste economy: from food waste to industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138940902&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-323-85253-1.00006-X&partnerID=40&md5=00c09975dc5a7ec0e9ec1b0f5e64ba29
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Online sales and green investment are two important ways to improve the sustainability of the tourism supply chain under the pandemic. This research constructs an omni-channel tourism supply chain consists of two tourism service providers (i.e., TSPs) and one online travel agent (i.e., OTA). Tourism products are sold to consumers through three online sales channels, including two free channels and one bundled channel. The bundled channel is operated by the OTA, and the free channels can be operated by the TSPs or the OTA. Depending on the free channels operators, we depict four online selling models, i.e., the model where two free channels are operated by the two TSPs (TT model), the models where only one free channel is operated by one TSP (TO and OT models), and the model where two free channels are operated by the OTA (i.e., OO model). Through comparing the four models, we find that if the TSPs are responsible for green investment, model TT is the most profitable and greenest model compared to the other three models when the positive externality of greenness is high. Otherwise if the OTA is responsible for green investment, the profit and greening level of the tourism supply chain in model TT become the lowest. This study provides managerial insights for tourism practitioners to rationally operate tourism supply chain from three aspects: joint decisions of operations and greenness, channel structure design, and greening level improvement.","Li P., Xu S., Liu L.",Channel structure and greening in an omni-channel tourism supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138451149&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.134136&partnerID=40&md5=3849daf7441837bbdaeb21a82a7a3fe5

Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,"Operation and maintenance (O&M) is the last phase of Project Life Cycle (PLC) that focused on releasing the final deliverables to the customer and followed by the use of facilities and the maintenance of the whole building. This phase is the longest phase because it covers the entire lifetime of the building. The building that is operated and maintained using the green principles will contribute to sustainability by reducing energy and resource emissions by ensuring the building facilities’ durability and availability. Green Operation and Maintenance (GOM) programs as part of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) in the construction process consist of work implementation and control to conserve ‘green’ materials according to environmental needs in the project. GOM concept is important because O&M phase is the determinant of whether the building that have been initiated, designed and built with green processes can be maintained to keep contributing positively to the environment. To ensure that the O&M phase is run on the green principle, it is necessary to conduct a study to develop factors that can support the application of GSCM in the O&M phase. The aim of this study is to improve the GOM concept indicators as part of the GSCM construction.

Symmetry,"Optimization of logistics processes and activities in the function of supply‐chain sustainability is a great challenge for logistics companies. It is necessary to rationalize processes in accordance with the strict requirements of the market, while respecting aspects of sustainability, which is not an easy task. Multicriteria decision making can be a tool that contributes to the optimization of logistics processes in terms of making the right decisions and evaluating different strategies in different logistics subsystems. In this paper, we considered the warehousing system as one of the most important logistics subsystems in a company. Conditions and the possibility of implementing barcode technology in order to optimize warehousing processes were evaluated. We formed a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) matrix consisting of a total of 27 elements. In order to determine the weights of all factors at the first level of decision making and its indicators at the second level of the decision making hierarchy, an original model was developed. This model involved the creation of a novel grey full‐consistency method (FUCOM‐G) and integration with a SWOT analysis. Since it was a matter of group decision making, we developed a novel grey Hamy aggregator that, by adequately treating uncertainties and ambiguities, contributed to making more precise decisions. The original grey FUCOM‐SWOT model based on the grey Hamy aggregator represents a contribution to the entire field of decision making and optimization of logistics processes. Based on the applied model, the obtained results showed that Weaknesses, as part of the SWOT matrix, are currently the most dominant indicators, and that the implementation of barcode technology in a warehousing system is justified.","Popović V., Pamučar D., Stević Ž., Lukovac V., Jovković S.",Multicriteria Optimization of Logistics Processes Using a Grey FUCOM‐SWOT Model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129003056&doi=10.3390%2fsym14040794&partnerID=40&md5=c09448a9f5757dd671463dbd732e2acc
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Organizations are stimulated and informed by the consultants, competitors, and policymakers to develop their logistics strategies through the nexus of sustainability principles and digital intervention solutions. As the scholarly and managerial interests in sustainability and digital logistics technologies increase, there is an urgent requirement to expand the conceptual and implementation perspective. Sustainable logistics 4.0, yet in the nascent stage, is attracting the favourable attention of practitioners as it provides an opportunity to improve sustainability aspects of the business through digital intervention. In this study, fifteen enabling factors for implementing sustainable logistics 4.0 are identified and critically evaluated for varied firms on different digitalization stages. These factors are identified, prioritized, and modelled using critical literature review, experts' opinions, Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP), and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). The results show that “technology infrastructure, and digital solutions,” “top management commitment,” and “governmental norms” are found to be the top contributing factors influencing sustainable logistics 4.0 implementation.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"Organizations, while transforming resources into products and services and then into financial gains, consecutively neglect the adverse effects that are being caused to the environment and society. Hence, organizations should not focus on the financial aspects only; rather, they need to strive for business sustainability (BS). For an organization to become more sustainable, they need to tap and excel into green innovation (GIN), followed by green intellectual capital (GIC), whereas the role of green supply chain management practices (GSCMP) in this objective cannot be ignored. To fill this gap, we have established a framework based on the natural resource-based view theory and extant literature that offers a foundation for sculpturing the process by which GIN was observed to capture BS through GIC and GSCMP. Primary data were collected from the Malaysian manufacturing industries, and partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied to the sample of 243 respondents. The key findings reported that GIN has a positive and significant relationship with GIC, GSCMP, and BS. Further, GIC and GSCMP also positively and significantly affect BS. These findings have some certain recommendations for policymakers that the present study proposed. Mainly organizations need to develop their green and sustainable resources, which will help them develop according to the principles of BS and gain a competitive advantage in the long run. In the end, there are certain limitations of the present study on which the possibilities of future research are drawn.","Suki N.M., Suki N.M., Sharif A., Afshan S., Rexhepi G.",Importance of green innovation for business sustainability: Identifying the key role of green intellectual capital and green SCM,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134026334&doi=10.1002%2fbse.3204&partnerID=40&md5=0e92f2dab6e9eb920c420448d370aa67
Horticulturae,"Ornamentals are the most diversified products and fast-changing industry of horticulture. A new flower and ornamental plant market scenario is developing: remarkable opportunities are emerging, but more efforts are required by both public and private stakeholders to seize them and assure a high-value positioning.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Over a million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute, 20,000 every second. While there is agreement that single-use plastics should be phased out, records of plastic pollution point in the opposite direction. Until the phasing-out of single-use plastics materialises, there is an immediate opportunity to mitigate the environmental impacts of plastic use through better design, that is to improve material efficiency without affecting function or performance. In this article, we focus on a standard plastic milk bottle, which we redesign based on a previously developed shape factor for the sustainability of forms, achieving a ∼13% material reduction. Environmental benefits are evaluated globally through hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA) both in the 10 countries in which the original plastic bottle is used and the other 22 countries upstream in the supply chain. Results obtained through hybrid LCA are 17.3% higher than those obtained through process-based LCA. Environmental benefits arising in the 22 countries in the upstream supply chain are twice as much as those observed in the 10 countries where the original bottle is used. Overall, our findings show a potential annual reduction of ∼1.9 Mt CO2e, equivalent to approximately 415,000 cars taken off the road, thus proving the substantial and viable benefits that can be achieved by material efficiency through redesign.","Pomponi F., Li M., Saint R., Lenzen M., D'Amico B.",Environmental benefits of material-efficient design: A hybrid life cycle assessment of a plastic milk bottle,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123934492&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.01.028&partnerID=40&md5=2c67a6c0fa417423149a05efb134ab27

Lecture Notes in Logistics,"Over the last couple of years, there has been an increase in reciprocal discussion within the fields of supply chain resilience (SCRES) and sustainability (SSCM). Although some thematic overlap has been noted, SCRES and SSCM are generally still considered to be two separate domains. However current global SC events and legislative initiatives demonstrate why it is important to view SCRES and SSCM in combination to solve the problem of long-term supply chain risks and disruptions. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether SCRES and SSCM can be integrated, which overlapping elements need to be considered and which main congruent capabilities exist. The exploratory study applies a citation network and main path analysis based on a dataset of two previously conducted systematic literature reviews. The literature review revealed great potential for combining the two research domains based on four identified connecting elements - supply chain capabilities, practices, risks and performance. We also identified great potential for the application of two main congruent capabilities - transparency and big data analytics. The four elements identified provide us with a useful basis for creating a theoretical framework for integrating SSCM and SCRES.

Sustainable Development,"Over the last decade, supply chain finance (SCF) has gained popularity and increasing attention among academicians and stakeholders in the context of financial flows in the supply chain. However, some research gaps still exist that need to be explored to improve the sustainability of supply chains. Specifically, there is a critical research need to look at the conceptual background of SCF and its potential applicability in various phases of supply chains. Therefore, this article aims to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive State-of-the-Art literature review based on 367 papers published from 2006 to 2020. Furthermore, this article is one of the first attempts to present current and past studies in the domain of SCF in a holistic manner. The analysis highlights the most influential authors, keywords, organisations, leading publications and clusters in existing research areas. This article also sets out a proposed research framework based on the triangulation approach perspective, that is, financial perspective, buyer perspective and supply chain-oriented perspective. The most important and unique contribution of the article is the identification of new and emerging research areas where the application of SCF is still in the nascent stage.

Marine Policy,"Over the last two decades, efforts to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing have led to an expansion of initiatives to enhance transparency across the seafood industry through international agreements, national government regulations, and voluntary private initiatives. Understanding of the effects of these initiatives remains limited, and approaches contested among stakeholders. Yet similar transparency initiatives introduced in recent decades across other sectors whose goal is to expand sustainability in global supply chains, may offer applicable lessons for seafood sustainability. Through a comparative review of transparency initiatives adopted in apparel, extractives, and timber supply chains, this study draws out lessons to inform efforts to expand transparency in seafood supply chains in order to combat illegal fishing. Across the literature reviewed on these three industries and seafood, there was mixed consensus that the initiatives met their intended sustainability goals or significantly affected costs and revenues, based on the evidence available. The review finds a trend across the three industries for increased transparency initiatives in international supply chains, which are often voluntary or state-based initiatives. This trend was commonly motivated by expanded trade and reputational risks from consumer demand, and external pressure from civil society. Transparency initiatives were often driven by governments, lead firms, and markets from developed countries. Conversely the resources and/or producers targeted by the transparency activities have been more widely dispersed worldwide, with many located in developing countries. Comparing across the sectors, lessons learned are distilled to inform efforts aiming to expand transparency in seafood supply chains.","Virdin J., Vegh T., Ratcliff B., Yozell S., Havice E., Daly J., Stuart J.","Combatting illegal fishing through transparency initiatives: Lessons learned from comparative analysis of transparency initiatives in seafood, apparel, extractive, and timber supply chains",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124533490&doi=10.1016%2fj.marpol.2022.104984&partnerID=40&md5=f7dd667cd8326094353d53983eec313d
JPhys Materials,"Over the past 150 years, our ability to produce and transform engineered materials has been responsible for our current high standards of living, especially in developed economies. However, we must carefully think of the effects our addiction to creating and using materials at this fast rate will have on the future generations. The way we currently make and use materials detrimentally affects the planet Earth, creating many severe environmental problems. It affects the next generations by putting in danger the future of the economy, energy, and climate. We are at the point where something must drastically change, and it must change now. We must create more sustainable materials alternatives using natural raw materials and inspiration from nature while making sure not to deplete important resources, i.e. in competition with the food chain supply. We must use less materials, eliminate the use of toxic materials and create a circular materials economy where reuse and recycle are priorities. We must develop sustainable methods for materials recycling and encourage design for disassembly. We must look across the whole materials life cycle from raw resources till end of life and apply thorough life cycle assessments (LCAs) based on reliable and relevant data to quantify sustainability. We need to seriously start thinking of where our future materials will come from and how could we track them, given that we are confronted with resource scarcity and geographical constrains. This is particularly important for the development of new and sustainable energy technologies, key to our transition to net zero. Currently ‘critical materials’ are central components of sustainable energy systems because they are the best performing. A few examples include the permanent magnets based on rare earth metals (Dy, Nd, Pr) used in wind turbines, Li and Co in Li-ion batteries, Pt and Ir in fuel cells and electrolysers, Si in solar cells just to mention a few. These materials are classified as ‘critical’ by the European Union and Department of Energy. Except in sustainable energy, materials are also key components in packaging, construction, and textile industry along with many other industrial sectors. This roadmap authored by prominent researchers working across disciplines in the very important field of sustainable materials is intended to highlight the outstanding issues that must be addressed and provide an insight into the pathways towards solving them adopted by the sustainable materials community. In compiling this roadmap, we hope to aid the development of the wider sustainable materials research community, providing a guide for academia, industry, government, and funding agencies in this critically important and rapidly developing research space which is key to future sustainability.","Titirici M., Baird S.G., Sparks T.D., Yang S.M., Brandt-Talbot A., Hosseinaei O., Harper D.P., Parker R.M., Vignolini S., Berglund L.A., Li Y., Gao H.-L., Mao L.-B., Yu S.-H., Díez N., Ferrero G.A., Sevilla M., Szilágyi P.i., Stubbs C.J., Worch J.C., Huang Y., Luscombe C.K., Lee K.-Y., Luo H., Platts M.J., Tiwari D., Kovalevskiy D., Fermin D.J., Au H., Alptekin H., Crespo-Ribadeneyra M., Ting V.P., Fellinger T.-P., Barrio J., Westhead O., Roy C., Stephens I.E.L., Nicolae S.A., Sarma S.C., Oates R.P., Wang C.-G., Li Z., Loh X.J., Myers R.J., Heeren N., Grégoire A., Périssé C., Zhao X., Vodovotz Y., Earley B., Finnveden G., Björklund A., Harper G.D.J., Walton A., Anderson P.A.",The sustainable materials roadmap,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135706257&doi=10.1088%2f2515-7639%2fac4ee5&partnerID=40&md5=f0e4822eb4ea1e6a747b38faae971ccf
World Development,"Over the past decade public and private actors have been developing a variety of new policy approaches for addressing agriculturally-driven deforestation linked to international supply chains. While payments for environmental services (PES) have been advocated in many contexts as an efficient and pro-poor environmental policy to incentivize conservation, they have been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism for leading to mixed and sometimes adverse environmental and social outcomes. It remains unclear whether such an approach is an improvement over existing approaches to govern sustainability in supply chains and especially as a mechanism for reducing ecosystem conversion. Here we conduct an ex-ante analysis to examine the potential outcomes of using a standalone PES scheme versus existing standalone market exclusion mechanisms (MEM) to govern commodity supply chains. The analysis develops a theoretical framework to examine the potential effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity, and legitimacy of the two approaches and then applies this framework using qualitative analysis of secondary and interview data. Using this theory-driven evaluation approach we examine the case of the Brazilian Cerrado, where a PES mechanism is currently being proposed to achieve zero-deforestation targets in soy supply chains. We find that both standalone approaches suffer from different strengths and challenges and would be better used in combination. We conclude that a mixture of strict market exclusion with positive incentives and enabling programs that are targeted at the poorest farmers would be more effective, cost-effective, equitable, and legitimate. However, in the future such supply chain focused soy deforestation control efforts in the Cerrado must be complemented by broader jurisdictional approaches to addressing deforestation and sustainable developement that include all land use actors, not just soy farmers. These more inclusive and balanced initiatives can help ensure that avoiding deforestation goes hand in hand with supporting sustainable livelihoods for a wider range of actors in the Cerrado.","Garrett R.D., Grabs J., Cammelli F., Gollnow F., Levy S.A.",Should payments for environmental services be used to implement zero-deforestation supply chain policies?

Environmental Science and Policy,"Over the past decade, debates on the governance of food, water, and energy resources (FWE nexus) have increased, provoking new insights into social importance in ecological balance. Policymakers, management professionals, and scholars of the FWE nexus call for new approaches that address ranges of social and ecological impacts of uncoordinated sectoral planning. From a theoretical perspective, social-ecological systems (SES) science offers a balanced approach for improved FWE nexus through consolidating knowledge from a wide range of disciplines and providing the opportunity to adapt to the changing environment. However, although increasingly employed, it has been complicated to empirically monitor and evaluate the dynamic social-ecological nexus systems. A framework for translating SES theory into FWE nexus practice is needed. This paper develops an integrated assessment framework of the social-ecological nexus systems governance and presents results from its application to a Dutch smart-eco city. An integrative multi-level analysis scheme is used to analyze intra- and inter- relationships, quantify social and ecological impacts of uncoordinated FWE management, and visualize FWE supply-chain risks posed to cities by the dynamic humans and nature interactions. The evidence-based approach of this study proved advantages of the proposed framework in (i) revealing connections of natural resources and the cultural, regulating, and supporting services of nexus systems, and (ii) making practical recommendations for improved socio-ecologically-balanced nexus interventions. The results can support policymakers and management professionals of the FWE nexus to organize their analytical, diagnostic, and prescriptive capabilities to make development decisions on urban resilience and ecological balance.","Ghodsvali M., Dane G., de Vries B.",The nexus social-ecological system framework (NexSESF): A conceptual and empirical examination of transdisciplinary food-water-energy nexus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123055552&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2022.01.010&partnerID=40&md5=388e4b00caeac8759e07ef859d173379
Operations Management Research,"Over the past decade, there has been a constant spotlight on introducing sustainability in the supply chain (SC). The materialistic human greed for production and consumption has led to a radically increased level of greenhouse gases. SC has become its principal contributor. We are addressing this socio-economic environmental challenge by developing a multi-stakeholder framework and focusing on a knowledge-based net zero supply chain, as there are no concrete existing studies that have investigated current state-of-the-art operations in this relevant field. Therefore, this research has been conducted to investigate the drivers, barriers and practices through which net zero economy (NZE) can be attained in a knowledge-based SC. In this regard, the paper conducts an exploratory systematic review of selected articles from peer-reviewed journals. The findings indicate that primary stakeholders (i.e. organisations and suppliers) require to take an active role in bringing about sustainable changes in practice. However, external perspectives (i.e. government, society, consumers and community) have also been identified as sources that create challenges as well as have the potential to aid sustainable industrial practices. Additionally, progress can be enhanced through proper policies, regulations and a knowledge-based conceptual framework to pave the way for a sustainable environment. Proper practices for NZE also provide scope for economic growth through cost-effective production. This paper will be beneficial for practitioners as well as policy makers on a global scale who aim to attain NZE for sustainability.","Singh J., Pandey K.K., Kumar A., Naz F., Luthra S.","Drivers, barriers and practices of net zero economy: An exploratory knowledge based supply chain multi-stakeholder perspective framework",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128822513&doi=10.1007%2fs12063-022-00255-x&partnerID=40&md5=944ea882f819f1839625a612cc21da07
Applied Physics Reviews,"Over the past few decades, Bombyx mori silk fibroin has become a ubiquitous material for applications ranging from biomedical devices to optics, electronics, and sensing, while also showing potential in the food supply chain and being re-engineered as a functional material for architecture and design-related applications. Its widespread use derives from its unique properties, including biocompatibility, edibility, optical transparency, stabilization of labile compounds, and the ability to controllably change conformation and degrade in a programmed way. This review discusses recent and pivotal silk-based devices in which the presence of silk brings added value in terms of functionality, as demonstrated in a broad variety of fields. First, it gives an overview of silk's natural structure and main properties in terms of cross-linking, biocompatibility, and biodegradability to provide the reader with the necessary toolbox to fully make use of silk's multifaceted properties. Then, multifunctional silk-based devices are discussed highlighting the advantage of using silk over more traditional materials.

International Journal of Production Research,"Over the past few years, supply chains have become globalised and multi-tiered. These factors complicate their structure as the focal company is responsible for the problems experienced at each stage in the multi-tier supply chain. The critical issue for focal companies in managing their multi-tier supply chain is to adopt sustainability standards. One of the study's contributions is the role of weight determination in the tiers and evaluation of alternative suppliers in facilitating the effective management of multi-tier supply chains, especially in complex industries such as the food industry. The other contribution of this study is its proposition for a multi-stage framework based on sustainability concerns. The study identifies 14 criteria for companies in diffusing sustainability standards throughout multi-tier supply chains. The weights of these criteria are determined for each tier of the food supply chain using the Best Worst Method. Results show that the ‘environmental’ criteria are most important for supply chain tiers in the food industry. Supply chain visibility/traceability is the most important criteria for the first tier, followed by environmental responsibilities, for the second and environmental competencies for the third.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Over the years, the global supply chain has evolved into a more extensive interconnected complex network with multiple suppliers, manufacturers, and customers. Since environmental issues have become a burning question in recent years, the focus has shifted to attaining sustainability in supply chain management. The green supply chain or sustainable network is a concept to reduce environmental impacts in the life cycle of a product. However, green supply chain management is often challenged with additional operating costs and difficulty monitoring the implications within the complex network system. Additionally, many stakeholders are unaware of the importance of sustainability analysis, which eventually complicates adopting green cultures in actual applications. Since green supply chain management deals with multiple aspects, such as cost and carbon emission, the multiobjective optimization method is widely used to evaluate supply chain performance. This paper intensively reviews the state-of-the-art literature on applying multiobjective optimization techniques in green supply chain management. The study highlights aspects of green supply chain structures, model formulation techniques considering multiple objectives simultaneously, and solution methods for multiobjective optimization problems. Finally, a conclusion is drawn with the scope of the potential research opportunities for integrating economic and environmental considerations in sustainable supply chain management practice.","Asha L.N., Dey A., Yodo N., Aragon L.G.",Optimization Approaches for Multiple Conflicting Objectives in Sustainable Green Supply Chain Management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139978033&doi=10.3390%2fsu141912790&partnerID=40&md5=d01dd023921a04345cee326376e7b2f9
Energies,"Over the years, the innovation and development of electrical and electronic equipment have been on a steep rise. Millions of electronics are being sold or discarded every year in the form of waste. Sustainable IT (Green IT or Circular Computing) is one of the most environment-friendly methods of reusing discarded or waste user electronics. The remanufacturing of a computer refers to the disassembly, repair, and upgrade of the original computer to give it a new life, along with a warranty that is as good as a new product. The goal of this work includes studying and assessing the total environmental impact of refurbishing a computer using life cycle assessment (LCA) integrated with discrete event simulation (DES), to compare two business models: (1) a case of centralized remanufac-turing where the plants are in the Middle East, which is the hub for receiving waste electronics and distributing remanufactured goods; (2) a case of decentralized remanufacturing where the plants are situated in each continent for over a range of computer models. The environmental assessment was conducted using the openLCA software in combination with the WITNESS Horizon software for the DES. The results show that decentralized remanufacturing is a much more environmentally friendly option for the remanufacturing of computers, and the decentralized remanufacturing operation has a better throughput as well as efficiency, as compared to the centralized remanufacturing operation. The centralized remanufacturing scenario has a climate change impact of 1035.19 kg of CO2-Eq, as compared to the decentralized remanufacturing scenario with an impact of 816.12 kg of CO2-Eq. In terms of the impact on the marine life, decentralized remanufacturing was found to have 0.28 kg of N-Eq impact, as compared to centralized remanufacturing (0.22 kg of N-Eq). However, this does not give us a complete picture, as the environmental impact of the computer in its previous life remains unknown. Multi life cycle assessment is the assessment process that can be used to get a clearer picture of the ecological footprint of the computer during its multiple life cycles.","Mann A., Saxena P., Almanei M., Okorie O., Salonitis K.",Environmental Impact Assessment of Different Strategies for the Remanufacturing of User Electronics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127405159&doi=10.3390%2fen15072376&partnerID=40&md5=7be33b14bdbea1d52b02ecdb87edb6bc
Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition,"Packaging ensures the safe handling and distribution of fresh and processed food products via diverse supply chains, and has become an indispensable component of the food industry. However, the rapidly expanding use of plastics, especially single-use plastics, as packaging material leads to inadequate waste management, littering, and consequently serious environmental damage, which predominantly affects marine and freshwater sources. Thus, the use of plastics for packaging purposes has become a major public concern and hence a concern among global policymakers. Notably, 26% of the total volume of global plastic production is primarily used for packaging, of which single-use plastics account for 50%, resulting in pollution that may last hundreds of years. This review provides an overview of the manner in which molded pulp products can be utilized to improve sustainability of food packaging applications, by highlighting the manufacturing processes, signifying characteristics features of recyclable molded pulp, and coupling circularity with eco-friendly and safe food product packaging. In this regard, current concepts advocate the implementation of a dynamic and sustainable approach using molded pulp products. This approach encompasses the design and production of eco-friendly packaging, distribution and consumption of packaged products, and collection and recycling of used packaging for subsequent reuse.","Singh A.K., Itkor P., Lee M., Shin J., Lee Y.S.",Promoting sustainable packaging applications in the circular economy by exploring and advancing molded pulp materials for food products: a review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131855643&doi=10.1080%2f10408398.2022.2088686&partnerID=40&md5=fc50f60e517fd310df7838ea8ac874dd
Journal of Oil Palm Research,"Palm oil is the leading vegetable oil in terms of volume in the world market. Indonesia and Malaysia are the top producers and exporters of the commodity. The global production of palm oil reached 73.5 million tonnes in the period 2018/2019, up from approximately 70.5 million tonnes in 2017/2018. Oil palm is the most productive crop in the world being 10 times more productive than soybean which produces only about 0.45 t oil per hectare. Nonetheless, the industry is continuously under pressure to improve productivity and sustainability. This will require concerted innovations across the entire palm oil supply chain and fully committed research efforts including upstream technologies to expedite crop improvement. At the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), research efforts at development of tools for improving oil palm traits by genetic modification have been augmented more recently with omics-based approaches and all of these innovations are synchronised towards improved product quality. Omics is a multi-disciplinary field encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Each of these fields provides an opportunity to understand and view oil palm biology from a global perspective, enabling accelerated discoveries for improved productivity and the development of new and improved varieties. An integrative omics approach promises great value in both phenotyping and diagnostic analyses. With the current technological capabilities, metabolomics is also being exploited for identifying unique chemical fingerprints to detect product contamination and adulteration in oil palm. This effort is actively being conducted in order to position the oil palm industry to meet and optimise the delivery of the highest quality oil with minimum environmental and social concerns. In this review, an overview is given on the current knowledge and progress made in oil palm research, focusing on the application of omics strategies and their integration with high-throughput technologies for oil palm crop improvement, development of geographical traceability system and ensuring that palm oil is free from residual oil contamination.","Ramli U.S., Othman A., Chung B.L.Y., Hassan H., Ishak N.A.M., Nurazah Z., Rozali N.L., Tahir N.I.M., Shahwan S., Dzulkafli S.B., Singh R., Rasid O.A.B.D., Sambanthamurthi R., Manaf M.A.A., Parveez G.K.A.",OMICS PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES FOR DISCOVERY AND UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEMS BIOLOGY OF OIL PALM,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129554640&doi=10.21894%2fjopr.2020.0084&partnerID=40&md5=1def6950136d1282c7b8b37906f32eb4
International Journal of Production Economics,"Palm oil supply chains are complex and controversial due to claims that they follow unsustainable practices in operation and production process, which causes massive environmental pollution. However, this claim is not strong enough to generalize the whole industry as unsustainable. Indeed, the palm oil industry seems to be pursuing Industry-4.0-technologies and circular-economy-practices to improve its unsustainable practices. This study endeavours to overcome the shortcomings in the palm oil industry that is fragmented and unclear. This study develops a structural literature review published in 2011–2021. This study presents a conceptualization framework through four cluster groups (1) industry-4.0-in-a-circular-economy application; (2) sustainability practices; (3) sustainability performance; and (4) moderating factors. Subsequently, the present study develops nine propositions from these concepts due to descriptive and content analyses. Then, the study theorizes that industry-4.0-in-a-circular-economy application has a quasi-effect on sustainability performance, and sustainability practices may act as a mediator in this relationship and a moderating factor that may influence the above relationship.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Para rubber feedstock production potential was explored in Hat Yai district. The study focused on the respondent’s socioeconomic status, feedstock production potential, and mapped the relevant actors along the supply chain. Structured questionnaires were administered to 117 respondents chosen through random and purposeful sampling. The descriptive statistics, linear regression models, feedstock potential model, and Simpson’s diversity index were used to analyze the data. The findings showed average ages of 54.4 and 48.4 for farmers and processors respectively, with above 40% literacy. Seventy-six percent of the plantations’ land belongs to the respondents with corresponding average yields of 9.5 tons/yr and 1082.5 logs for latex and parawood as the main products. Farmers and processors had a mean annual para rubber income of USD 6341.35 and 2.55 million USD, respectively. The analysis revealed a significant relationship between plantation size and feedstock supply; the theoretical feedstock potential is 831,630.91 tons and is highly diverse (Simpson’s diversity index of 0.75), indicative of high potential for sustainable production and consumption.

Agronomy for Sustainable Development,"Pastoral systems face increasing pressure from competing global markets, food sector industrialization, and new policies such as Europe’s post-2020 Common Agriculture Policy. This pressure threatens the use of extensive sheep-grazing systems in mountain areas of low productivity but high natural value. Using information gathered at a long-term research setting in a mountainous area of the Basque Country (northern Spain), we assessed the multiple benefits of extensive dairy sheep grazing systems from multiple perspectives using indicators pertaining to ecological, socio-economic, and food quality domains. In this way, we address the benefits that would be lost if sheep grazing abandonment persists in mountain regions. Our results show that the benefits of extensive dairy sheep grazing in the research area include the production of healthy and high-quality foods and multiple ecological benefits including biodiversity conservation. Extensive dairy sheep grazing also contributes to rural development by generating employment and income in marginal, low-productivity lands that can support few economic alternatives. In particular, we found that sheep farmers who produce high-value products, such as cheese, have enhanced their economic profitability and are less dependent on public subsidies. However, careful attention to sustainable practices, support for new generations of farmers, and streamlined supply chains are required. These would contribute to ensure socio-economic benefits for farmers, avoid the ecological costs associated with grazing abandonment, and enhance ecosystem services for the whole society.","Garmendia E., Aldezabal A., Galan E., Andonegi A., del Prado A., Gamboa G., Garcia O., Pardo G., Aldai N., Barron L.J.R.","Mountain sheep grazing systems provide multiple ecological, socio-economic, and food quality benefits",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131089436&doi=10.1007%2fs13593-021-00751-7&partnerID=40&md5=3631ed62ffaa150e462cef51162c5241
Journal of Environmental Management,"Pastureland used for livestock grazing is globally much bigger than arable land. This study investigates the pastureland use embedded in global supply chains by using multi-regional systems input-output anlysis, tracing embodied pastureland use from source of exploitation to sink of final consumption in the global economy. The world's pastureland resources is shown reallocated through the supply chain mainly to the four major economies: EU, the United States, China, and Japan. These four economies are responsible for driving more than half of the global pastureland exploitation. Major supply chains responsible for the global reallocation of pastureland use include the cattle supply chain from Other Asia & Pacific to the United States, China, and Japan, and the cattle supply chain from Africa to EU and the Middle East. This paper demonstrates the nature and scale of the global reallocation of pastureland resources through the supply chain, highlighting the fact that the global shift of pastureland use from nature-based to economic-based may exacerbate ecological inequity between world regions. It is proposed that future policies and regulations should encourage sustainability goals not only on a regional level but on a global scale, finding pathways to sustainable and equitable livestock production by inter-regional collaboration.","Li C., Wu X., Chen K., Chen G.",Global pastureland use as reflected in inter-regional supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138443175&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.116016&partnerID=40&md5=687d10b5851fbc665dbd005d118fef6e
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Performance measures are vital in assessing the disaster relief operations and mitigate the losses that occur during disaster.

The outcome of this research reveals that “beneficiaries’ and donors’ perspectives” is the most significant HSCM performance perspectives. The findings help to identify the relative importance of each performance measure for performance evaluation of HOs. The proposed framework can help HOs on the aspects of performance improvement relevant to both donors and beneficiaries group that facilitates stakeholders in the benchmarking and network design of HOs. This study explores the SBSC in HSCM to analyze the performance measures and evaluate the performance of HOs that enable an integrated performance measurement system. HOs monitored their logistics performance effectively, which further lead to process improvement for betterment.","Agarwal S., Kant R., Shankar R.",Exploring sustainability balanced scorecard for performance evaluation of humanitarian organizations,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131442314&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2021.100026&partnerID=40&md5=4cb0031a4eec9efae4c27e7ef30decee
Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments,"Perishable goods like fresh produce are growing part of today's e-commerce projects. Due to their perishable nature, traditionally they have accounted for a high share in the inventory cost management. In current pandemic times, when all the business are suffering, inventory control becomes all the more important for a sustainable environment. There is a need of calculated buying and selling of products as the supply chain has effected in a major way. Aiming at the cost control problem for these enterprises, this paper proposes use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques for the inventory management of perishable goods. The paper models the retailers inventory limitation factors and also models real-world parameters like overdue cost, shortage cost, lead time and corruption costs across multiple products. The simulation experiments show that the proposed RL models are able to reduce inventory cost and spoilage rate of the goods when the products lead times and life cycles are known along with the distribution of the demand of the products.","Selukar M., Jain P., Kumar T.",Inventory control of multiple perishable goods using deep reinforcement learning for sustainable environment,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126816281&doi=10.1016%2fj.seta.2022.102038&partnerID=40&md5=66d59d519b69e622fb88b17b82be3ebc
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Perishable goods, such as chilled and frozen foods, have a short shelf life and high sensitivity to their surrounding environment (e.g., temperature, humidity, and light intensity). For this reason, they must be distributed within a specific time and require special equipment and facilities (e.g., refrigeration and dehumidification systems) throughout the entire chain from farm to fork to ensure slow deterioration and to deliver safe and high-quality products to consumers. Cold chains can last for short periods, such as a few hours, or for several months or even years (e.g., frozen food products) depending on the product and the target market. A huge amount of energy is required to preserve quality by maintaining the desired temperature level over time. The required energy is also affected by inventory management policies (e.g., warehouse filling levels affect the cooling demand per unit of a product) and the behavior of the operators (e.g., number and duration of door openings). Furthermore, waste entails the loss of energy and other resources consumed for processing and storing these products. The aim of the present study is to propose a quantitative approach in order to map the energy flows throughout the cold chain in the food and beverage sector and to evaluate the overall energy performance. The results of the energy flow mapping give decisionmakers insights into the minimum energy required by the cold chain and allow them to prioritize energy efficiency measures by detecting the most energy consuming stages of the cold chain. The implementation of a holistic approach, shifting from a single-company perspective to chain assessment, leads to a global optimum and to an increased implementation rate of energy efficiency measures due to the reduced barriers perceived by different actors of the cold chain.","Marchi B., Zanoni S.",Cold Chain Energy Analysis for Sustainable Food and Beverage Supply,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138935688&doi=10.3390%2fsu141811137&partnerID=40&md5=2d47e3a9cfcf17662c830f5cf314acc5
Open Agriculture,"Peruvian regions for sugarcane planting produce sugarcanes throughout the year with a high average productivity. The objective of this article is to analyze the role of agents in the sugarcane supply chain to Peruvian mills and their relationship with the practice of agrarian contracts to sugarcane production. The perception of landowners and farmers about bioenergy and their predisposition to plant energy crops is also investigated. Field interviews are conducted with the main agents of the sugarcane production chain in the major producing regions. Statistical analysis of data from field interviews indicates that the relationship between owners and sugarcane producers is of land leasing. Intermediate agents act as a fundamental part of the sugarcane supply chain. The sharecropping or sugarcane purchase contract is an instrument that is established between middlemen and small independent producers, whether they are owners or tenants. The middlemen participation in commercialization can reach 30-40% of the sugarcane production. Most mills prefer to produce sugarcane in own lands. A relatively high degree of inequity in favor of the middlemen appears in the intermediation process because, in general, the mills prefer this intermediation in their commercial practice. A large number of landowners and tenants are familiar with notions of energy crops, particularly in relation to sugarcane and have a positive vision about them for the environmental sustainability. However, their interest in planting bioenergy crops is less. Friendly and equitable relations between agents will provide more economic and social stability to the Peruvian sugarcane agroindustry.","De Almeida P.J., Salinas C.T., Pérez-Huiman Ó.J., Watanabe R.R.R., Marcelo-Aldana D.","Agrarian contracts, relations between agents, and perception on energy crops in the sugarcane supply chain: The Peruvian case",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135615786&doi=10.1515%2fopag-2022-0112&partnerID=40&md5=85673d23c30ec0fb086bf257325e3e80
Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,"Pharmaceutical supply chains tend to be complex, and its management encounters several challenges. In this work, a decision-support tool based on a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is proposed, aiming to integrate several strategical-tactical decisions while considering the three pillars of sustainability, which are addressed as objective functions. The economic assessment is performed through the Net Present Value (NPV). The environmental impact assessment follows the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) methodology. Accessibility of pharmaceutical products is the major focus for the social assessment, aiming to provide an equal distribution based on the burden of diseases which is made through a DALY-based metric (Disability-Adjusted Life Year).

Resources,"Phasing out fossil fuels to renewables is currently a global priority due to the climate change threat. Advocacy for biomass use as an energy source requires assessing the quality biomass and ecological impacts of bioenergy supply chains. This study evaluated the quality of biomass residues from orchards and silviculture transported from different Northern and Central Italy locations and the carbon footprint of a biomass power plant. The total greenhouse emissions were calculated based on primary data for 2017 according to the ISO/TS 14067. All the residue samples showed their suitability for biofuel use. Ash content was relatively low on average (3–5% d.m.), except for grapevine residues (18% d.m.). The lower heating value was within the expected range of 15–21 MJ kg−1 for plant species. The average GHG emission from the power plant was 17.4 g CO2 eq./MJ of electrical energy, with the energy conversion (38%) and transportation of biomass (34%) phases being the main impact contributors. For this study, impacts of residual agricultural residue were about half that of residues from forest management, mainly due to chipping and greater transport distance. Results show that sourcing residual biomass materials for electricity generation close to power plants significantly reduce GHG emissions compared to conventional fossil fuels.","Ilari A., Duca D., Boakye-Yiadom K.A., Gasperini T., Toscano G.",Carbon Footprint and Feedstock Quality of a Real Biomass Power Plant Fed with Forestry and Agricultural Residues,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123263190&doi=10.3390%2fresources11020007&partnerID=40&md5=3e460eca14e7e04113d3799ba4ca3789
International Journal of Production Economics,"Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost.

Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,"Pooling is one of the innovative solutions to improve the sustainability of supply chain. However, each pooling solution is unique in terms of its organization, flows and geographical locations. This paper presents a simulation study for a pooled supply chain with multiple suppliers and customers. Contrary to the literature, this study was not limited to a single pooling strategy. Indeed, the four pooling strategies, multi-pick, multi-drop, with hub and hybridization of hub and multi-drop strategies were considered. The main aim of this study is to explore the effects these pooling strategies on the supply chain’s total CO2 emissions through simulation models. The simulation models are developed with the ARENA software and used in a case study. In this case, a two companies and three clients pooled supply chain is simulated. The main outcome from the investigation of the impact of pooling strategies on the CO2 emissions of this pooled supply chain results is that all the supply chain pooling strategies outperform the non-pooled supply chains. Indeed, the four studied scenarios showed much lower CO2 emissions than the non pooled one. From another side, it appears that the pooling hub strategy with multi-drop delivery strategy shows the best results.","Jerbi A., Jribi H., Masmoudi F.",Comparison of the Impact of Different Pooling Strategies on Supply Chains CO2 Emissions: Simulation Approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136939470&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-14615-2_46&partnerID=40&md5=ec974f50b0e0ef20b717913f5d7f8984

Animals,"Poultry farming is a significant source of revenue generation for small farmers in developing countries. It plays a vital role in fulfilling the daily protein requirements of humans through meat and eggs consumption. The recently emerged pandemic Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) impacts the poultry production sector. Although the whole world is affected, these impacts may be more severe in developing countries due to their dependency on exporting necessary supplies such as feed, vaccines, drugs, and utensils. In this review, we have discussed poultry production in developing countries under the COVID-19 crisis and measures to regain the loss in the poultry industries. Generally, due to the lockdown, trade limitations have negatively impacted poultry industries, which might exacerbate global poverty. Coordinated activities have to be taken at the private and government levels to arrange soft loans so that these farms can restore their production and marketing to normal levels. In addition, here, we have focused on the supply of farm input, feed, other raw materials, management system, improved breeding efficiency, veterinary services, and marketing of egg and meat, which have to be ensured to secure a sustainable poultry production chain.","Attia Y.A., Rahman M.T., Shehata A.A., Hafez H.M., Hossain M.J., Basiouni S., Khafaga A.F.",Poultry Production and Sustainability in Developing Countries under the COVID-19 Crisis: Lessons Learned,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126007782&doi=10.3390%2fani12050644&partnerID=40&md5=5560e997aeab9e0fcd23733da902872d

Renewable Energy,"Previous assessments for the sustainability of global supply chains have mostly focused on the single environmental aspect, that is, the accounting of pollutant leakage. Considering that the impact of supply chain on sustainability is transnational and multi-dimensional, this study proposes a supply chain green-degree assessment method based on multi-regional input-output model (MRIO) and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The proposed method integrates economic and environmental factors embodied in the supply chains into a green-degree indicator, while taking into account the constraints of energy consumption structure. Based on this method, we account for the renewable and non-renewable energy consumption embodied in global supply chains and measure the supply chains green-degree. The results show that 27% of renewable energy is consumed in the cross-border production of goods and services, and the participation of renewable energy in global supply chains is increasing. The green-degree of the current global supply chains is quite low, with an average score of only 0.45. The outsourcing of production and processing activities has made developed economies' supply chains “less clean”, and their green-degree has dropped by 5.3% between 2000 and 2014, while the emerging developing economies’ have become cleaner, and their green-degree has increased by 10.5%.","Wang Q., Jiang F., Li R.",Assessing supply chain greenness from the perspective of embodied renewable energy – A data envelopment analysis using multi-regional input-output analysis,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126854178&doi=10.1016%2fj.renene.2022.02.128&partnerID=40&md5=fa9fbd7a17c82a378482d8b490271f96

Transboundary and Emerging Diseases,"Prions and certain endoparasites, bacteria, and viruses are internationally recognized as types of disease-causing biological agents that can be transmitted from contaminated feed to animals. Historically, foodborne biological hazards such as prions (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), endoparasites (Trichinella spiralis, Toxoplasma gondii), and pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157, Clostridium spp., and Campylobacter spp.) were major food safety concerns from feeding uncooked or improperly heated animal-derived food waste and by-products. However, implementation of validated thermal processing conditions along with verifiable quality control procedures has been effective in enabling safe use of these feed materials in animal diets. More recently, the occurrence of global Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus and African Swine Fever Virus epidemics, dependence on international feed ingredient supply chains, and the discovery that these viruses can survive in some feed ingredient matrices under environmental conditions of trans-oceanic shipments has created an urgent need to develop and implement rigorous biosecurity protocols that prevent and control animal viruses in feed ingredients. Implementation of verifiable risk-based preventive controls, traceability systems from origin to destination, and effective mitigation procedures is essential to minimize these food security, safety, and sustainability threats.

Manufacturing and Service Operations Management,"Problem definition: Novel life-improving products, such as solar lanterns and energy-efficient cookstoves address essential needs of consumers in the base of the pyramid (BOP). However, their profitable distribution is often difficult because BOP customers are risk-averse, their ability to pay (ATP) is lower than their willingness to pay, and they face uncertainty regarding these products' value. Academic/practical relevance: We examine two practical strategies from distributors in the BOP: (1) improving the product's affordability through a discount and (2) increasing awareness of the product's value. Our results identify BOP-specific operational trade-offs in implementing these strategies. We also propose strategies to manage these trade-offs that can increase consumer surplus in the BOP. Methodology: We introduce a supply chain model for the BOP and analyze the distributor's pricing problem with refunds as well as the distributor's optimal budget allocation between strategies (1) and (2). Results: We find that, in the BOP, the distributor's profit-maximizing budget allocation often yields the lowest consumer surplus. This misalignment between profits and consumer surplus disappears if customers' ATP is high. Moreover, the misalignment can be resolved if the distributor offers free product returns and commits to a maximum retail price. We confirm the robustness of our results through numerical simulations. Managerial implications: Best operations strategy practices in the BOP can differ significantly from developed markets. Furthermore, BOP customers' limited ATP and high risk aversion generate a BOP-specific misalignment between profits and consumer surplus. Operational commitments, such as free returns, reduce this misalignment and can serve as a signal to investors of a social enterprise's focus on consumer surplus.

Manufacturing and Service Operations Management,"Problem definition: This paper investigates how counterfeits influence a global supply chain and how the supply chain should effectively take anticounterfeit actions. Academic/practical relevance: The impacts of counterfeiting have been increasingly profound on global supply chains. It is critical to understand how counterfeiting impacts supply chains when supply chain members act in their own interests, and how supply chains can effectively combat counterfeiting when all the members can contribute to it. This is the first paper that offers insights into these important questions. In particular, we examine who among the supply chain members is in the best position to perform counteracting activities, how these members can cooperate in anticounterfeiting, and what economic implications the anticounterfeit actions have to the supply chain, individual firms, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Methodology: We consider a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, and analyze a game-theoretical framework to derive the equilibrium. Results: The manufacturer prefers to induce the retailer to combat counterfeits rather than to combat itself. Contrary to conventional wisdom, counterfeits can increase the supply chain’s profit even in the absence of network externality effects. The crux is that the manufacturer lowers wholesale price to incentivize the retailer’s counteraction and, consequently, the threat of counterfeits can mitigate double marginalization and benefit the supply chain. Managerial implications: Our results demonstrate that a sustainability risk can trigger collaborative endeavors of supply chain members and thus be advantageous to the supply chain. The findings also underscore the important role that retailers should play in anticounterfeiting. Particularly, it can be in the supply chain’s interest that the manufacturer does not execute the counteraction, either jointly with the retailer or by itself.

Manufacturing and Service Operations Management,"Problem definition: To manage supplier social responsibility (SR), some firms have adopted a self-assessment strategy whereby they ask suppliers to self-report SR capabilities. Self-reported information is difficult to verify, and this leads to an important credibility question: can a buyer expect truthful reporting? We examine whether a supplier’s SR capability can be credibly communicated through free and unverifiable self-reporting. Academic/practical relevance: SR is a strategic focus for firms because consumers care about ethical production. Some firms rely on supplier self-assessment as part of their SR strategy. It is important to understand the value and challenges of this approach. Methodology: We develop a cheap talk model of a supplier and a buyer. The supplier is endowed with a given SR level (privately known to the supplier) that represents the probability of no violation. The buyer sells in a market that is sensitive to publicized SR violations. The supplier first communicates its SR level to the buyer, and then the buyer chooses between two audit stringency levels to conduct on the supplier and also chooses how much to order. Results: Influential truthful communication may emerge in equilibrium if (i) the buyer orders a larger quantity from the high-type supplier but imposes a more stringent audit than the buyer would for the low type and (ii) the high-type supplier opts for this larger order, whereas the low-type, fearing audit failure, does not. The buyer can benefit as the audit becomes more expensive. Managerial implications: Supplier SR self-assessments can be a valuable strategy for buyers but only if the buyer has access to auditing capabilities of different levels and does not precommit to a particular level. It is valuable for firms to engage in an up-front auditing step to ensure a minimum SR capability of approved suppliers because very low-performing suppliers never truthfully report. Implementing supplier self-assessments may or may not help reduce the social damage resulting from potential SR violations; we identify situations when it helps and when it does not.","Lu T., Tomlin B.",Sourcing from a Self-Reporting Supplier: Strategic Communication of Social Responsibility in a Supply Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132216329&doi=10.1287%2fmsom.2021.0978&partnerID=40&md5=3a66d7a5738c7e4f3375256da7ac8d65
Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,"Problems with the environment are constantly increasing. The general public is also worried about this subject. The government of India has been making continuous efforts to implement green manufacturing in industries in many ways. So that the environment can be saved from getting worse. With regards to the environment, the awareness among consumers is also increasing and they buy the same products which do not harm the environment. Sustainability can be achieved by the implementation of Green Manufacturing (GM) in various business sectors like the automotive industry, green supply chain management, marketing, and information management. The aim of this research paper is to identify and analyze the Critical Success Factor (CSFs) of green manufacturing sustainability in the automotive industry. In this research paper, the CSFs of GM are derived from extensive literature reviews. The reliability of these factors is derived from the calculation of Cronbach’s alpha. Pair-wise comparison of these factors is done by Fuzzy-AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method after prioritization of CSFs. This key area recommends various measures for improvement and implementation of GM in the automotive industry. With the help of this study result, identification of CSFs, weightage of identified CSFs of GM in the automotive industry has been realized.","Singh P.L., Sindhwani R., Sharma B.P., Srivastava P., Rajpoot P., Lalit, Rahul, Kumar R.",Analyse the Critical Success Factor of Green Manufacturing for Achieving Sustainability in Automotive Sector,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113792372&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-3330-0_7&partnerID=40&md5=6496a888bc91b79ae84d4c6779812d63
"Resources, Environment and Sustainability","Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) plays a key role in digital transformation demanded by Industry 4.0 and life cycle assessment, including sustainability assessment. Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) applications can support PLM by integrating heterogeneous knowledge from different stages throughout the product life. However, the integration of knowledge from different stages and teams can cause misunderstanding if not represented in a unified form. Furthermore, different forms of knowledge used by different software are neither machine-readable nor human-readable, which also sets obstacles to knowledge integration in KBE applications. Supply chain sustainability assessment is such a scenario that entails integrating knowledge from different sources. This paper firstly implements a sustainability assessment method from other scholar to calculate the supply chain sustainability performance and adapts a sustainability assessment ontology for supply chain sustainability assessment. Then, an example KBE application is developed by implementing the sustainability assessment ontology and calculation method to simulate the knowledge sharing and integration between different teams. Finally, through this example application, it is discussed that the implementation of ontology to represent knowledge in PLM application for collaborative tasks like sustainability assessment can increase the efficiency of data sharing and integration. This paper is a proof of concept for the ontology-based framework. This framework can facilitate to represent knowledge but not create new knowledge, which means it can increase the efficiency of the software development, but cannot provide a better calculation method and assessment framework for supply chain sustainability assessment.","Zhang L., Olsen A., Lobov A.",An ontology-based KBE application for supply chain sustainability assessment,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135877744&doi=10.1016%2fj.resenv.2022.100086&partnerID=40&md5=19440a67fc92853eb032b2d971c80b53
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Product take-back systems are fundamental for Circular Economy (CE) and focus on recovering value by taking back products to be recycled, re-manufactured, or refurbished. In theory, the expected value from CE is undeniable. However, in practice product take-back systems are often in small/pilot scale or have difficulties becoming financially viable, which is an obstacle towards the widespread adoption of CE in practice and thus a barrier to achieving a sustainable manufacturing system. This study uses a structured literature review to explore the factors affecting the financial performance of the product take-back system and investigate how 12 factors, clustered into three different dimensions; context, supply chain, and company, affect financial performance. Based on these findings, two propositions are made on how these factors are interrelated in a system perspective and how further research should build on these findings.","Uhrenholt J.N., Kristensen J.H., Rincón M.C., Jensen S.F., Waehrens B.V.",Circular economy: Factors affecting the financial performance of product take-back systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122313272&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2021.130319&partnerID=40&md5=d742690b8c79d9b41a929a0c4402909b

Journal of Environmental Management,"Proper disposal of Municipal Solid (MSW) waste is an important issue as it causes land, air, and water pollution. Organic MSW provides a habitat environment to insects and often it spreads dangerous diseases. Major reasons identified behind this as the non-separation of MSW at the source and lack of facilities (bins) in the appropriate place for collection of wastes. The present study has proposed an integrated three-stage model to provide a solution to the problem of (i) allocation of the bin for waste collection, (ii) allocation and comparison of centralized and decentralized composting plants, and finally, (iii) vehicle routing for waste collection. The proposed generic model is applied to an Indian city, Bilaspur located in the state of Chhattisgarh. From the results, it is observed that the first stage model provides an optimal number of bins required and allocation of it at minimum cost. Taking it as input for the second stage model, it identifies the best locations for centralized and decentralized composting plants. The result also reveals that decentralized composting plants are more economical than centralized plants. Finally, the third stage of the model identifies the vehicle routing for the waste collection considering both centralized and decentralized plants to minimize the cost. Further, sensitivity analysis is carried out on collection rate and participation percentage parameters to draw additional insights for better management of MSW.","Rathore P., Chakraborty S., Gupta M., Sarmah S.P.",Towards a sustainable organic waste supply chain: A comparison of centralized and decentralized systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129315620&doi=10.1016%2fj.jenvman.2022.115141&partnerID=40&md5=54f52f0f5c7e8635441f0b2195fc8a67
Processes,"Proper inventory management is vital to achieving sustainability within a supply chain and is also related to a company’s cash flow through the funds represented by the inventory. Therefore, it is necessary to balance excess inventory and insufficient inventory. However, this can be difficult to achieve in the presence of stochastic demand because decisions must be made in an uncertain environment and the inventory policy bears risks associated with each decision. This study reports an extension of the single-period model for the inventory problem under uncertain demand. We proposed incorporating a Gaussian stochastic process into the model using the associated posterior distribution of the Gaussian process as a distribution for the demand. This enables the modeling of data from historical inventory demand using the Gaussian process theory, which adapts well to small datasets and provides measurements of the risks associated with the predictions made. Thus, unlike other works that assume that demand follows an autoregressive or Brownian motion model, among others, our approach enables adaptability to different complex forms of demand trends over time. We offer several numerical examples that explore aspects of the proposed approach and compare our results with those achieved using other state-of-the-art methods.","Mejia J., Avelar-Sosa L., Mederos B., García-Alcaraz J.L.",Inventory Model with Stochastic Demand Using Single-Period Inventory Model and Gaussian Process,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129255638&doi=10.3390%2fpr10040783&partnerID=40&md5=b999508b0d3ece95940d3b9bbd7176e2
Business Strategy and the Environment,"Public sector purchasing processes are gaining increasing prominence as a demand-side innovation tool for addressing national sustainability challenges. Accordingly, there has been growing research attention to this topic. Prior studies suggest three key rationales that underlie the use of public sector procurement to drive innovation: (i) the buyer–user rationale (for creating new needs); (ii) the market/system failure rationale (for improving suppliers' capacity to innovate); and (iii) the public services rationale (for improving public services). However, operational activities at the upstream supply chain affecting the sustainable innovation capacities of supplier firms appear to be under-researched in the public procurement for innovation (PPI) scholarship, despite knowledge about innovation capacity being critical to successfully implementing PPI. This paper adopts a systematic literature review approach to synthesise existing fragmented literature on sustainability-oriented PPI, focusing on supplier perspectives. Findings from a synthesis of 41 relevant articles suggest, among others conditions, that a procurement framework that maintains a good balance of competition and innovation, builds buyer–supplier relationship and urges strong supply networks, maintains a stable political commitment, offers security for niche markets with effective innovation risk management culture would enhance suppliers' sustainability capacity and propensity to innovate. This paper contributes to the PPI literature and the literature on determinants of sustainable innovation systems from supplier firms' sustainability lens.","Adjei-Bamfo P., Djajadikerta H.G., Jie F., Brown K., Kiani Mavi R.",Public procurement for innovation through supplier firms' sustainability lens: A systematic review and research agenda,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130469431&doi=10.1002%2fbse.3137&partnerID=40&md5=c2dbbe38e1a837254ff78bfd19a96e49
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Public sector spending represents a significant portion of gross domestic product in most countries, and holds much promise to advance calls to improve the sustainability of goods and services provided by supply chain partners – but only if multiple objectives can be reconciled. Public procurement also tends to heavily emphasize outcome-based specification practices that rely on traditional tendering for supplier selection, thereby stifling potentially innovative improvements. Drawing on stakeholder theory, we consider how potential inter-stakeholder tensions contribute to both the challenges and opportunities for green public procurement (GPP) practices. In addition to conventional categories of internal and external stakeholders, we identify a third category of stakeholders who ‘bridge’ across these two groups. This framing helps to delineate complex interactions among multiple stakeholder groups and enables a mapping of each group's weighting of priorities and influence in decision making. Doing so highlights potential sources of inter-stakeholder tensions that must be balanced or resolved to advance GPP. Moreover, process-based collaboration can engage multiple groups of stakeholders, attenuate inter-stakeholder tensions, and foster cooperative, novel solutions for improved environmental outcomes. Drawing from an initial case study, new research directions emerge when we combine both process- and outcome-based practices that engage supply chain partners and multiple stakeholders to develop and advance new green technologies and evaluate complex considerations in public sector procurement.","Johnson P.F., Klassen R.D.",New directions for research in green public procurement: The challenge of inter-stakeholder tensions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127274344&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2021.100017&partnerID=40&md5=eadad6076817f8e487cd6e9a0bae34f6
Annals of Operations Research,"Purchasing occupies a strategic role in supply chain management for a firm and is the driver of competitive advantage. Owing to the high purchase cost to revenue ratio, decisions such as evaluation, selection, and performance management of suppliers are of the matter of immense interest to firms. Multi-criteria decision making tools allow the purchasing managers to evaluate the suppliers holistically. One such tool, data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been used extensively for supplier evaluation and selection. This paper presents a comprehensive review of 161 articles published since 2000, on the application of DEA in supplier selection. These articles are located from the Scopus database. With little existing literature on a full-fledged review, this work envisages to be first of its kind, by aiding DEA practitioners in purchasing function. The analysis of the study indicates the emergence of the theme of green supply chain and sustainability in recent years as well as the adoption of hybrid approaches to solving the problem of supplier selection using DEA.

This study aimed to identify the power sources of focal firms and first- and lower-tier suppliers and to investigate how they may affect their ability to cascade sustainability requirements along multi-tier supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: A multiple case study of 24 companies was conducted to investigate the sources of power in multi-tier supply chains. In total, 42 informants from five focal companies, ten first-tier suppliers and nine lower-tier suppliers were interviewed.

International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management,"Purpose: Agricultural supply chains witness several challenges, which result in increased cost of operations, high wastages, and low efficiency. In the case of vegetable supply chains (VSCs), the intensity of challenges is very high due to perishability. Literature suggests various operations research tools for supply chain management of perishables, but there is a paucity of research highlighting the real models adopted by real players in the market while making revenue.

International Journal of Organizational Analysis,"Purpose: Along with rapid development in the green supply chain fields, questions have been raised about the direct effects of internal and external drivers. Recent evidence suggest that organizational culture is a prerequisite for the understanding of green supply chain management (GSCM). However, there has been limited examination of organizational culture in the green supply chain research area. The purpose of this paper is to understand the relationship between green supply chain management (GSCM) and organizational culture. Design/methodology/approach: To do so, a bibliometric analysis is carried out. The search was conducted in the Scopus database by using different keywords. The records found were scanned and refined bringing the total number of documents to 46. A descriptive analysis covering influential authors, leading journals, contributing organizations and most popular words used in titles and keywords, using the Biblioshiny app, followed by a content analysis have been conducted. Findings: The findings show the following: most of the influential studies were conducted by only a few researchers. The publications within the field started to increase during 2012–2020. It is worth mentioning, that the USA and UK universities have a strong research contribution among all, and there are seven core publishing journals that lead the field such as cleaner of production and sustainability. The content analysis revealed some aspects and shed light on two main topics: organizational culture as a driver or a barrier toward GSCM; and the organizational culture contribution role on the impact of GSCM on performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper only addresses GSCM with organizational culture based on a small sample of papers. Furthermore, this study needs to be expanded with empirical research on the topic. It would be interesting to assess the effects of national culture within the same research area.

International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management,"Purpose: An apparel supply chain primarily consists of geographically distant suppliers, manufacturers and retailers. The coordination among the members of the supply chain becomes difficult when we consider the triple bottom line of sustainability in it. Moreover, the complexity increases with the change in dominance power of the respective members. However, the task of managing the channel further becomes complicated after incorporating sustainability and dominance power simultaneously into the supply chain. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on designing of mechanism and demonstration of three-echelon model to coordinate sustainable supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the noncooperative game theoretic method has been applied for the exploration of models. The various structures of the centralized and decentralized supply chain are considered on the basis of a player's dominance power. The model uses simultaneous and sequential move games to analyze optimal profit of supply chain agents, total channel profit, green innovation level and corporate social innovation level. Findings: Analytical results show that simultaneous game performs better than the sequential game. The consumer sensitivity toward green and social innovations increases total channel profit. We also proposed a linear two-part tariff contract model. The proposed model enhances the sustainability level and leads to perfect channel coordination. Using a numerical example, we present the effectiveness of multiple game structures under centralized and decentralized settings. The results reveal that channel efficiency is the highest in the two-part tariff contract followed by a simultaneous move game structure and lower in the cases of sequential move game. Research limitations/implications: In this research, model setting are deterministic and there is no any information asymmetry. Therefore researchers are encouraged to study multiechelon sustainable supply chain coordination models under stochastic and information asymmetry settings. Practical implications: The paper includes implications for the development of sustainable supply chain coordination model to tackle the problems of dominance power, sustainability issues and lower channel efficiency of supply chain. Originality/value: This study proposes game-theory-based three-echelon sustainable supply chain for the channel coordination.","Kumar P., Sharma D., Pandey P.",Three-echelon apparel supply chain coordination with triple bottom line approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117832602&doi=10.1108%2fIJQRM-04-2021-0101&partnerID=40&md5=f85d6e6c41fdd1a86da0284d0c47d51c
Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal,"Purpose: Appropriate disposal of end-of-life (EOL) electric vehicle battery (EVB) requires new method of supply chain management (SCM) toward sustainability.

International Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Purpose: As focal firms in supply networks reflect on their experiences of the pandemic and begin to rethink their operations and supply chains, there is a significant opportunity to leverage digital technological advances to enhance socially responsible operations performance (SROP). This paper develops a novel framework for exploring the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies for improving SROP. It highlights current best-practice examples and presents future research pathways. Design/methodology/approach: This viewpoint paper argues how Industry 4.0 technology adoption can enable effective SROP in the post-COVID-19 era. Academic articles, relevant grey literature, and insights from industry experts are used to support the development of the framework. Findings: Seven technologies are identified that bring transformational capabilities to SROP, i.e. big data analytics, digital twins, augmented reality, blockchain, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. It is demonstrated how these technologies can help to improve three sub-themes of organisational social performance (employment practices, health and safety, and business practices) and three sub-themes of community social performance (quality of life and social welfare, social governance, and economic welfare and growth). Research limitations/implications: A research agenda is outlined at the intersection of Industry 4.0 and SROP through the six sub-themes of organisational and community social performance. Further, these are connected through three overarching research agendas: “Trust through Technology”, “Responsible Relationships” and “Freedom through Flexibility”. Practical implications: Organisational agendas for Industry 4.0 and social responsibility can be complementary. The framework provides insights into how Industry 4.0 technologies can help firms achieve long-term post-COVID-19 recovery, with an emphasis on SROP. This can offer firms competitive advantage in the “new normal” by helping them build back better. Social implications: People and communities should be at the heart of decisions about rethinking operations and supply chains. This paper expresses a view on what it entails for organisations to be responsible for the supply chain-wide social wellbeing of employees and the wider community they operate in, and how they can use technology to embed social responsibility in their operations and supply chains. Originality/value: Contributes to the limited understanding of how Industry 4.0 technologies can lead to socially responsible transformations.

International Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Purpose: As large multinational firms are increasingly tasked with developing sustainable supply chains, their role in improving the sustainability performance of their suppliers is critical. This paper examines the dual role of a buyer firm, as a customer and as an important stakeholder, and identifies several attributes of the buyer firm and the dyadic relationship that could help improve the sustainability performance of suppliers. Design/methodology/approach: A dyadic multi-year dataset is created using financial and customer data from the Compustat database and sustainability data from MSCI ESG ratings database. The hypotheses are tested using econometric panel data techniques. Findings: The findings indicate that a buyer's legitimacy is a key factor that affects supplier's sustainability performance. The effect of legitimacy is much higher when the buyer and supplier firms have an aligned focus on similar sustainability dimensions. The market power of the buyer also increases the effect of legitimacy, though power without legitimacy is not effective. Originality/value: The study expands the understanding of how buyer firms can influence suppliers on sustainability by highlighting the key role played by legitimacy and aligned focus and the supporting role of market power. The study contributes to both the stakeholder salience literature and the buyer–supplier relationship literature by showing evidence for complementarity between market power and legitimacy.

Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management,"Purpose: Australians consume twice the global average of textiles and are deeply engaged in a linear take/make/waste fashion model. Furthermore the Australian fashion sector has some unique supply chain complications of geographical distances, sparse population and fragmentation in processing and manufacturing. This research aims to examine how Australian fashion small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are overcoming these challenges to run fashion businesses built around core principles of product stewardship (PS) and circularity. Design/methodology/approach: SMEs make up 88% of the Australian apparel manufacturing sector. This qualitative exploratory study included in-depth interviews with three Australian fashion SMEs engaged in circular design practice, and a focus group of 10 Western Australian fashion advocates of sustainability. Analytic coding and analysis of the data developed eight distinct themes. Findings: This study examines the barriers to circular economy (CE) that exist in the Australian fashion sector, and maps the practice of Australian SMEs with circular business models in overcoming these barriers. In CE innovation, Australian SMEs may have an advantage over larger fashion companies with more unwieldy structures. Employing design-thinking strategies, Australian SMEs with a foundation of PS and circular purpose are creating new systems of viable closed-loop business models and design processes. Originality/value: The themes from this research contribute to the limited literature on circular innovation examples that link CE theory with practice in the fashion sector.

"Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management","Purpose: Bamboo is still a traditional material that requires additional development before it can be considered as a modern and reliable alternative to steel, wood, and concrete. When compared to the huge volumes of information available on timber and concrete, bamboo has a little quantity of information. When it comes to estimating bamboo structures, there are not many options. As a result, pinpointing the key qualities and events that aid or impede bamboo's integration into the construction sector is vital. Design/methodology/approach: Factor analysis (FA) was used for summarizing and reducing data to significant ones in identifying barriers, benefits and potentials of using bamboo materials for construction. In this method, small number of factors was aimed at to explain most of the variances observed in a much larger number of variables. The goal was to identify not-directly-observable barriers and opportunities based on a larger set of observable or measurable indicators identified from literature. It attempted to identify underlying challenges and potentials that lay the patterns of bamboo material usage in the construction sector. Findings: From the results of FA, six specific components with loadings greater than 0.5 were kept for both the barrier and the advantages of using bamboo Lack of awareness on bamboo material, Unorganized supply chain, Exclusion from standards, Outperformance of industrial products, Lack of innovation and institutional support and Bamboo's mechanistic limitation was considered to be the root causes of all barriers. On the other end, structural suitability of bamboo, viable timber alternative, meeting sustainability's demand, attractive economic model, cost effective material, positive social implications were labeled as benefits of bamboo. Finally, major recommendation regarding research, facility, institutionalizing and resource management were forwarded. Originality/value: Ethiopia is a major bamboo producer in Africa. The bamboo sector, on the other hand, remains a part of the undeveloped and informal rural economy, preventing it from reaching its full potential. Despite technological advancements, bamboo is not commonly used in construction. As a result, using bamboo as a building material is frowned upon. In order to take effective action to accommodate bamboo as an alternative building material, significant challenges, benefits, and potential of the material must be stated with this purpose in mind.","Hailemariam E.K., Hailemariam L.M., Amede E.A., Nuramo D.A.","Identification of barriers, benefits and opportunities of using bamboo materials for structural purposes",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129185742&doi=10.1108%2fECAM-11-2021-0996&partnerID=40&md5=89db80d36a9765c61227d5f9bc1c88fd

International Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Purpose: Companies' ability to build sustainable supply chains and achieve strategic sustainability objectives largely depends on their supply network characteristics and the nature of the relationships with strategic suppliers. This poses the question of how purchasing departments can help to translate this sustainability commitment into performance benefits. The authors focus the attention on buyer-supplier information sharing practices and study how the availability of information interplays with the purchasing realized absorptive capacity (PRAC) to positively impact performance (operational, environmental and social). Design/methodology/approach: The study collected data from 305 procurement executives in four European countries and tested the hypotheses empirically using structural equation modeling. Mediation analysis is used to test the effect of PRAC on the relationship between buyer-supplier information sharing and performance. Findings: The results show that increasing buyer-supplier information sharing is sufficient to obtain a positive impact on operational performance. To improve purchasing sustainability performance, companies need to develop their PRAC to adequately transform and exploit external information and identify opportunities in the environmental and social areas. Thanks to these purchasing capabilities, organizations can overcome potential trade-offs between different performance dimensions. Originality/value: In the context of collaborative buyer-supplier relationships, this study is one of the first to propose purchasing knowledge management capabilities (i.e. PRAC) as a key factor to improve multiple performance dimensions.

Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal,"Purpose: Creating visibility in the supply chain (SC) helps in making it resilient. Integrating the SC with Industry 4.0 key enabling technologies creates visibility and sustainability in SCs. It also fosters intelligent decision-making, thereby making a SC smart. However, how Industry 4.0 technologies affect key performance indicators (KPIs) of a resilient SC and may help achieve sustainability is rarely studied. Design/methodology/approach: Sixteen KPIs were identified from the literature review and analyzed using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) using expert opinions. Further, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for the KPIs by varying the weightage of the criteria. Later, KPIs results were analyzed, and (1) how and which Industry 4.0 technology helps improve the KPI? (2) Resilience relationship with sustainability? were discussed. Findings: The analyses show that the time-oriented (TO) is an essential criterion and organizational (OR) is the less important comparatively. Lead time, time to market and risk assessment frequency are the top KPIs that need a focus.

International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management,"Purpose: Current online business development redistributes last-mile logistics (LML) from consumer to retailer and producer. This paper identifies how empirical LML research has used and defined logistic performance measures for key grocery industry actors. Using a multi-actor perspective on logistic performance, the authors discuss coordination issues important for optimising LML at system level. Design/methodology/approach: A semi-systematic literature review of 85 publications was conducted to analyse performance measurements used for effectiveness and efficiency, and for which actors. Findings: Few empirical LML studies exist examining coordination between key actors or on system level. Most studies focus on logistic performance measurements for retailers and/or consumers, not producers. Key goals and resource utilisations lack research, including all key actors and system-level coordination.

Through expanding on efficiency and effectiveness interplay at system level and introducing new research perspectives, the review highlights the need to revaluate single-actor, single-measurement studies. Practical implications: No established scientific guidelines exist for solving LML optimisation in the grocery industry. For managers, it is important to thoroughly consider efficiency and effectiveness in LML execution, coordination and collaboration among key actors, avoiding sub-optimisations for business and sustainability. Originality/value: The study contributes to current knowledge by reviewing empirical research on LML performance in the grocery sector, showing how previous research disregards the importance of multiple actors and coordination of actors, efficiency and effectiveness.","Lagin M., Håkansson J., Nordström C., Nyberg R.G., Öberg C.",Last-mile logistics of perishable products: a review of effectiveness and efficiency measures used in empirical research,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136509976&doi=10.1108%2fIJRDM-02-2021-0080&partnerID=40&md5=5bcc7eba90771734e131ffcdee7cdf0d

Benchmarking,"Purpose: Despite increasing attentions to sustainable service supply chain management (SSSCM), a framework for performance evaluation of sustainable service only supply chain management (SSOSCM) is still missing. This paper tries to fill this gap and provides a novel conceptual framework. Design/methodology/approach: The articles related to SSSCM are fetched from the databases of SCOPUS and Web of Science. Analysis of 174 articles identified by the systematic literature review is further carried out. Findings: This research identifies the sustainable practices for service only supply chain (SOSC) as environmental management, social management, economic management, customer management, health, safety and risk management, technical sustainability, institutional sustainability, information and technology management as well as two performance measurement criteria as operational performance and organizational performance. This paper provides a novel conceptual framework for the performance evaluation of SSOSCM. The results call for future exploration in the following three broad directions-(1) customer's perception, involvement and their behaviour towards sustainability in SOSC context; (2) trade-off, incentive mechanism and multilevel evaluation for achieving sustainability in SOSC and (3) sustainability in SOSC from various point of views.

International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,"Purpose: Digital innovation and circular business model innovation are two critical enablers of a circular economy. A wide variety of digital technologies such as blockchain, 3D printing, cyber-physical systems, or big data also diverges the applications of digital technologies in circular business models. Given heterogeneous attributes of circular business models and digital technologies, the selections of digital technologies and circular business models might be highly distinctive within and between sectorial contexts. This paper examines digital circular business models in the context of the fashion industry and its multiple actors. This industry as the world’s second polluting industry requires an urgent circular economy (CE) transition with less resource consumption, lower waste emissions and a more stable economy. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive, exploratory multiple-case study method is employed to investigate the ten cases of different sized fashion companies (i.e. large, small medium-sized firm (SME) and startup firms). The comparison across cases is conducted to understand fashion firms' distinct behaviours in adopting various digital circular economy strategies. Findings: The paper presents three archetypes of digital-based circular business models in the fashion industry: the blockchain-based supply chain model, the service-based model and the pull demand-driven model. Besides incremental innovations, the radical business model and digital innovations as presented in the pull demand-driven model may be crucial to the fashion circular economy transition. The pull demand–driven model may shift the economy from scales to scopes, change the whole process of how the fashion items are forecasted, produced, and used, and reform consumer behaviours. The paths of adopting digital fashion circular business models are also different among large, SMEs and startup fashion firms. Practical implications: The study provides business managers with empirical insights on how circular business models (CBMs) should be chosen according to intrinsic business capacities, technological competences and CE strategies. The emerging trends of new fashion markets (e.g. rental, subscription) and consumers' sustainable awareness should be not be neglected. Moreover, besides adopting recycling and reuse strategies, large fashion incumbents consider collaborating with other technology suppliers and startup companies to incubate more radical innovations. Social implications: Appropriate policies and regulations should be enacted to enable the digital CE transition. Market patterns and consumer acceptances are considered highly challenging to these digital fashion models. A balanced policy on both the demand and supply sides are suggested. The one-side policy may fail CBMs that entail an upside-down collaboration of both producers and consumers. Moreover, it is perhaps time to rethink how to reduce unnecessary new demand rather than repeatedly producing and recycling. Originality/value: The pace of CE research is lagging far behind the accelerating environmental contamination by the fashion industry. The study aims to narrow the gap between theory and practice to harmonise fashion firms' orchestration and accelerate the transition of the fashion industry towards the CE.

Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal,"Purpose: Drawing on the combined theoretical perspectives offered by the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices view and the resource-based view (RBV), this study aims to examine whether pursuit of environmental, social and economic sustainability measures of SSCM practices drive competitive advantage (CA) among fashion-apparel manufacturing organizations in an emerging economy. Furthermore, the study investigates whether the above relationships are mediated by productivity. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a theoretically supported conceptual framework, a set of hypotheses are tested by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling on a sample of 345 export-oriented fashion-apparel manufacturing companies in Bangladesh. SmartPLS (v.3.2) is applied to analyze the path model through bootstrapping procedure. Findings: The findings suggest that the direct relationship between social sustainability dimension of SSCM practices along and CA is positive and significant. While the direct relationships between environmental sustainability and CA, and economic sustainability and CA, were found to be non-significant. However, when productivity was applied as a mediator, all the paths were significant. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the strategic management literature by presenting a combined theoretical perspective proposing the idea that sustainable supply chain practices can influence both productivity and CA, where productivity is a pertinent mediator. Practical implications: The study presents evidence for ready-made garments manufacturers in emerging economies on how compliance with environmental, social and economic sustainability measures in the supply chain of apparel manufacturers leads to gains in CA for the firms. Additionally, the study shows that such measures must also have a net positive impact on productivity to be able to influence CA significantly.

British Food Journal,"Purpose: Due to the political, economic and infrastructure barriers and risks that international entrepreneurs (IEs) face when researching an emerging economy's agrifood sector, this research aims to identify the major barriers, analyse their relationships, quantify their importance, classify and rank them. Thus, the IEs will gain a better understanding and vision of their decision-making processes in this era. Design/methodology/approach: To do this, the authors first created a list of barriers to entry for IEs into Iran's rising economy's agrifood industry. Following that, a multi-layer decision-making approach was developed and implemented to accomplish the research objectives. The first stage utilized a hybrid of interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) to depict the level-based conceptual model and classification of the IEs’ obstacles to entry into the agrifood sector. Following that, a hybrid decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and analytic network process (ANP) called DANP was utilized to present a causal relationship between the barriers, identify their causes and effects, and also quantify the relevance of each barrier. Findings: After employing the multi-layer decision-making approach, the results demonstrated that fundamental limitations, including infrastructure and technology limitations, are the most critical barriers alongside policy factors encompassing governmental support and access to global or regional economy/market. According to the results, innovation and economic sustainability of the agrifood supply chain also matter. All of these critical barriers are intertwined and should be planned and solved simultaneously. Furthermore, based on DANP results, the sustainability pillars (economy, environment, society), besides the low efficiency of the agrifood sector in Iran, should be investigated further for future policy makings. Originality/value: A hybrid multi-layer decision-making approach has been used for analysing the barriers of investment in the agrifood sector of the emerging economy of Iran for the international entrepreneurs.

Benchmarking,"Purpose: During the past decade, the green workplace has attracted the attention of academics and industry alike. As a result, new research areas like green human resource management (GHRM) started emerging. Green workplace means greening of traditional business functions, namely, human resource management, marketing, operations and supply chain. GHRM can play a strategic role in enabling organizations to implement and formulate sustainable strategies and help them achieve corporate sustainability. This paper helps understand the GHRM scholarship and provides an up-to-date account of GHRM practices. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors have adopted the bibliometric analysis method to analyse and draw inferences from 247 articles retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database for the time horizon of almost two decades: 2005 to June 2021.

International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,"Purpose: Fashion brands are under heavy criticism for often exhibiting poor working conditions and producing environmental damage. Pressure comes from initiatives such as Fashion Transparency Index (FTI) by Fashion Revolution to assess fashion brands' transparency based on information publicly disclosed. But an understanding of how such movements reflect in a Global South country characterised by institutional voids is still absent. Design/methodology/approach: While the FTI ranks individual brands, in this study the authors have analysed 305 documents extracted from the websites of 20 Brazilian fashion brands to unpack practices and re-bundle them according to three archetypes – opaque, translucent and transparent – that display a maturity curve. Findings: The authors show that advancement is heterogeneous, and we complement previous research exposing the limits of an NGO in driving transparency by investigating a context embedded in institutional voids. The authors show that most fashion brands restrict transparency to tier-1 suppliers. Moreover, although fashion brands increasingly demand disclosure from their suppliers, they do not clarify their own purchasing practices such as cancellation and payment policies. On the positive note, the authors show that maturity for transparent brands can include the actionability concept by engaging with consumer via surveys and educative content. Originality/value: The authors contribute to theory by offering a maturity curve of fashion supply chain transparency.

International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management,"Purpose: Firms employ various forms of disclosure to demonstrate commitment to and involvement in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices. This research provides guidance to firms employing framing strategies when communicating their SSCM with external stakeholders like consumers as part of their supply chain transparency efforts. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employed a middle-range theorizing approach to understand the context of SSCM practices and mechanisms of variously framed communication methods to disclose sustainability information to consumers. The authors conducted two experiments in an e-waste recycling context, studying how sustainable information disclosed to consumers using attribute framing and goal framing can affect consumers' attitudes. The authors also examined the moderating role of consumers' environmental involvement. Findings: Results suggest that when attribute framing is used, firms should avoid framing the attribute from a negative valence. When goal framing is used, messages with consequences stated as “avoid loss” yield the most substantial effect. Additionally, framing effects are more significant for consumers with higher-than-average environmental involvement. Originality/value: The authors’ results contribute to the ongoing theorization of SSCM by providing contextual understanding of how to communicate sustainability information. Corroborating evidence from marketing, framing effects are found to be context specific, thereby elucidating the framing literature more fully to the SSCM context.

International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,"Purpose: Food supply chains (FSCs) are fast becoming more and more complex. Sustainability is a necessary strategy in FSCs to meet the environmental, economic and societal requirements. Industry 4.0 (I4.0) applications for a circular economy (CE) will play a significant role in sustainable food supply chains (SFSCs). I4.0 applications can be used in for traceability, tracking, inspection and quality monitoring, environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, farm input optimization, process automation, etc. to improve circularity and sustainability of FSCs. However, the factors integrating I4.0 and CE adoption in SFSC are not yet very well understood. Furthermore, despite such high potential I4.0 adoption is also met with several barriers. The present study identifies and analyzes twelve barriers for the adoption of I4.0 in SFSC from an CE context. Design/methodology/approach: A cause-effect analysis and prominence ranking of the barriers are done using Rough-DEMATEL technique. DEMATEL is a widely used technique that is applied for a structured analysis of a complex problems. The rough variant of DEMATEL helps include the uncertainty and vagueness of decision maker related to the I4.0 technologies. Findings: “Technological immaturity,” “High investment,” “Lack of awareness and customer acceptance” and “technological limitations and lack of eco-innovation” are identified as the most prominent barriers for adoption of I4.0 in SFSC.

Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,"Purpose: Green sustainability has become a critical challenge for businesses to execute green supply chain management (GSCM). Most of the literature on GSCM emphasizes regulations as drivers and few pieces of research are conducted from an internal organizational culture view. This study aims to use the cultural perspective of market orientation (MO) and draws on both the natural resource-based view (NRBV) and dynamic capability view (DCV) to explore the relationships among green market orientation (GMO), GSCM capability and organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,000 survey questionnaires were distributed to the Taiwanese electronics industry and 207 valid questionnaires were collected. Data was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that GMOs have a significant positive impact on GSCM capability, environmental performance and economic performance. Moreover, GSCM capability is positively related to environmental and economic performance. The results also show that GMOs have a significant indirect influence on environmental performance and economic performance through GSCM capability. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest how Taiwan’s electrical and electronic manufacturers, while faced with pressure from competitors, customers and regulations (i.e. waste electrical and electronic equipment directive, Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive and energy-using products directives), should efficiently and effectively implement GMO and enhance GSCM capability to improve organizational performance.

International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,"Purpose: Halal supply chain management (HSCM) is an emerging research area and is in the early stage of evolution. This study aims to identify 11 critical factors towards effective management of a Halal supply chain (HSC) and provides a framework for the HSCM by evaluating Halal practices' impact on sustainability performance measures empirically. Design/methodology/approach: A structured questionnaire-based survey has been carried out to collect data for analysis. The statistical analysis is accomplished by exploiting merits of factor analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: The results imply that out of 11 critical factors, nine factors on effective management of the HSC are statistically significant, and impacts of two critical factors are positive but statistically insignificant. In the structural model, the path coefficient of all success indicators are positive and statistically significant. In terms of the path coefficient of sustainable performance measures of HSC, all three dimensions, economic, environmental and social, are positive and statistically significant. Research limitations/implications: The research extends Halal and supply chain management's literature by proposing Halal as a standard quality control system, as it focuses on wholesome consumption. Effective management of the HSC is positively related to the firms' sustainable performance, thus helping managers make the organisation sustainable in the long term.

Journal of Global Operations and Strategic Sourcing,"Purpose: In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, all business sectors have critical needs. They face multiple challenges to restructuring their operations to build a resilient, cost-effective and sustainable supply chain. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the practice and the research gaps related to supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: This research paper is influenced by a literature review of the past decade. This review paper incorporates industry challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, including future steps toward developing resilient supply chains in the new normal economy. The research provides a detailed framework for designing cost-effective survivable supply chains that withstand disruptions for the long term. Findings: The proposed research focuses on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains and attempts to bridge pre and post COVID-19 research and practice gaps. Post-COVID-19 resilient supply chains need to be transformed into survivable supply chains. The survivability of the supply chain can be achieved by combining both supply chain resilience and supply chain viability measures. To the best of the authors’ belief, this is the first study that grounds a theory to provide interconnection of five critical supply chain concepts to manage supply chain risk. This study is uniquely positioned to develop a theoretical framework to design a cost-effective, resilient and sustainable supply chain by establishing the interconnection among these concepts in supply chains. This framework helps practitioners to implement the key strategies at the operational, tactical and strategic levels that enhance maturity in supply chains. Research limitations/implications: The research findings are based on secondary reports such as industry reports, cases, research papers and expert opinions. The authors tried to consult with many companies. However, they were reluctant to share the recovery plan information from COVID. Also, as COVID still exists in many places in Canada, the authors could not gather every intended information from the companies. However, the authors have successfully shared the outcomes of this research with a reputed retail company in Canada. They recognized the importance of survivability in supply chains. Going forward, business organizations need to design cost-effective, sustainable and survivable supply chains. Originality/value: The study attempts to unify current research dealing with supply chain resilience. The study concludes with the limitations of the current research. It highlights the prospects of future research and bridges the supply chain practice gaps from the challenges faced by industries due to COVID-19.

International Journal of Emerging Markets,"Purpose: In past years, the global supply chain has witnessed devastating effects of coronavirus (COVID-19) disease. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed the interest of the Sustainable Supply Chain (SSC) stakeholders on sustainability. The stakeholders are now rethinking their business processes and strategy to make them sustainable. In this context, the relevant literature is required to support emerging markets to formulate sustainability-focussed strategies. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of potential antecedents that leads towards sustainable development of freight transportation in emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, the antecedents of the Sustainable Freight Transport (SFT) system are derived from the literature survey followed by verification from the experts. Then, the potential antecedents are categorized under four (social, organizational, operational and environmental) broad categories. Afterwards, a Neutrosophic Analytic Network Process (N-ANP) method is employed to obtain the priority weights of the identified potential antecedents. Findings: The paper identified and ranked 17 antecedents of the SFT system. According to the study’s findings, the top three antecedents of SFT are “the presence of a multimodal transportation system,” “circularity in SFT” and “traffic congestion management”. The results from the study advocate the promotion of existing multi-modal transport facilities which is promising to achieve sustainability. The results suggested the adoption of the digital twin to manage the transport operations.

Journal of Enterprise Information Management,"Purpose: In recent years, a number of researchers have attempted to make an integration of sustainability with supply chain risk management. These studies have led to valued insights into this issue, though there is still a lack of knowledge about the mechanisms by which sustainability-related issues are materialized as risks in the supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: The paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework to evaluate the sustainability risk in the supply chain management mechanism. To do so, a novel approach using the double normalization-based multiple aggregation (DNMA) approach under the intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) environment is extended to identify, rank and evaluate the sustainability risk factors in supply chain management. Findings: To provide comprehensive sustainability risk factors, this study has conducted a survey using interview and literature review. In this regard, this study identified 36 sustainability risk factors in supply chain management of the manufacturing firms in five different groups of risk, including sustainable operational risk factors, economic risk factors, environmental risk factors, social risk factors, and sustainable distribution and recycling risk factors. The results of this paper found that the poor planning and scheduling was the important sustainability risk in supply chain management of the manufacturing firms, followed by the environmental accidents, production capacity risk, product design risk and exploitative hiring policies. In addition, the results of the study found that the extended approach was effective and efficient in evaluating the sustainability risk factors in supply chain management of the manufacturing firms. Originality/value: Three aggregation methods based on the normalization techniques are discussed. A DNMA method is proposed under intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). To propose a broad procedure for identifying and classifying sustainability risk factors (ESFs) in supply chain management.

International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,"Purpose: Increasing pressure from the stakeholders makes the inclusion and evaluation of sustainable practices in the service supply chain (SSC) inevitable. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the sustainability status of a case organization and discover the barrier to sustainability in the SSC. Design/methodology/approach: From the literature review, five sustainability dimensions, seventeen attributes and sixty-five subattributes of the SSC are identified. A three-level conceptual model drawn on human perception is developed. The overall sustainability status of the SSC is determined by using the multigrade fuzzy logic approach. The fuzzy concept incorporated helps in overcoming the challenges of vagueness and impreciseness in the responses. The case SSC is a WestIndia–based hospital. Findings: The study evaluates the case hospital to be “very sustainable” but far from the “extremely sustainable” level. Six barriers are identified which are reduction in solid waste, compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, water usage efficiency, training and education of employees, return on investment and safety equipment for employees. These barriers hinder the hospital from achieving an “extremely sustainable” level. Practical implications: This paper evaluates, helps the management in identifying the barriers and thus enabling them to work upon these barriers and achieve a greater level of sustainability. Originality/value: The sustainability practices adopted in this paper for the evaluation of the sustainability status of the SSC have not been used in previous studies. In this study apart from environmental, social and economic aspects, customer management and health, safety and risk management are also incorporated for evaluating the performance of the SSC which makes this study unique.

Industrial Management and Data Systems,"Purpose: Market uncertainties require organizations to consistently revisit their product portfolio. Theoretically the link between corporate strategy, supply chain and operations for Product Deletion (PD) decisions is lacking. The purpose of this study is to develop a decision support tool that enables managers to evaluate PD decisions across business, supply chain strategies and customer considerations; rationalizing product portfolio variety while realizing long-term organizational competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to formalize PD decision-making across multiple functional strategy perspectives. Manufacturing, supply chain, finance and marketing functions are included along with incorporating multiple stakeholder voices from multiple organizational levels—including top-management team members, cross-functional managers and customers. A case study application is conducted using an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) perspective. Findings: The interrelationships between business, supply chain strategies and customer requirements are identified, along with tensions and tradeoffs using a series of “houses” or relationship matrices. The methodology provides managers with a decision support tool that can be flexible and applicable to aid sound PD decision-making incorporating multiple stakeholders. Originality/value: Product decisions at the decline stage—for example product retirement or deletion—are neglected both in research and in practice. Having a formalized systematic process can make PD outcomes more objective. The proposed QFD approach is one of the early PD decision support tools—products can be deleted for strategic, operational and customer-related reasons, and the hierarchical interrelationships among various reasons need to be carefully managed to ensure sound product portfolio rationalization.","Golrizgashti S., Zhu Q., Sarkis J.",Formalizing the strategic product deletion decision: incorporating multiple stakeholder views,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126324573&doi=10.1108%2fIMDS-07-2021-0435&partnerID=40&md5=f436617e8aa2a9f36b30ded53ceb0226

During the decision to outsource and consider third-party logistics service provider selection, decision-makers need to pay more attention to certain critical outsourcing factors such as coordination, integration and cooperation as these key factors are essential to improve overall supply chain performance. The main purpose of this work is to identify the inter-relations among outsourcing decision factors to highlight the most important and influential factors that should be considered and carefully thought through when making outsourcing sustainable decisions. Design/methodology/approach: A two-phased methodology has been used in this study. In the first phase, outsourcing decision factors are identified from existing literature and validated by decision-makers from industry and academia. To understand the influential strength and build a sustainable model, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method is used. A courier company in the UAE is considered for implementation. Findings: All identified and validated factors are segregated into two categories (cause and effect). The result shows that the most influential factors are developing strategic alliances, uncertainty and risk mitigation and deficiency of internal resources for a service. Practical implications: There are several insights for industry managers and practitioners. The results of the study may help practitioners and logistics managers to make the logistics service sustainable and more efficient for businesses. Originality/value: This study focusses on a courier company to understand the interdependencies among outsourcing decision factors; this is unique in this field of literature.","Khan S.A., Alkhatib S., Ammar Z., Moktadir M.A., Kumar A.",Benchmarking the outsourcing factors of third-party logistics services selection: analysing influential strength and building a sustainable decision model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114695667&doi=10.1108%2fBIJ-03-2020-0121&partnerID=40&md5=bd246b41dfa0ac7768c7a8b6f02acdb4
Global Business and Finance Review,"Purpose: Over the past two decades, sustainable development and green economy approaches have been implemented in different fields, including supply chain management. In developed countries, sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has attracted attention from both academia and industry. However, there is a substantial knowledge gap about supply chain social sustainability in developing countries. Hence, the main purpose of this study is to present the link between social sustainability and economic performance with the mediating role of operational performance in sustainable supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: The PLS-SEM model is applied to identify factors affecting social sustainability and the relationship between social sustainability, operational performance, and economic performance in Vietnam. Findings: The study broadens the concept and emphasizes the importance of sustainable development in the context of Vietnam and provides recommendations for managers on strategic planning and developing business towards sustainability. This study also encourages managers to enrich employees’ welfare and working conditions and contribute to the local community. Research limitations/implications: The social indicators in developing countries are distinct from those in developed countries. Hence, this study may only apply in the context of developing countries. There are three main pillars of sustainable development, including economic (profit), environment (planet), and society (people). In this research, the author only examines the social and economic aspects. Originality/value: The outcomes of this study demonstrate a clear link between the social and economic elements of sustainability. While demonstrating how fully implemented Social sustainability improves economic performance, this study stimulates academic research about the interrelationship of sustainability elements in supply chains.",Duong N.-H.,"Relationship of Social Sustainability, Operational Performance and Economic Performance in Sustainable Supply Chain Management",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137344740&doi=10.17549%2fgbfr.2022.27.4.47&partnerID=40&md5=06fd0af6cbfb9f9250afd756ae974641
International Journal of Logistics Management,"Purpose: Pharmaceutical donations are a practical approach to increase medicine availability during disasters such as disease outbreaks. However, often donated pharmaceuticals are inappropriate and unsuitable. This convergence of inappropriate pharmaceuticals is a severe operational challenge and results in environmental hazards. This study explores the pharmaceutical supply chains (PSCs) during a disease outbreak to relieve the negative impact of the material convergence problem (MCP). Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a situation-actors-process learning-action-performance (SAP-LAP) linkage framework to understand the PSC dynamics. The problem-solving component of the SAP-LAP analysis provides the strategies catering to MCP. The findings from the SAP-LAP helped to develop the causal loop diagram (CLD). This study conducts several experiments on the proposed strategies by integrating CLD into a stock and flow diagram. Later, a disease outbreak case study accessed the pharmaceutical donations effect on PSC performance. Findings: The study synthesises and evaluates propositions and strategies to incorporate circular economy (CE) principles in PSC. This study proposed two strategies; one to sort and supply and the other to sort, supply and resell. The reuse policy improves humanitarian organisations' finances in the simulation study. This study verified the operational improvement of PSC by reducing the transport and storage burden due to MCP. Originality/value: This study comprehensively approaches the issue of drug donation and uniquely produced several propositions for incorporating a CE perspective in PSC. The study also proposed a unique simulation approach to model the donation arrivals in response to a disease outbreak using susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered modelling.","Patil A., Madaan J., Shardeo V., Charan P., Dwivedi A.",Material convergence issue in the pharmaceutical supply chain during a disease outbreak,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118562805&doi=10.1108%2fIJLM-11-2020-0425&partnerID=40&md5=b96b96ea5d26fb0e3f271281c28913b3
International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management,"Purpose: Ports are a significant link in a global supply chain and an economic entity that contributes to the country's economy. India has around 200 ports along its coastline of about 8,000 Km, yet none of them perform at par with many Asian ports. In the Indian port system, cargo throughput and the turnaround time (TAT) of ships calling at ports constitute the most significant performance measures. These performance metrics do not integrate sustainability measures such as emission levels and energy consumed. The draft is a constraint in many ports and ships visit with less than full shipload cargo. The TAT for such vessels may be lower, but the emission per ton of cargo carried is higher compared to a ship with full shipload cargo. Many ports have old or poorly maintained equipment. This state of equipment increases pollution and consumption of energy. In this paper, an attempt has been made to address the issue of undesirable and right outputs simultaneously in an Indian port system. This paper proposes a framework to ensure zero defects in Indian port operations and a port-sustainability-index to measure sustainable services in Indian ports. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used data envelopment analysis (DEA) to show that all private terminals did not perform efficiently and contradicted the notion of Indian policymakers that privatization will lead to an increase in performance levels. A literature review was carried out to identify the dimensions and factors that affect ports' performance. A case study of a major port in India and expert group discussion was done to ascertain the views of stakeholders on deficiencies in the system. The authors complemented this approach with sentiment analysis of opinions expressed by stakeholders over a while, using SentiStrength analysis software (Thelwell, 2010, 2012). The authors used the combined findings to develop the port-sustainability-index (PSI), identify the research question, and develop an ontology of the port system. The authors use the concepts of ontology-design-pattern (ODP) and logistics-service-map (Glöckner et al., 2014; Glöckner and Ludwig, 2016, 2017), opinion mining (Pang and Lee, 2008) and competency questions (Glöckner and Ludwig, 2017) to develop a port system map followed by the identification of critical elements; and the flows (physical and information flow) that gets disrupted due to defects in the system. The ontology led to the identification of competencies and capabilities a port needs to possess. Based on these identification process competency questions were drawn, and the authors identified the plausible defects that port may encounter. The authors suggested the sustainability metrics for monitoring port performance and policy changes based on the competency questions, defects, and mitigation plans. Findings: The authors introduced four KPIs, namely, port-sustainability-index (PSI), load factor (lx and ly), draft ratio (dr), and turnaround-time ratio (TATR). The authors suggested significant policy changes for Indian ports. These included –(1) Introduction of virtual arrival (VA) policy, reducing randomness in the system by pre-scheduling arrivals and activities. (2) Redefining economic life of equipment and machinery in terms of expenditure, income and desired levels of output. (3) Pricing port charges based on stakeholders’ ability and willingness to pay. The port needs to declare its productivity levels and frame their charges accordingly. (4) The ports need to frame an output-oriented privatization policy where it specifies the growth of the port. (5) Framing vessel pricing policy where a vessel may pay tax for the use of non-clean fuel or a get discount for bringing higher parcel load. (6) Levy lower port charges for the shipper for transporting cargo by rail and barges. (7) Introduce a differential pricing system where port levies lower charges for export cargo compared to import load. Research limitations/implications: The research work can be extended to develop a simulation model to carry out policy experimentations concerning the improvement of performance and carry out sustainable operations. Alternatively, researchers may develop a multi-criteria optimization model to determine the best course of action, keeping the objective function as minimization of PSI value. Practical implications: This paper provides the means to the Indian ports to remain competitive, lower emission levels and energy consumption, and optimize emission per ton of cargo handled in the port. Social implications: Society significantly benefits from this study as it recommends ways to minimize pollution that has a significant impact on human lives. Besides, the measures suggested in the paper will lower the cost of exports and imports, enhancing the real income of consumers. Originality/value: The area of sustainable port operations has previously been under-researched in the Indian context. Authors contribute to the sustainable port operation literature by suggesting a port-sustainability-index, a framework to assess the defects in port operation and development of a port-ontology for further research in the area of a port system.","Sinha D., Roy Chowdhury S.",A framework for ensuring zero defects and sustainable operations in major Indian ports,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082936934&doi=10.1108%2fIJQRM-02-2019-0062&partnerID=40&md5=70de1e5540c88477a2467c565cee7f23
Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,"Purpose: Poultry production supply chains produce substantial wastes that are transformable into favorable environmental outcomes and profitable products. While overwhelming evidence supports this conclusion, scant literature is available on how such transformations are doable. Using systems dynamics, this study addresses this research gap in a national (Bangladesh) context. This study aims to contribute an integrated model for poultry supply chains that incorporate reverse flows of wastes using system dynamics (SD) engineering with empirical simulations. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies SD and simulations of alternative supply chains with versus without reverse loops that transform wastes into viable products in poultry production and downstream marketing operations. This research reports on an in-depth case study of systems thinking and use of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology systems dynamics software. Data for the study are longitudinal and come from written operation records and extensive, repeated, one-on-one Interview from a large poultry plant operation in Bangladesh. Findings: This study finds that several current poultry waste production problems are solvable through an integrated approach that generates viable new marketable products with substantial profitable opportunities that also contributes to reductions in industrial pollution. This study confirms that forward, backward and reverse supply chains need to be under one umbrella system to achieve economic, social and environmental benefits. Research limitations/implications: This study’s SD model and outputs need additional applications in poultry supply chains in multiple countries. Applying the firm-level model that this study provides is a necessary but insufficient step toward empirical confirmation through replicating.","Shamsuddoha M., Quaddus M.A., Woodside A.G.",Environmental sustainability through designing reverse logistical loops: case research of poultry supply chains using system dynamics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112136828&doi=10.1108%2fJBIM-02-2021-0119&partnerID=40&md5=d573ff49c28283d38975eab03ac89f91
International Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Purpose: Pressured by various stakeholder groups to improve the sustainability performance of their emerging economy suppliers, multinational firms continue to expand their supplier monitoring. Leveraging the strategy literature on alliances and the buyer-supplier relationship management literature, the authors propose that a buyer firm's efforts to proactively develop cultural sensitivity and operations cognizance to understand the operational culture and routines of its suppliers can ameliorate some shortcomings of supplier monitoring, thereby improving the performance of the buyer firm. Design/methodology/approach: Using primary survey data from a sample of US manufacturing firms, combined with secondary data of supplier monitoring and financial performance, this research examines the relationship between supplier monitoring, cultural sensitivity, operations cognizance, and buyer firm performance. Findings: Supplier monitoring was associated with positive but diminishing returns for financial and sustainability performance for the buyer. Second, increasing cultural sensitivity and operations cognizance for suppliers in emerging economies were associated with improved buyer performance. Finally, the synergistic use of supplier monitoring and operations cognizance was associated with improved buyer firm financial performance. Originality/value: While the buyer-supplier relationship literature has mainly treated organizational differences between dyadic supply chain partners as exogenous to the context in which their relationship evolves, the authors posit that buyer firms' efforts to understand such differences can affect the value of buyer-directed interactions, such as supplier monitoring. This research adds to the theoretical understanding of the process of developing relational mechanisms with emerging economy suppliers. In particular, efforts of buyer firms to better understand the operational culture and routines of their suppliers can complement monitoring and are associated with a positive impact on performance.","Shafiq A., Johnson P.F., Klassen R.D.","Building synergies between operations culture, operational routines, and supplier monitoring: implications for buyer performance",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127594953&doi=10.1108%2fIJOPM-03-2021-0149&partnerID=40&md5=e0ca8995c84de3fabceeb6ea7d9f605d
Benchmarking,"Purpose: Reverse supply chain (RSC) is one of the ways to handle product returns efficiently. Recovery of residual value from product returns also helps in achieving sustainability. Its successful implementation requires coordination among all the channel members involved in the activities, from the acquisition to collection to the disposition of returned products.

Theory, context and methodology (TCM) framework of the literature review is used to identify the research gaps for future research directions. Findings: This study identifies the characteristics of RSC coordination. It includes channel structures; coordination mechanisms; performance measuring parameters; the methodology applied and explored industries. The review shows that game-theoretical modeling in RSC coordination is the most commonly used method to coordinate the channels. It was found that issues like disruption, fairness and corporate social responsibility are not explored in-depth and offer much potential for future research.

Benchmarking,"Purpose: Scarcity of resources and ever-changing customer demand has driven the manufacturing organization to opt for an integrated sustainable-green-lean-six sigma-agile manufacturing system (ISGLSAMS). The purpose of this study is to identify and rank the various drivers for the adoption of ISGLSAMS for the more sustainable development of the industries. Design/methodology/approach: Using a survey questionnaire, data were collected for the 14 ISGLSAMS drivers, identified through the literature review, from 108 Indian manufacturing industries. The sign test is used to check the relevance and significance of drivers. ISGLSAMS drivers are ranked based on the median and standard deviation. A multiple regression model was employed to investigate the effects of other drivers on the highest-ranked driver to strengthen the understanding of the drivers. Findings: Competition, customer demand, technological changes, supply chain pressure, cost benefits, incentives, top management commitment and future legislation are found the strongest drivers for ISGLSAMS. For administering the competition for ISGLSAMS policymakers must focus on the availability of organization resources, customer demand, future legislation, incentives, supply chain pressure and technological developments.

International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,"Purpose: Social Organisational Life Cycle Assessment (SO-LCA) is a methodology to evaluate the social and socio-economic aspects of the activities of a whole organisation (or a portion of it) from a life cycle perspective. Although introduced in 2015 and outlined in the Guidelines for Social Life Cycle Assessment of Products and Organisations 2020, SO-LCA is still poorly applied. This work is an attempt to implement SO-LCA and analyse the correlations between Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) and SO-LCA. Method: SO-LCA was implemented starting from an existing S-LCA case study. The social performance of the companies involved in the supply chain of the analysed product line was assessed through Subcategory Assessment Method considering Workers, Local Community, Consumers and Value Chain Actors stakeholders. Then, the emerged correlations from the S-LCA and SO-LCA case studies were discussed. Results and discussion: SO-LCA and S-LCA have many similarities on a methodological level, although they are different with regard to the scope of the analysis. This work shows that although the distinction between the two methodologies is clear from a theoretical point of view, when implementing the existing differences are blurred. Indeed, as expected, SO-LCA results might not be different from those of S-LCA when the following conditions are met: the product portfolio includes the product already assessed in an S-LCA case study; the defined system boundaries are the same as well as the organisations involved in the considered processes, and the same Reference Scale Approach is used to assess both S-LCA and SO-LCA. Conclusions: SO-LCA results should be verified when the study is conducted with different methodological choices compared to those of the previous S-LCA case study. Further development should give attention on understanding how and to what extent a different study setup could bring to results different from those of S-LCA.","D’Eusanio M., Tragnone B.M., Petti L.",Social Organisational Life Cycle Assessment and Social Life Cycle Assessment: different twins?

International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,"Purpose: Supply chain network is complicated to manage due to the involvement of a number of agents. Formation of virtual organization using Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is an approach to improve the efficiency and effectiveness and to overcome the complexities of the channel. However, the task of managing the channel further becomes complicated after incorporating sustainability into the supply chain. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on designing of mechanism and demonstration of I4.0-based virtual organization to coordinate sustainable supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, we model and compare I4.0-based virtual organization models using four other traditional contracts with centralized supply chain. The non-cooperative game theoretic approach has been used for the analysis of models. Findings: Our game-theoretic analysis shows that investment in I4.0 and sustainable innovation are beneficial for the overall supply chain. Our results show that linear two-part tariff contract and I4.0-based virtual organization model can perfectly coordinated with the supply chain.

Journal of Asia Business Studies,"Purpose: Supply chains’ (SCs’) sustainability practices and recovery strategies are attaining popularity in academia and industries to improve the resilience of the SCs and to manage large-scale disruptions. The global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 has raised the question of the sustainability of essential health-care products’ SCs of Bangladesh. It is an essential avenue for making the life of people safe and secure. Despite its importance, most of the health-care SCs in Bangladesh are struggling to meet the demand of its nation due to capacity shortage, technological backwardness of the manufacturers, delivery capacity shortages and less advanced forecasting capabilities. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the key performance indicators (KPIs) of a sustainable recovery strategy in the context of health-care SCs considering the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a dynamic method named graph theory and matrix approach to evaluate the most critical KPIs of a sustainable recovery strategy in the context of Bangladeshi health-care SCs.

Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: Sustainability approaches across product supply chains are well-known, while similar knowledge on transport supply chains (TSC) is limited. The purpose of this paper is to explore sustainability approaches and managerial challenges in extending sustainability across a TSC. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a case study of a TSC with a shipper, a third-party logistics firm and a hauler. Each actor’s views on sustainability-related communication and relations with other TSC actors are analyzed through the lens of agency theory. Findings: Each dyad in the TSC reveals different, more or less collaboration-based approaches. Challenges are revealed, including the lack of shipper understanding for the TSC context and the use of immature contracts, which disincentivizes sustainability compliance. The multi-tier study object reveals the silencing of distant actors and the need for actors to take on mediating roles to bridge information asymmetries. Research limitations/implications: Combining literature perspectives (relations, communication and agency theory) provides a deeper understanding of the approaches applied and identifies different challenges. The inclusion of agency theory reveals principal problems such as information asymmetries between agents and less-informed principals and suggests complementary labels of supply chain actors.

Benchmarking,"Purpose: Sustainability is a very important factor to be considered in the supply chain (SC) of any industry. Agricultural industry needs to be addressed even more importantly with the tools of sustainability as it concerns the life of millions. This paper explores the critical barriers (CBs) in the sustainable supply chains (SSCs) of makhana industry located in the northern part of India and seeks to design a model for the researchers and the managers who want to work in this industry. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, the CBs were identified with the help of an extensive literature review of sustainability in SCs for agri-industry and discussion with makhana industry experts (consisting of managers and senior managers) and academicians (consisting of professors and research scholars). The study uses the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique, namely interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and fuzzy ISM to develop the model. The study finally validates the model using Matrice d'impacts croisés multiplication appliquée á un classment (MICMAC) analysis. Findings: The obtained results indicate that, in the SSC of makhana industry, the role of “Lack of adoption of organic agricultural management techniques” (CB2), “Lack of modern techniques (CB4)”, “Multiple intermediaries” (CB5), “Weak socio-economic conditions” (CB7) and “Lack of proper knowledge” (CB1) are very significant. These barriers are needed to be addressed first as they have the highest driving power and other barriers are directly driven by these CBs. Research limitations/implications: The paper has included seven experts, and the interrelationship between CBs has been developed on the basis of their knowledge and discussion, so the results may be a little bias. Moreover, the paper has obtained the results using the ISM and fuzzy ISM by considering ten CBs; the researchers can explore this research by including more CBs and validate the results using other MCDM techniques like fuzzy-decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), fuzzy-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Best Worst Method (BWM).

British Food Journal,"Purpose: Sustainable food practices have been recognised as a key issue in efforts to improve and report sustainable tourism practices, given the importance of the social, environmental and economic impacts of the food industry throughout its entire chain of production – from farm to fork. From this standpoint, the aim of the present paper is to propose a comprehensive framework for reporting or making decisions concerning sustainable food management in hotels, taking into account the various facets of the food supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: Several dimensions are proposed for dealing with sustainable food management, involving all aspects of food supply chains that may be relevant for hotel decision-making. Furthermore, some key criteria for creating and using indicators of different types (qualitative and quantitative) to address these various dimensions of sustainable food management are suggested. Subsequently, the proposed framework is validated with the sustainability criteria and indicators provided by the top eight hotel groups, according to the 2019 SAM Annual Corporate Sustainability Assessment. Findings: Hotels neglect a number of aspects of sustainable food management identified in the framework. The quality and the quantity of the information provided by hotels are limited.

Management Decision,"Purpose: Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices and policies are necessary for businesses that seek to take part in international markets and ensure any form of competitiveness. Over time, and especially in the recent past, researchers, governments, and other policymakers have made use of broad and systematic approaches and come to appreciate the value-enhancing activities of sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: Businesses have embraced the integration of sustainable policies and practices within the supply chain as a critical step in ensuring the efficiency of their operations. It is clear in previous studies and operational programs of enterprises that SSCM practices accord businesses certain benefits including improving their environmental, social, and economic performance, and increasing their ecological awareness by way of influencing performance elements within supply networks in enterprises. The study examines the factors influencing performance and theories of SSCM using a neutrosophic method in the textile industry. Findings: SSCM performance is thus of great importance in ensuring business success and competitiveness, realizing customer satisfaction, and leaving the environment in a desirable state for future generations. Performance management, by assisting in the decision-making by managers and ensuring an adequate level of internal interaction, is an integral part of assimilating sustainability management into businesses.

Journal of Enterprise Information Management,"Purpose: The “Internet of Things (IoT)” is a platform for involving smart devices via the Internet at a worldwide scale. It supports the “supply chain (SC)” and “information and communication technology (ICT)” infrastructure to be well integrated into an organization and externally with customers and suppliers. The “sustainable supply chain (SSC)” is currently unavoidable if a company seeks to satisfy the aggressive change in its customers' requirements. Numerous studies have confirmed that manufacturing firms have to accelerate the shift of their focus toward sustainability and the implementation of novel technologies, such as IoT, to accomplish their organizational goals most effectively. Although the literature consists of many theoretical approaches to IoT and numerous studies that have extremely concentrated upon the IoT technology and its potential applications, it lacks research with a focus on the challenges that arise when applying IoT to the “sustainable supply chain management (SSCM)”. Design/methodology/approach: The present study proposes an integrated framework using the “Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC)” and “VlseKriterijumska optimizcija I kaompromisno resenje in Serbian (VIKOR)” models and employs to evaluate the IoT challenges to implement the SSCM. For estimating the criteria weights, the CRITIC tool is utilized. The organization's prioritization is obtained by the VIKOR procedure, which delivers simple mathematical procedures with precise and consistent outcomes. Findings: To exhibit the practicality of the introduced model, a case study is taken to evaluate the IoT challenges to implement the SSCM within the “q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets (q-ROFSs)” environment. Moreover, the authors exhibit a sensitivity investigation over given parameter values, examining the stability of developed approach. Finally, the authors draw attention to a comparison between developed q-ROF-CRITIC-VIKOR decision-making approach with an existing q-ROF-TOPSIS method to show its superiority and potency. Originality/value: The outcome of the study lies in observing the top benefits of individual businesses, and their entire SSCs can be found by implementing IoT. This paper investigates the most important challenges that individual firms and entire SSCs might while applying IoT. It provides a deep insight regarding the effects of IoT upon SSCM and the issues every firm need to contemplate when it is to apply IoT solutions.","Yang K., Duan T., Feng J., Mishra A.R.",Internet of things challenges of sustainable supply chain management in the manufacturing sector using an integrated q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy-CRITIC-VIKOR method,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116495855&doi=10.1108%2fJEIM-06-2021-0261&partnerID=40&md5=9a343399e8b50867f5a4277d251d5777
International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,"Purpose: The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their 169 targets pose the most important framework for sustainable development worldwide. However, the contributions of products and companies to the SDGs using social and environmental life cycle assessment (S-LCA; E-LCA) have not been thoroughly addressed in the scientific literature. The purpose of this research is therefore to identify product-related targets, derive suitable indicators and develop a social life cycle impact assessment (S-LCIA) method. Methods: To systematically select product-related targets, two questions are developed. The questions ask whether a product (a) has a direct impact on the achievement of the target or (b) if the companies along the life cycle that produce or offer the product have a direct influence on the achievement of the respective target. Suitable indicators are derived and adapted from generally accepted frameworks such as the Global Indicator Framework (GIF-SDG). To develop an S-LCIA method, the targets are translated into conditions beneficial or damaging to the achievement of the target to estimate the socio-economic impact of the product using a scale from +1 to −1. In cases where the targets remain vague, a systematic five-step approach to derive a quantifiable target involving five steps is applied. Results and discussion: The main contribution of this paper is to propose a coherent method to measure the contribution of products to the targets. All 17 SDGs and 61 of the 169 targets (36%) were evaluated as product-related. For 57% of the product-related targets, indicators from the GIF-SDGs could at least partly be used after slight adaptations, while for the remaining 43% of the product-related targets, indicators were taken from other frameworks or sources or had to be added. In total, 45 indicators have been identified to be suitable for assessing the potential contribution of products to the 61 targets. To illustrate the systematic five-step approach to quantitatively assess the contribution of products to the targets, five types of contribution functions are presented in detail. Conclusions: The presented method allows companies to analyse their impact and that of their products on the targets both within their own company and in the supply chain. As especially the latter is increasingly demanded by supply chain laws in different countries such as France, the Netherlands or the UK, the method fills an important research gap. However, future research to examine the proposed approach, the derived indicators and the impact assessment method is strongly encouraged.","Eberle U., Wenzig J., Mumm N.",Assessing the contribution of products to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals: a methodological proposal,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132339094&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-022-02063-8&partnerID=40&md5=704ab3c5debb79d81e8861f0a78a3d4b
British Food Journal,"Purpose: The adoption of traceability systems (TS) and sustainability programs responds to different objectives among which the companies need to be considered legitimate; hence, this study aims, first, to identify what is the relationship between traceability and sustainability in the food supply chain (SC) and, second, to characterize the legitimacy-seeking purposes, i.e. moral, cogniti60ve or pragmatic-driving companies to implement TS along with sustainability initiatives. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyses the coffee SC, a globally dispersed commodity chain, where traceability initiatives usually respond to mandatory and voluntary quality standards and certifications of origin. The study involves nine cases at different stages of the coffee SC. Findings: This study provides a taxonomy of the TS applied in the coffee SC. In addition, three main approaches to traceability for sustainability are found in the coffee SC: synergistic, complementary or disconnected. Findings also reveal how traceability responds to different legitimacy-seeking objectives while triggering or complementing sustainability practices. Five research propositions and related directions for further investigations are elaborated from the results of our study.

"Journal of Engineering, Design and Technology","Purpose: The advancements in internet technologies and the use of sophisticated digital devices in supply chain operations incessantly generate enormous amounts of data, which is termed as big data (BD). The BD technologies have brought about a paradigm shift in the supply chain decision-making towards profitability and sustainability. The aim of this work is to address the issue of implementation of the big data analytics (BDA) in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) by identifying the relevant factors and developing a structural model for this purpose. Design/methodology/approach: Through a comprehensive literature review and experts’ opinion, the crucial factors are found using the PESTEL framework, which covers political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal factors. The structural model is developed based on the results of the total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) procedure and MICMAC analysis. Findings: The policy support regarding IT, culture of data-based decision-making, inappropriate selection of BDA technologies and the laws related to data security and privacy are found to affect most of the other factors. Also, the company’s vision towards environmental performance and willingness for material and energy optimization are found to be crucial for the environmental and social sustainability of the supply chain. Research limitations/implications: The study is focused on the manufacturing supply chain in emerging economies. It may be extended to other industry sectors and geographical areas. Also, additional factors may be included to make the model more robust. Practical implications: The proposed model imparts an understanding of the relative importance and interrelationship of factors. This may be useful to managers to assess their strengths and weaknesses and ascertain their priorities in the context of their organization for developing a suitable investment plan. Social implications: The study establishes the importance of BDA for conservation and management of energy and material. This is crucial to develop strategies for enhancing eco-efficiency of the supply chain, which in turn enhances the economic returns for the society. Originality/value: This study addresses the implementation of BDA in SSCM in the context of emerging economies. It uses the PESTEL framework for identifying the factors, which is a comprehensive framework for strategic planning and decision-making.

Greening of Industry Networks Studies,"Purpose: The aim of this chapter is to explore the extendibility of sustainability compliance throughout the supply chain of food in Egypt. The research examines the usability of different governance mechanisms by multinational companies (MNCs) to upgrade their suppliers’ sustainability compliance. The study also explores factors that enable or constrain the ability of MNCs to extend their sustainability policy throughout the supply chain. Finally, a product versus process perspective will be tackled to differentiate between sustainability standards that appear in the product features and those detected only by monitoring the production process.Methodology/Approach/Design: The study applies the multiple-case study method, where four case companies from the Egyptian food industry were interviewed. The findings reveal that MNCs in Egypt tend to rely more on the contractual mechanism with their suppliers and focus on quality more than sustainability standards.Findings: The results demonstrate the MNCs’ lack of responsibility awareness toward their suppliers operating in a country like Egypt with less rigorous legal standards concerned with sustainability. MNCs are generally concentrating on the economic benefits yielded by the relational mechanism followed with their suppliers; on the other hand, there is an obvious negligence of the potential noneconomic benefits that the companies can reap from a sustainable supply chain.",Elhenawy Y.M.,Governance Mechanisms Used by MNCs for Egypt’s Suppliers’ Sustainability Compliance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124517952&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-78791-2_13&partnerID=40&md5=12f99a5a20ce1924289f96384e5302ea
British Food Journal,"Purpose: The aim of this research was to explore the mechanisms underpinning open innovation (OI) success and its sustainability in agrifood businesses. First, the authors explored the importance of 4.0 technologies in data collection from crowds, subsequently examining how new technologies might drive forward the development of collaborative strategies with suppliers. Reductions in resource wasting were observed. The role of 4.0 technologies in increasing supply chain sustainability overall was the main focus of the study. Design/methodology/approach: This research builds on a single inductive case study method. The authors performed an in-depth analysis of data from an Italian agritech distributor. Data – aside from multiple semi-structured interviews – were collected via several different sources. The results have been summarized in an integrated holistic conceptual framework. Findings: The findings show that 4.0 technologies allow for swift information exchanges between consumers, the agritech business and suppliers. As a result, consumers might demand new products and, consequently, the agritech business can arrange new offerings with suppliers, completing the OI and shared value creation circle. Likewise, the possibility of adopting a just-in-time approach of sorts may reduce the wasting of resources. The absorptive capacities and knowledge management capabilities of the agritech business play a fundamental role in OI performance, sustainability and success.

Journal of Asia Business Studies,"Purpose: The catastrophic state of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has seized off all the operations along with the globe. It has not only distressed the socio-economic structure of the world but also mounted enormous pressure on the governmental bodies to save the lives of the people. Despite this, severe impacts of the same have been observed on the small and medium manufacturing enterprises (SMME) practices, resulting in the economic downturn. The purpose of this study is to facilitate the SMME’s with circular economy (CE) practices to overcome the negative impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on their supply chain (SC) operations. Design/methodology/approach: The presented work identified seven critical impacts as criteria of the novel COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian SMME and seeks to identify the relief measures in the CE paradigm by identifying 13 prominent enablers to CE as alternatives. Experts’ opinions have been engaged to detect CE enablers’ proficiency to overpower the pandemic impact through a questionnaire-based survey. The obtained data have been clustered and analyzed through a hybrid approach of entropy weight method and grey relational analysis to find an organized ranking of the enablers. Findings: Current work spotlights the SMME’s losses due to SC disruptions and declined consumption patterns. The waste augmentation during the pandemic era has also been grouped in this study, primarily associating with the SC’s waste generation. The result of the performed analysis shows that the CE enabler “waste reduction and its transformation into a resource (E1)” have achieved the highest rank among all the considered enablers, governing a higher demand toward reusing waste for better handling the post COVID era state of affairs.

Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: The COVID-19 crisis has created enormous strain in global supply chains. The disruption has caused severe shortages of critical items, including personal protective equipment (e.g. face masks), ventilators and diagnostics. The failure of the industry to meet the sudden demand for these necessary items has caused a severe humanitarian crisis. These situations, resulting from the COVID-19, crisis have led to the informal growth of frugal innovation in sustainable global supply chains. This paper aims to provide a detailed overview of drivers of frugal-oriented sustainable global supply chains, following lessons acquired from emerging countries’ attempts to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a focused group approach to identify the drivers and this paper further validated them using existing literature published in international peer-reviewed journals and reports. The authors adopted total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) to analyze the complex relationships among identified drivers. Findings: The authors present a theoretical framework to explain how the drivers are interlinked.

Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused irrefutable devastation globally. Yet, academic and trade commentators have claimed that this disruption could have had a silver lining by presenting the fashion industry with the opportunity to reassess and rebuild in a slower, more considered way. Part of this reassessment, some have argued, may have been allowing the industry's pre-COVID sustainability buzz to come to fruition by nudging the fashion industry to go circular. This paper explores if, and how, the COVID-19 pandemic was (not) nudging the industry towards circularity using the case study of circular textiles. Design/methodology/approach: Serial, semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with three buyers and sourcers working for three UK-based fashion retailers. Each participant was involved in three interviews in June 2020 following the UK's first national lockdown. Findings: The research findings suggest that, at the time this research was undertaken, these retailers were focussed on regaining profit, protecting their supply chains and producing “safe” designs whilst cutting back and becoming more risk averse. These actors suggested that, in contrast to the suppositions made by academic and media commentators, the COVID-19 pandemic was acting as a hindrance to circularity, not a helping hand, as retailers were less willing to invest in circular textiles at that time than they were pre-pandemic.

TQM Journal,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions and revealed the fragilities in supply chains. This crisis has re-opened the debate on supply chain resilience and sustainability. This paper aims to investigate distinct impacts of COVID-19 on supply chains. It identifies both short- and medium-to-long-term measures taken to mitigate the different effects of the pandemic and highlights potential transformations and their impacts on supply chain sustainability and resilience. Design/methodology/approach: To address the purpose of the study, a qualitative research approach based on case studies and semi-structured interviews with 15 practitioners from various supply chain types and sectors was conducted. Studied organizations included necessary and non-necessary supply chain sectors, which are differently impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: This study reveals five main challenges facing supply chains during COVID-19, including uncertain demand and supply, suppliers' concentration in specific regions, globalized supply chains, reduced visibility in the supply network, and limited supplier capacity. To help mitigate these challenges and develop both sustainability and resilience, this paper identifies some mitigating actions focusing on the promotion of the health and wellbeing of employees and supply chain stabilization. Further, in the post-COVID era, sustainable and resilient supply chains should consider regionalization of the supply chain, diversification of the supply network, agility, collaboration, visibility, and transparency; and should accelerate the use of smart technologies and circular economy practices as dynamic capabilities to improve supply chain resilience and sustainability.

In this study, the authors examine the competencies required to improve the automotive supply chain routine operations to address the parts supply crisis from multitier suppliers in the post-COVID-19 environment. The authors also propose a list of competencies required in the automotive supply chains to deploy the transparency for sustainability (TfS) framework on a long-term basis. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have adapted a cross-case study process using intervention-based research and a design science approach for use in this study and used multiple sources for data collection such as published literature, operational experience, and critical opinions of original equipment manufacturer representatives. The research design includes interviews with global OEMs practitioners as one of the relevant sources of information. Findings: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak on automotive manufacturing operations and global supply chains is unprecedented. The TfS framework cycle has been validated using the real-world semiconductor supply crisis which deals with multitier sustainable supply chain management (MTSSCM), and the authors found that there are competency gaps when compared with existing literature. The list of key competencies identified along with the formulation of design propositions to facilitate both the supply crisis and collaboration among automotive firms to enhance their business performance were also presented. Research limitations/implications: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the automobile sector significantly. This situation has created many opportunities and obstacles, but this paper only considers the automotive semi-conductor shortage situation, which may be resolved in the near future when there are more installed capacities. Therefore, it is unclear whether the proposed responses will result in long-term solutions. Further adjustments may be needed to revisit the TfS framework. The research paper only addresses the automotive side of the current supply crisis, but more sustainability issues may arise in the future, which need to be dealt with separately. Practical implications: Research findings may prove particularly interesting to global automotive vehicle manufacturers, suppliers and policy makers who are seeking to understand multitier supply networks to resolve the current challenges associated with the post-COVID-19 pandemic situation. Originality/value: In addition to contributing to developing competency requirements, this study enhances the evolving research stream of MTSSCM by linking it to wider research applications of intervention-based research coupled with design science.","Adhi Santharm B., Ramanathan U.",Supply chain transparency for sustainability – an intervention-based research approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132309098&doi=10.1108%2fIJOPM-11-2021-0684&partnerID=40&md5=651b9eeb9ec289c45b9ee374bc5500c4

Management Decision,"Purpose: The crucial action program of United Nations is sustainable development. In the context of lockdown and food supply chain disruptions in many developing countries due to COVID-19, sustainable agribusiness entrepreneurship (SAE) must be investigated to contribute to the global safe-food supply chain resilience. Furthermore, this pandemic might have changed cognitive social capital (i.e. perceived shared norms, civicness and community cohesiveness) and relational social capital (i.e. social trust). Therefore, this study aims to examine their role in forming agribusiness entrepreneurs’ SAE intentions under the lens of sustainable development in the pandemic context. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a mixed-methods approach with resources for structural equation modeling. A sample of 499 Vietnamese agribusiness entrepreneurs to reconcile scales and test hypothesized relationships. Findings: The study reconciles the existing constructs’ scales and develops a new scale measuring SAE intention. The findings show that the extended theory of planned behavior (ETPB) model is an ideal theoretical framework for predicting behavioral intentions in sustainability. The study also discovers the role of cognitive social capital and relational social capital in motivating SAE intentions. Also, some managerial implications are suggested for agribusinessmen to survive and succeed during the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is considered the first to investigate the role of cognitive social capital and relational social capital in motivating SAE in an emerging market using the ETPB.

Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal,"Purpose: The current study aims to deliver a consolidated view of environmental sustainability in cold supply chain performance systems (CSCPS), incorporating theoretical and empirical analysis for improving environmental standards. For this purpose, this study firstly aims to explore and analyze the various crucial challenging factors for environmental sustainability in the cold supply chain (CSC). Secondly, it discovers the most effective sustainable strategies for improving the environmental sustainability of CSCPS. Design/methodology/approach: The exploration of the crucial challenging factors and the proposed sustainable strategies have been done using a systematic literature review relevant to the sustainable performance of CSC. At the same time, semi-structured brainstorming sessions were conducted with the domain professionals having an industrial and academic background to finalize the strategies. Empirical analysis has been performed using an intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) based hybrid approach of SWARA and COPRAS methods. Findings: The key findings of the study address that “higher energy consumption during refrigerated transportation and storage” is the most crucial challenge for environmental sustainability in CSC. In addition, “managerial refrain to profit decline due to sustainability implementation” is the second most crucial challenge that hinders the adoption of sustainable practices in CSCs. Meanwhile, the governmental attention to motivating organizations for green adoption and implementation of solar energy-driven refrigeration technologies are the two most important discoveries of the study that might help in improving CSC's environmental performance. Research limitations/implications: From the implications side, the study enriches and extends the current literature content on CSC sustainability. In addition, it offers sound managerial implications by identifying the challenges that create threats among the management for sustainability adoption and suggesting the most suitable sustainable strategies, which may help the management to raise the environmental performance of their CSC. Besides having various important theoretical and managerial implications for the study, contemplation of only environmental sustainability traits as a broader perspective limits the scope of the study. Originality/value: The study's main contribution is the exploration of the most crucial challenges imparting obstructions in sustainable development and sustainable strategies, which may get the interest of the CSC players, market leaders, and industrial and academic practitioners working in the domain of CSC sustainability.

Journal of Asia Business Studies,"Purpose: The governments of different nations implemented various policy measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These policy measures had a negative impact towards freight transportation. Further, the shock and ripple effect on the other supply chain complicates the recovery process of freight transportation. The transformation of freight transportation in the post-COVID-19 world was reported to be unsustainable. Thus, emerged the requirement to formulate the recovery measures in the context of freight transportation. This study aims to identify and model the recovery measures for sustainable freight transportation (SFT). Design/methodology/approach: In this study, 13 critical recovery measures are established from the literature and finalized with the help of an expert panel. An integrated Grey Decision-Making trial and evaluation laboratory is used to prioritize and establish the cause-effect relationships among the identified critical recovery measures. Further, sensitivity analysis is performed to ensure the robustness of the proposed model. Findings: The present study reflects that Efficient traffic management (M13), sustainability focused policies (M2), sensitization of stakeholders (M10), financial support (M9) and adoption of 4 R practices (M12) are the top five critical recovery measures for SFT. The results highlight that the transport sector needs to retain the learning from the COVID-19 period to operate under low workforce availability. Further, the emerging economies are suggested to promote local manufacturing to reduce the lead time and risk of unavailability. The study findings reflect that attaining sustainability without considering the social dimension of sustainability is impossible.

International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,"Purpose: The implementation of sustainability and circular economy (CE) models in agri-food production can promote resource efficiency, reduce environmental burdens, and ensure improved and socially responsible systems. In this context, indicators for the measurement of sustainability play a crucial role. Indicators can measure CE strategies aimed to preserve functions, products, components, materials, or embodied energy. Although there is broad literature describing sustainability and CE indicators, no study offers such a comprehensive framework of indicators for measuring sustainability and CE in the agri-food sector. Methods: Starting from this central research gap, a systematic literature review has been developed to measure the sustainability in the agri-food sector and, based on these findings, to understand how indicators are used and for which specific purposes. Results: The analysis of the results allowed us to classify the sample of articles in three main clusters (“Assessment-LCA,” “Best practice,” and “Decision-making”) and has shown increasing attention to the three pillars of sustainability (triple bottom line). In this context, an integrated approach of indicators (environmental, social, and economic) offers the best solution to ensure an easier transition to sustainability. Conclusions: The sample analysis facilitated the identification of new categories of impact that deserve attention, such as the cooperation among stakeholders in the supply chain and eco-innovation.","Silvestri C., Silvestri L., Piccarozzi M., Ruggieri A.",Toward a framework for selecting indicators of measuring sustainability and circular economy in the agri-food sector: a systematic literature review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126063183&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-022-02032-1&partnerID=40&md5=43843f9771b4e1dc49107d718ad24907
Benchmarking,"Purpose: The literature on Maritime Transportation (MT) is experiencing a transition phase where the focus of the research is repositioning. It registered steep growth in recent years with its beginning articles on the concepts of cost minimization to the current focus on achieving sustainable operational effectiveness using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Thus, this becomes a right time to investigate the trajectory of research on MT. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed study aims to explore the potential of data analytics techniques such as data mining and network analytics to reflect the trajectory of research in the maritime supply chain over time. This study identifies the eight main dimensions of the research published under maritime paradigm through network analytics. The in-depth review of these dimensions rendered us to segregate them further into sub-dimensions for the ease of understanding and interpretability. Further, the text mining is employed to extract thematic evolution of the research. Findings: The evolved themes are completely exclusive from the conventional MT research with artificial intelligence, digital storage, waste management and biofuels emerging as contemporary themes. It is found that although there are a sufficient amount of literature on sustainable port practices but their policy implications are still underexplored. The inter-dimension research is needed to achieve the motive of economic efficiency and environmental sustainability simultaneously.

Built Environment Project and Asset Management,"Purpose: The low level of sustainable practices in the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) sector continues to increase. In driving sustainability practice adoption and implementation, construction-contracting firms have introduced sustainability practices to their supply chain network. This study examines the strategies adopted by large construction-contracting firms in Ireland to integrate sustainability practices into their supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts the mixed-method approach using questionnaires and interviews to collect data. The relative importance index (RII) was used to analyse the data collected through the questionnaire survey. In terms of theoretical underpinning, the study was positioned in the resourced-based view (RBV) theory, which focusses on the link between a firm's internal characteristics and performance. Findings: The results revealed that, in building a long-term relationship, trust, knowledge of the construction process, commitment, a common goal and mutual support were the key factors considered. While in developing their supply chain, suppliers' assessment and promoting competition in the supply chain were ranked high amongst the mechanisms utilised. Additional findings revealed that long-term relationships with a supply chain organisation have little impact on the project sustainability performance; instead, close collaboration and trust amongst the project team influenced the project sustainability performance. Research limitations/implications: The study focusses only on the main contractor's organisation. Further study will require exploring the supply chain organisations to provide a deeper understanding. Practical implications: The research demonstrates that for construction-contracting firms to contribute positively to sustainability objectives, they will have to collaborate closely with their supply chain.

Benchmarking,"Purpose: The main objective of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review (SLR) and structured insight into last mile delivery, ultimately identifying gaps in current knowledge and proposing a framework for future research direction in terms of sustainability in the area. Design/methodology/approach: This paper identifies and synthesizes information from academic journals and examines “Journals and Publishing place,” “Geographic location,” “Year of Publication,” “University and Author Affiliation,” “Themes and Sub-themes,” “Theory,” “Research Design, Methods and Area” and “Industry Involvement.” A collection of online databases from 2005 to 2020 were explored, using the keywords “Last mile delivery,” “Last mile logistics,” “Last mile transportation,” “Last mile fulfillment,” “Last mile operations” and “Last mile distribution” in their title and/or abstract and/or keywords. Accordingly, a total of 281 journal articles were found in this discipline area, and data were derived from a succession of variables. Findings: There has been significant growth in published articles concerning last mile delivery over the last 15 years (2005–2020). An in-depth review of the literature shows five dimensions of the last mile: last mile delivery, transportation, operations, distribution and logistics. Each of these dimensions is interrelated and possess clustered characteristics. For instance, last mile operations, last mile transportation and last mile delivery are operational, whereas last mile distribution is tactical, and last mile logistics possess strategic characteristics. The findings also indicate that even though the sustainability concept can be incorporated into all levels of the last mile, the current literature landscape mainly concentrates on the operational level. Research limitations/implications: This review is limited to academic sources available from Emerald Insight, Science Direct, Taylor and Francis, Springer, MDPI and IEEE containing the mentioned keywords in the title and/or abstract/or keywords. Furthermore, only papers from high-quality, peer-reviewed journals were evaluated. Other sources such as books and conference papers were not included. Practical implications: This study dissects last mile delivery to produce a framework that captures and presents its complex characteristics and its interconnectedness with various related components. By analyzing last mile delivery in its entirety, the framework also helps practitioners pinpoint which levels of last mile delivery (operation, tactical or strategic) they can incorporate the concept of sustainability.

Having conducted a comprehensive literature search in electronic databases Google Scholar, Emerald Insight, ScienceDirect and ProQuest, 69 articles were selected and reviewed. A case of the Kering Group was used to explain the results. Findings: This paper highlighted the basic concepts of a sustainable supply chain, reviewed the 10 principles of the United Nation Global Compact and their connections to promoting supply chain sustainability, as well as the three components of a sustainable supply chain: green supply chain, transparent supply chain and circular supply chain. Based on the results of a SLR and a real case of Kering Group, the paper identified 12 innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain: (1) biodegradable and natural materials, (2) textile recycling, (3) nearshoring, (4) artificial intelligence (AI), (5) robot, (6) 3D printing, (7) Internet of Things, (8) blockchain, (9) reverse resources; (10) bio-packaging, (11) augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and (12) digital runway. Research limitations/implications: The epidemiological situations of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding innovative ideas for a sustainable supply chain may change over time. While this paper provides a comprehensive literature review and case study, further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of current efforts in the development of a sustainable fashion supply chain through collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Practical implications: Embracing the issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of this study are further explained by the case of Kering Group in the fashion industry. The managerial implications of the results and discussion are the need to adopt innovative ideas for a more sustainable fashion supply chain in the future. The success of sustainable supply chains work by leveraging the best available technologies such as robot, 3D printing, AR and VR, setting consistent standards for sustainability such as Environmental Profit and Loss and Kering & Textile Exchange and communicating with all parties throughout the supply chain, such as blockchain and AI. Investment in developing technology and innovative ideas will be the key of future to supply chain sustainability. Nonetheless, the specific approach used by each organization must be tailored to its characteristics, goals and circumstances. Social implications: Bringing upon unprecedented challenges, the pandemic has shown both companies and consumers just how fragile our planet is. Thus, to protect our planet in the long run, we need to not only make businesses more sustainable but also live more eco-friendly lifestyles.

Benchmarking,"Purpose: The objective of this paper is to synthesise the published literature on consumer awareness and acceptance of Sustainable Fashion (SF) and highlight that sustainability decisions taken across procurement, designing, manufacturing and retailing must include the consumer perspective of SF. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on sustainable fashion combined with consumer behavior was conducted. The study approach involved descriptive analysis, content analysis and theoretical analysis in the first section. The later sections focus on sustainability practices across the apparel supply chain that can foster acceptance of sustainable fashion. Findings: In this review paper, five solutions that are typically used for leveraging consumer awareness and acceptance towards sustainable fashion are identified from the latest research papers: (1) attention to micro-sensitive factors (2) shared responsibilities (3) repositioning sustainable fashion for larger audience (4) positioning conscious fashion and (5) unified approach. These solutions are proposed as most important for achieving success in sustainable production and sustainable consumption (SPSC) for the fashion industry. Further, suggestions for how to embed sustainability related business decisions across sourcing, designing, manufacturing, distribution and recollection and retailing are also provided. Practical implications: Through this research, a clear view emerges of the progression of publication and where future research should be directed to popularise sustainable fashion among consumers. Research findings and proposed solutions will be valuable inputs for brand managers, marketers and retailers as they conceive new plans and make decisions about addressing sustainability challenges in textile and apparel manufacturing firms. Originality/value: This is a first of its kind of study on sustainable fashion that highlights the importance of understanding consumer behaviour in influencing sustainability decisions required across sourcing, designing, manufacturing and retailing to achieve substantial economic advantages in the fashion industry. End-to-end supply chain processes (i.e. procurement, design, manufacturing, marketing and retailing) are considered to identify several factors that influence consumer behavior in favor of sustainable fashion throughout the supply chain.","Sinha P., Sharma M., Agrawal R.",A systematic review and future research agenda for sustainable fashion in the apparel industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138924873&doi=10.1108%2fBIJ-02-2022-0142&partnerID=40&md5=f1cc39c7567767e1f81d12719f184c00
International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,"Purpose: The olive oil sector in Italy has a significant socio-economic, environmental, and cultural relevance. However, the environmental impacts of production and consumption models are considerable, mainly due to the demand for large quantities of resources (fuels, chemicals) and to the environmental impacts of residues’ disposal. Due to the scarcity of resources and climate change concerns, circular economy principles based on industrial ecology concepts are emerging. In this paper, the principles of circular economy were specifically applied to the olive oil supply chain, to improve the environmental sustainability of the sector. Methods: The production chain of extra virgin olive oil was analyzed using the Life Cycle Assessment method, based on primary data from an oil farm and mill in Southern Italy. The environmental impacts were evaluated through the SimaPro software and the ReCiPe 2016 Mid-point (H) Impact Assessment Method, with reference to the functional unit of 1-L bottle of extra virgin olive oil. Some circular improvement options were investigated, comparing the impacts generated by (i) extra virgin olive oil linear production without valorization of by-products, (ii) extra virgin olive oil linear production with allocation of total impacts to co-products, and (iii) two circular production systems, incorporating improvements such as replacement of diesel with biodiesel and of electricity from the national grid with energy recovered from residues. Results and discussion: The environmental impacts of the business-as-usual production pattern were identified for possible improvements. In all phases of the production chain of organic extra virgin olive oil, the most affected impact categories were human carcinogenic toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. As expected, the major contributions to almost all the analyzed impact categories were determined by the agricultural phase (92.65%), followed by the bottling phase (7.13%) and the oil extraction phase (0.22%). The valorization of by-products was considered by widening the system boundaries to ensure the environmental sustainability by developing circular patterns that feedback waste materials to upstream steps of the same process. The environmental impacts resulted lower in almost all the impact categories, with the major benefits gained in the global warming and fossil depletion impact categories. Conclusions: The analysis proved that the reuse of pomace, prunings, and exhausted cooking oil initially considered as waste can bring benefits from an environmental point of view to the larger scale of the economy, by replacing fossil fuels, as well as to the olive oil chain itself, by providing the needed energy for production.","Ncube A., Fiorentino G., Panfilo C., De Falco M., Ulgiati S.",Circular economy paths in the olive oil industry: a Life Cycle Assessment look into environmental performance and benefits,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125650650&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-022-02031-2&partnerID=40&md5=78019514ff288a59594c9af7c82f94d2
Journal of Enterprise Information Management,"Purpose: The poor leadership style is a key obstacle to the effective implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies. To successfully apply the Industry 4.0 technologies, which can enhance the sustainability of firms, senior management needs to be inspiring and transformational. On the other hand, numerous factors can hinder the Industry 4.0 transition and “Circular Supply Chain (CSC)” transformation. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the related barriers of CSCs in the era of Industry 4.0 transition. Design/methodology/approach: The current study developed an innovative decision-making approach with the help of the “Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo)” method and “Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC)” method on the “q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets (q-ROFSs).” CRITIC in this combined method was used to predict the importance or weighting degrees of the CSCs barriers in the age of Industry 4.0 transition. Findings: The results of this study found that the absence of knowledge about the Industry 4.0 technologies and circular approaches was the first barrier followed by the problems associated with data security in relationship management in circular flows, the deficiency of knowledge regarding the data management among stakeholders and the lack of awareness about the potential benefits of autonomous systems in labor-oriented “End-of-Life (EOL)” activities for CSCs in the era of Industry 4.0 transition. Research limitations/implications: A limitation may be that despite the generalizability of the proposed framework, the results may differ when it is implemented in different sectors. By emphasizing the obstacles to sustainable operations of supply chains (SCs) in the context of circular economy (CE) and Industry 4.0, researchers working in the same domain may be encouraged to find ways to remove such obstacles in different settings. As suggested in this study, the priority of various barriers helps researchers suggest effective strategies for the sustainable development of companies within the current dynamic business atmosphere. Practical implications: The findings of this paper can aid industry practitioners in fixing their attention on the digitization or automation of their systems in the context of sustainability or resource circularity. Note that within the current context of CE, one of the crucial issues is how to conserve the existing resources; the answer to this question can save the environment. Originality/value: The current paper proposed a new multi-criteria decision-making method using q-ROFSs to analyze, rank and evaluate the CSC barriers in the age of Industry 4.0 transition. To this end, a new decision-making approach with the help of CRITIC and CoCoSo methods on q-ROFSs called q-ROF-CRITIC-CoCoSo was introduced to evaluate the CSCs barriers in the era of Industry 4.0 transition.","Shang C., Saeidi P., Goh C.F.",Evaluation of circular supply chains barriers in the era of Industry 4.0 transition using an extended decision-making approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125255770&doi=10.1108%2fJEIM-09-2021-0396&partnerID=40&md5=fed60c32e33666ea07b1db89784b145c
Journal of Global Operations and Strategic Sourcing,"Purpose: The present research paper is an attempt to study how COVID-19 can affect the global sourcing practices of various supply chain intermediaries across the demand chain. This study aims to explore and is an attempt to understand the overall impact of COVID-19 on the sustainable operations of the firm such as sourcing, procurement, economic performance, social responsibility, consumption and distributions. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quantitative technique using data collected from 708 respondents. Structural equation modeling (SEM) has been applied to test the proposed model and hypothesis. Findings: The findings of the study suggest that sourcing practices, distribution and sustainability considerations of manufacturers, suppliers, distributors and retailers are affected by COVID-19 to a great extent but the pandemic has also led to making supply chain intermediaries understand the changing dynamics of the business scenario which can help them in their own strategic and business evolution. Research limitations/implications: The current disruptions throughout global delivery chains caused by COVID-19 affect badly, the already poor-performing supply chains. Hence, the present study provides fresh insight on how organizations can limit the ill effects of COVID-19 by safeguarding some of their key sustainable operations in a post-pandemic business scenario.

Revista de Gestao,"Purpose: The purpose of the article is to demonstrate how agency theory has been used to address the dynamics involved in supply chain management. It is also dedicated to suggesting an agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach: We performed an integrative literature review, based on the process detailed by Botelho et al. (2011), with search filters. The articles were obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science databases using the keywords “supply chain” and “agency theory”, with a subsequent analytical filter for “management”. The search initially identified 205 articles. After two screenings, 56 articles were selected for analysis. Findings: Despite attempts to infer the importance of research on agency theory in supply chain management, its application to the discipline is scarce. Clearly, agency theory provides valuable insights into the relationships in the supply chain. In the studies analyzed, the dynamics of performance, risk, sustainability, dyadic and inter-firm relationships, and supplier management are predominant. Originality/value: When considering unwanted behaviors throughout the supply chain, agency theory fills the explanatory gaps for these facts.

Benchmarking,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse how a company’s orientation enables sustainable practices in its supply chains. Specifically, it focusses on how the strategic orientation of a company may stimulate new behaviours in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: Two in-depth qualitative case studies were conducted. Each company’s orientation to sustainable supply chains was studied using cross-case analysis. Findings: The organisations in this study have a market-driving (i.e. proactive) orientation instead of market-driven (i.e. responsive) behaviour. Using analysis from the process of change for sustainability and explaining some challenges faced by both organisations, findings indicate that a corporate strategy of sustainability modified the companies’ management processes, even for the company that changed its orientation during the time (i.e. sustainability was not the main strategy at first). Practical examples of actions are provided to illustrate the study’s conclusion that a corporate orientation towards sustainability is an enabling factor in developing sustainable supply chain management (SCM). Research limitations/implications: Strategic management plays an important role in a company’s orientation towards sustainability – internally and throughout its supply chains. Based on the findings, future research should measure the effect of a company’s orientation on sustainable SCM. Practical implications: This study contributes to the understanding of companies’ strategic orientations and explores ways to introduce sustainability into supply chains.

International Journal of Lean Six Sigma,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the existing knowledge system of lean supply chain management (LSCM), i.e. by using main path analysis, and the authors extract the main development track of LSCM. It is advantageous for relevant scholars to deepen their understanding of this academic field from a bibliometrics view to grasp the future directions better. Design/methodology/approach: Structuring a citation network with the processed data set containing 866 papers and relevant information collected from Web of Science (WoS). Conducting review analyses aiming at the main paths that are extracted from the above citation network. Findings: There are two different evolution paths in LSCM field, i.e. improving corporate sustainability performance through combining lean and green practices, and seeking the balance between lean and agility to structure leagile supply chain for specific industries. LSCM research studies mainly focus on five aspects: (1) establishment and development of LSCM theory; (2) structuration of lean supply chain; (3) research studies of the relationship between LSCM and corporate performance; (4) supply chain evaluation system; and (5) review and vista of LSCM field. The intersection of two knowledge evolute routes would be Industry 4.0, which is an integrated theory system combining lean, agility, green and other supply chain thinking.

Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how first-tier suppliers in multi-tier supply chains adapt their vertical and horizontal relationships to reduce the risk of slavery-like practices. Design/methodology/approach: Using Archer’s morphogenetic theory as an analytical lens, this paper presents case analyses adduced from primary and secondary data related to the development of relational anti-slavery supply capabilities in Brazilian–UK beef and timber supply chains. Findings: Four distinct types of adaptation were found among first-tier suppliers: horizontal systemisation, vertical systemisation, horizontal transformation and vertical differentiation. Research limitations/implications: This study draws attention to the socially situated nature of corporate action, moving beyond the rationalistic discourse that underpins existing research studies of multi-tier, socially sustainable, supply chain management. Cross-sector comparison highlights sub-country and intra-sectoral differences in both institutional setting and the approaches and outcomes of individual corporate actors’ initiatives. Sustainable supply chain management theorists would do well to seek out those institutional entrepreneurs who actively reshape the institutional conditions within which they find themselves situated. Practical implications: Practitioners may benefit from adopting a structured approach to the analysis of the necessary or contingent complementarities between their, primarily economic, objectives and the social sustainability goals of other, potential, organizational partners.

This study adds green innovation as mediator in the relationship between CSR and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: A model with three second-order constructs is developed and tested, in a sample of 325 managers from manufacturing companies in Ecuador, using quantitative and cross-section methods. Findings: After obtaining adjusted and validated measurement models, a structural equation model was conducted, where the main hypotheses were confirmed, providing empirical evidence that CSR and green innovation significantly influence manufacturing competitiveness in a developing economy. Research limitations/implications: This study considers only manufacturing companies in Ecuador, focusing on CSR practices in a single territorial case study. It arguably contributes to reinforce the business case for CSR, with new evidence on the causal relationships between CSR, green innovation and competitiveness, in the context of emerging market manufacturing industries. Although the literature often points at a positive relationship between CSR and firm-level competitiveness, supporting empirical evidence remains scarce. This model, introducing green innovation as mediator in the relationship between CSR and competitiveness in developing markets, accounts for a novel theoretical approach. Practical implications: The findings are consistent with previous research, reporting the positive influence of CSR activities on organizational competitiveness, reducing risks and cost structures, as well as improving the relationship with employees, enhancing talent attraction, retention and productivity. Incorporating formal CSR tools to the model allowed us to highlight the relevance of ‘green’ certifications as a means to provide a competitive edge, along with increased bargaining power in the supply chain, resulting in competitiveness gains. The findings on the role of green innovation suggest a transition from cost-savings to a more strategic leverage on responsible innovation as a source of competitive advantage. Social implications: Additionally, this research contributes to shed light on the impact of green processes and product innovations on social and environmental performance, providing evidence of a more efficient use of energy and natural resources, increasing productivity and by extension, profitability. CSR shapes an innovation culture that, through the use of social, environmental and sustainability controllers, can create new business models, products, services or processes that boost both firm-level and supply chain productivity, benefits that eventually spill over to the host community. Originality/value: This study aims at bridging the research gap on the interplay of CSR, green innovation and competitiveness in manufacturing in an emerging market context.","Padilla-Lozano C.P., Collazzo P.","Corporate social responsibility, green innovation and competitiveness – causality in manufacturing",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112575431&doi=10.1108%2fCR-12-2020-0160&partnerID=40&md5=7a6442b4a1a7a465a485b12a5a18f441
Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the key performance factors that can lead toward sustainability in the Industry 4.0 supply chains of manufacturing industries. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire is used to collect the data from manufacturing sector to prioritize the factors, which integrates both Industry 4.0 and sustainability. For this, stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method is used to obtain the weights for criteria and sub-criteria to prioritize the factors. Findings: The present study brings the findings about five key performance factors. Social factor needs much attention among all the criteria, followed by ecological, economic, information technology and dynamic capability theory. Further, change management, third-party audits and novel business models are key sub-factors to improve performance of sustainability in Industry 4.0 supply chains. Practical implications: This study prioritized the performance factors of Industry 4.0 and sustainable supply chain in Indian manufacturing sector. These prioritized factors help to improve performance of organizations, which are practicing the Industry 4.0 and sustainability practices.

Journal of Advances in Management Research,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the integrated model of the Preference Selection Index (PSI) and the prospect theory as new means to appraise the impact of supply chain sustainability risks based on five pillars of sustainability. Research has shown that sustainability risk assessment has a strong positive impact on improving the performance of enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a new decision support model for assessing supply chain sustainability risk based on additional failure mode and effect analysis parameters and its integration with PSI methodology and prospect theory. A case example of the supply chain small and medium enterprise (SME) producing fashion have been used in this study. Findings: The result of this study reveals some critical supply chain sustainability risks affecting the sustainability of enterprises under study. Research limitations/implications: The use of a limited sample is often associated as a limitation in the research studies and this study is based on findings from SMEs in the fashion retail supply chain. This preliminary study provides academics and practitioners an exemplar of supply chain sustainability risk assessment using integration of the PSI method and prospect theory. Practical implications: The result of this study is beneficial for practitioners, particularly owner–managers of SMEs who can use this study as guidance on how to consider risk behavior to identify and select the critical sustainability risks and plan mitigating strategies accordingly. Originality/value: Scientific studies on using the PSI and its integration with prospect theory as means to assess the criticality of supply chain sustainability risks is very rare.

Management Decision,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how perceived attributes of the green market mediate the relationship between individuals' sustainability orientation and entrepreneurial intentions and to what extent field of study (business vs non-business) moderates this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The authors surveyed 314 students in French universities and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the moderated mediation mechanism. Findings: The results reveal that the adverse effects of the field of study on the relationship between sustainability orientation and entrepreneurial intentions through the mediating paths of green design and green supply chain. The authors found that these adverse effects were stronger for business students than for non-business students. Practical implications: The authors recommend that government and academia collaborate to make crucial management decisions that encourage a sustainable entrepreneurship culture, such as revising the academic curriculum and supporting the inclusion of public–private sector initiatives. Originality/value: This study contributes to and extends previous findings on the positive nexus between an individual's sustainability orientation and entrepreneurial intentions by theorizing the perceived attributes of the green market as a mediating process for translating sustainability beliefs into entrepreneurial intentions.

International Journal of Logistics Management,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how sustainable practices in supply chains are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of institutional theory. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a twofold data collection approach: 1) qualitative semistructured interviews and 2) secondary data collection that includes sustainability reports, newspaper articles, journal articles, strategic plans, research reports and statements made by authorities and stakeholders concerning decision-making. In total, managers representing six companies in Norway were interviewed. Findings: The study suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic, companies tend to focus on short-term decisions and economic issues. The long-term focus on sustainability has, however, increased at the cluster level. The research also indicates that the pandemic has led to the development of new business routines that may transform institutional norms. The diversity of institutional contexts can, on the one hand, drive sustainability transitions through pressures and supportive programs but, on the other hand, also hinder the development of sustainability thinking. Research limitations/implications: Institutional factors must be included when analyzing the effects of crises and sustainable transitions. Researchers are encouraged to explore the COVID-19 implications in the form of longitudinal studies. Practical implications: Policymakers can benefit from in-depth knowledge on the adverse effects of an institutional environment on sustainability. For managers, the outbreak of the pandemic can afford them additional time to revise their strategies and seek innovation. The pandemic highlights the need to build more resilient and sustainable systems that will aid managers in responding rapidly during future uncertainties and enduring sustainability trajectories in operations.

Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential synergy between companies’ sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) activities and their supply chain resilience (SCRES). The authors propose hypotheses about the impact of buying companies SSCM activities on the inflicted damage by unexpected supply chain disruptions and the recovery time afterwards and test these empirically using data from companies during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors investigate a sample of 231 of the largest publicly traded companies in the European Union with 4.158 firm-year observations. For the analysis, the authors generate variables capturing the companies’ intensity and years of experience of their SSCM activities targeted at the supply chain and run regression analyses on the inflicted damage due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recovery time after the disruption. Findings: Buying companies’ SSCM activities have a positive effect on their SCRES. The damage inflicted by unexpected supply chain disruptions is lower when companies have higher levels of SSCM and longer experience with it. The recovery time afterwards is significantly reduced by longer experience with SSCM efforts. Research limitations/implications: The authors suggest SCRES is reinforced by transparency, situational awareness, social capital and collaboration resulting from companies SSCM activities translate into increased SCRES. Practical implications: The authors show that companies with superior SSCM are more resilient in a crisis and conclude that, therefore, companies should invest in SSCM to prevent future supply disruptions. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirical study analyzing a data set of multi-industry companies, linking their SSCM activities to SCRES during the pandemic.","Eggert J., Hartmann J.",Sustainable supply chain management – a key to resilience in the global pandemic,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127771618&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-10-2021-0463&partnerID=40&md5=80b7fdac05d0464a37b0b7f61b734994

Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the academic literature on non-governmental organizations’ (NGOs) role in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) to develop a conceptual framework. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducts a systematic literature review through an analysis of 47 papers identified from peer-reviewed academic journals published from 2002 to 2020. Findings: Adopting social movement theory and based on thematic findings, this paper proposes four steps and six propositions in the process of NGOs fostering SSCM. These include relative deprivation, political opportunities, resource mobilization and collective action, based on which we developed a conceptual framework regarding the role of NGOs in improving sustainability in supply chains. The proposed conceptual model opens a new avenue of research in NGO literature and several directions for further research. Originality/value: This study may be the first to provide a systematic review of NGOs’ role in improving sustainability in supply chains.

Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is proposing a novel neutrosophical stakeholders' analysis approach for sustainable fashion supply chain (SFSC), presenting a supply chain members and objectives in order to conduct a sustainable business, investigating the roles and positions of these stakeholders, determining the contribution levels of these stakeholders to the sustainability objectives, and accordingly identifying the convergence and divergence among the stakeholders in terms of realization of the objectives. Design/methodology/approach: A novel neutrosophic set-based stakeholders' analysis Method of ACTors, Objectives, strength Reports (MACTOR) approach is proposed considering the uncertain and indeterminate opinions of decision-makers. In order to obtain the mutual opinions of decision-makers, Delphi technique is employed. Findings: The analysis results of this research emphasizes that although the manufacturers can be thought as the foremost actor is SFSC by producing the main product, they have no superior power on conducting the business. Besides, the government, customer and fashion firms are the key players shaping the fashion industry. Retailers and distribution centers can be interpreted as an intermediary in between the other stakeholders. Moreover, the eco-friendly packaging providers have not gained an important role that they were supposed to in terms of the sustainability objectives. Research limitations/implications: The application phase of the research includes the possibility of subjective judgments of the participants as a limitation. Therefore, Delphi technique is applied to overcome this challenge by multiple rounds of interviews for panel of participants in order to combine the benefits with elements of the wisdom of people.

Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to (1) identify the sustainable practices developed by the textile and apparel industry and (2) investigate the gaps and opportunities in the sustainability implementation process by quantitively analyzing the sustainability topics and the relevant topic trends. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed text mining techniques. A total of 1,168 relevant magazine articles published from 2013 to 2020 were collected and then categorized according to their tones. In total, 36 topics were identified by reviewing the sustainability issues in the industry. The frequency of each topic mentioned in the articles and the correlation coefficients between topics' frequencies and published time were calculated. The results were used to examine if the three sustainability dimensions (environment, society, economy) were equally addressed and identify opportunities in the sustainability implementation process. Findings: There were much fewer social and economic topics than environmental topics discussed in the articles. Additionally, there were not enough practices developed to reduce microfiber pollution, improve consumers' knowledge of sustainability, offset the carbon footprint, build a transparent, sustainable supply chain and avoid animal cruelty. Originality/value: There is a lack of research focusing on the whole supply chain and sustainability when investigating sustainable practices and topic trends. This study fills a part of the gap.

Foresight,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to address the global COVID-19 pandemic related to its sustainability, such as environmental, economic and social concerns. The short study also examined how various innovative approaches can help promote sustainable production. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology examines hypothetical scenarios of the current pandemic and tries to describe the quality of evidence to facilitate careful, critical engagement by readers. Secondary data is used to identify sustainability challenges, such as environmental, social and economic viability challenges. The information in this report was gathered from numerous media outlets, research agencies, policy papers, newspapers and other sources to gain a better knowledge of the issue. Findings: As a result, most industry executives and policymakers are looking for appropriate strategies and policies to improve their practices and meet consumer demand. The outcomes explore that the COVID-19 pandemic is a central factor in changes in people’s behavior, reflecting sustainability such as environmental, social and economic responsibility. The COVID-19 outbreak, surprisingly, had a bigger effect on sustainable consumption, accompanied by environmental sustainability, and, to a lesser extent, social and economic viability. Research limitations/implications: Limited secondary evidence and data could not scrutinize the study’s actual problem statements. Hence, it is recommended that the gap in research be fulfilled by conducting a primary survey among various groups of economists, environmentalists and industrialists using the cluster sampling technique by validating the questionnaire of the total sustainable production system. Proposing frameworks for improving the resilience of production and a systematic possible upgraded manufacturing system by using the Industry 4.0 technology during operational processes could advance market demand. Practical implications: The COVID-19 scenario has compelled manufacturing firms to put their production systems on hold for an extended period while they seek long-term solutions to assure simple delivery and cooperation from both business and consumer standpoints. Various aspects of supply and demand are discussed in the referendum, as well as production and consumption challenges during the COVID-19 era. There is a need to restore the production system and find the right source of raw materials. This work focuses on commodity inventory management systems due to mass production, but due to pandemics, it is not in demand and vice versa. The researcher made comprehensible remarks on the use of digitization in the pandemic, which improves social distancing and social well-being and promotes the production system as well. Besides, manufacturing plants should switch to digital manufacturing to reduce the number of workplaces and hence the risk of an outbreak. Therefore, a better supply chain network is needed to supply more manufacturing units. Social implications: There is a bright side of coronavirus that the public health crisis raised worldwide has brought many opportunities for governments and society to make eternal reforms in the public health sector door. During restricted movements for fulfilling market demand, the Industry 4.0 technologies for automation, mechanization and digitalization can help significantly advance a company. This technological advancement and computer digitization for the perspective people may improve the environment, economic and social sustainability also increase social media adoption, which can be crucial for agri-businesses to evaluate customers’ behavior and consumption trends. Originality/value: The paper also instructed to identify critical success factors, barriers and drivers for dealing with the pandemic situation and to develop a strategic policy framework to improve production and process flexibility through the remarkable introduction of digital manufacturing. Before it is too late to stop the spread, producers and consumers must grasp the limits to which suppliers might drive nature.","Begum H., Abbas K., Alam A.S.A.F., Song H., Chowdhury M.T., Abdul Ghani A.B.",Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment and socioeconomic viability: a sustainable production chain alternative,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123503058&doi=10.1108%2fFS-02-2021-0053&partnerID=40&md5=ce80f5373f5f2959de8b3cc025cd0dbc
Management Decision,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze how corporate social responsibility (CSR) affects a company's value. It does this specifically by analyzing the effect of socially responsible behaviors on shared value (SV) creation, in order to foster higher performance (PRF) and greater competitive advantages, considering the moderator role of the supply chain leadership dependency (SCLD). It provides new insights into CSR management to ensure business sustainability for supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a structured questionnaire to gather data from a cross-sectional sample of 425 supply chain partners for Portugal's biggest energy supplier. Structural equation modeling is used to test the proposed hypotheses, and a multigroup analysis is conducted to find how a supplier's dependency can impact the suggested relationships. Findings: The findings suggest that CSR positively impacts CA, SV and PRF. Additionally, this study reveals that SV has a positive impact on PRF. Additionally, the SCLD appears to moderate some of the proposed relationships. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides some empirical evidence of the influence of CSR on organizational value creation, contributing toward a better understanding of the impacts of socially responsible behaviors on business sustainability. The overall results may support the importance of CSR, identifying how a socially responsible company may create value for itself and share it with partners, thereby improving performance and competitiveness, while considering the role of dependency in moderating these relationships. Yet, the research considers only one company supplier. The relationships between variables need to be explored in other practical case studies and longitudinal investigations to improve upon the potential for making generalizations. Practical implications: Results show that being cooperative might make a company more competitive, which might be one of the foundations of CSR and sustainability. Social implications: This study claims that profit alone is no longer sufficient for the legitimization of business. As an alternative, SV creation has become the new goal for businesses seeking to regain and improve societal trust. Originality/value: The overall results may support the importance of CSR, identifying how a socially responsible company may create value for itself and share it with partners, thereby improving performance and competitiveness, while considering the role of dependency in moderating these relationships.","Fontoura P., Coelho A.",More cooperative.. more competitive?

Industrial Management and Data Systems,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the intention to adopt blockchain technology (BT) in operations and supply chain and to explore the moderating role of sustainability-oriented supplier development on the effects studied. Design/methodology/approach: The authors developed a conceptual framework based on the integration of technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory along with several strands of the literature in supply chain management and information systems. Drawing on survey data from 412 supply firms, a novel model using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was empirically tested in the context of the apparel industry of Bangladesh – the world's second-largest apparel supplier nation. Findings: The findings supported the theoretical framework developed. In particular, the findings suggested that supplier firms' intention to adopt blockchain in supply chains is influenced by relative advantage, compatibility, perceived trust, top management considerations, absorptive capacity, information sharing and collaborative culture, and trading partners' influence. However, regulatory support is yet to play a significant role in blockchain adoption behaviour. The findings also suggest that supplier development for sustainability significantly moderates the relationship between the several drivers' (e.g. relative advantage, compatibility, top management considerations and trading partners' influence) effects on blockchain adoption. Practical implications: The findings could help in developing an enabling environment for introducing blockchain-based apparel operations and supply chains. Originality/value: The study contributes to and expands the embryonic research stream of sustainable supply chain management and BT.

Kybernetes,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of greening and promotional effort dependent stochastic market demand on the remanufacturer's and the collector's profits when the quality of used products for remanufacturing is uncertain in a reverse supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model is developed to obtain optimal profits for the remanufacturer, the collector and the whole supply chain. Both the centralized and decentralized scenarios are considered. To motivate the collector through profit enhancement, the remanufacturer designs a cost-sharing contract. Through numerical examples and sensitivity analysis, the consequences of greenness and promotional effort on optimal profits are investigated. Findings: The results show that the remanufacturer gets benefited from greening and promotional effort enhancement. However, a higher value of minimum acceptable quality level decreases the profits of the manufacturer and the collector. A cost-sharing contract coordinates the supply chain and improves the remanufacturer's and the collector's profits. Besides green innovation, remanufacturing mitigates the harmful effects of waste in the environment. Originality/value: Two different viewpoints of remanufacturing are considered here – environmental sustainability and economic sustainability. This paper considers a reverse supply chain with a remanufacturer who remanufactures the used products collected by the collector.

Competitiveness Review,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to measure the supply chain competitiveness of the e-commerce industry in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a multi-criteria decision-making model based on the analytic hierarchy process. Four main criteria are used to measure the supply chain competitiveness, i.e. cost, differentiation, sustainability and infrastructure. Findings: The findings of this study show that cost is the most important criterion with a degree of importance of 33.19%, followed by infrastructure of 29.40%, differentiation of 27.96% and sustainability of 9.45%. It shows that the internally controlled strategy contributes about 70% of supply chain competitiveness. The internal infrastructure criterion that consists of software and hardware contributes 65.92% to the whole infrastructure criterion. The internal infrastructure then contributes 19.38% to supply chain competitiveness. Therefore, the internally controlled strategies and internal infrastructure contribute up to 90.08% to the supply chain competitiveness of e-commerce in Indonesia. This result implies that to attain the supply chain competitiveness, the company must carry out strategies focusing on the performance such as cost, differentiation, sustainability as well as on the internal infrastructure such as software and hardware. Research limitations/implications: In this paper, the authors limited their study to the business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) players because these two platforms have been experiencing a very rapid growth. While e-commerce business can take many platforms besides B2B and B2C, the future research should include other platform such as consumer to consumer as well. Because the focus in this study is more the information and material flows, it will be of great interest if the future research covers the platform of mobile payment as well that guarantee the ease of cashflows within supply chains. Also, with the occurrence of the Covid-19 pandemic when this paper was written, in the near future, it is then of great interest to incorporate the pandemic context into the proposed model used in this study. The further study should analyze long-term changes happened as the result of pandemic such as behavioral changes of online shopping from customer side or shift in e-commerce supply chain infrastructure and inventory practice. Practical implications: With this study, it is expected that it can be determined which criteria contribute the most to the supply chain competitiveness of the e-commerce industry in Indonesia that will be useful for industry player. Originality/value: E-commerce development in Indonesia is still facing serious challenges. The multi-criteria decision making approach used in this research lays a foundation of how supply chain competitiveness is determined based on the judgment of experts coming from major companies within the supply chain.","Febransyah A., Camelia Goni J.I.",Measuring the supply chain competitiveness of e-commerce industry in Indonesia,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096007473&doi=10.1108%2fCR-05-2020-0059&partnerID=40&md5=f385c4edacd963c76f9b3dc5e33ffe1d
Industrial Robot,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to present Industry 4.0 technologies for advancing the circular economy (CE) adaption in manufacturing industry’s supply chain (SC) network. To pursue the same, Industry 4.0 technological aspects were recognized as solution measures to overcome the challenges for CE implementation in SC. Design methodology approach: A new hierarchical framework containing 13 leading CE challenges and eight promising Industry 4.0 technological aspects had been proposed, representing their mutual relationship. The proposed framework was analysed using a hybrid approach of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS) under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) environment. The IVIF-AHP was used to acquire the priority weights of the CE challenges, whereas the IVIF-CODAS was used to attain the preference order of the proposed technological aspects. Findings: The key findings of the present work indicate that “Information disruptions among the SC members due to multiple channels” and “Manpower inability to handle the toxic materials” are the two most critical challenges hindering the adoption of CE practices in SC. Along with, the results also demonstrate that to overcome these challenges, “Smarter equipment to empower flexibility and mass customization” and “Big data driven decision-making system” are the two most significant Industry 4.0 technological solutions, adoption of which might encourage the organizations to align their operations with CE philosophies. Research limitations implications: The sample size of the experts engaged in work was limited; however, big data studies could be conducted in future to capture more insights of the stated topic. In addition to this, to understand the implication of CE on Industry 4.0-based manufacturing, a separate study can be synthesised in future. Originality value: The proposed work facilitates a new framework consolidating various perspectives associated with CE implementation into a manufacturing industry considering the scenario of Indian rubber industry. This study enables the decision-makers to recognize the challenging factors for CE implementation into their organizations and up-taking the proposed Industry 4.0 practices as technological measures for improving the organization overall performance.","Agarwal S., Tyagi M., Garg R.K.",Framework development and evaluation of Industry 4.0 technological aspects towards improving the circular economy-based supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125774313&doi=10.1108%2fIR-10-2021-0246&partnerID=40&md5=d77e1152b985397e9c7b06a3ea6d98d7
Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide new insight into the modern slavery threat and to enhance its detection in supply chains by understanding and addressing barriers to whistleblowing. A broad definition of a whistle-blower is adopted, which includes any witness internal or external to an organisation. Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint paper that includes using news reports and other secondary data sources on a recent modern slavery scandal in garment factories in Leicester, UK and the lens of the bystander effect from the social psychology literature. The core focus is on whistleblowing by members of the local community in which an operation or supply chain is embedded. Findings: The phenomenon of modern slavery being an “open secret” within the local community is highlighted. But rather than the case being characterised by widespread whistleblowing, the problem only came into full focus when poor working conditions and forced labour during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions contributed to the spread of the virus. It is argued that overcoming this “bystander effect” can lead to the greater mobilisation of modern slavery whistleblowing. Research limitations/implications: Two sets of propositions and a conceptual model are provided and seven future research suggestions are outlined, including extending the present study to whistleblowing by victims and other internal members of an organisation or supply chain. Practical implications: If it can be mobilised, then whistleblowing has the potential to be an important part of detecting modern slavery, either temporarily replacing audits where they are not possible due to social distancing restrictions or directing the use of limited auditing resources to high-risk factories. In this way, combinations of practices can be effectively used to tackle the threat. Social implications: This contributes to addressing an important societal problem and one of the grandest challenges facing modern-day supply chains. This, it has been argued, is an even bigger problem now than ever before given the economic and market conditions created by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Originality/value: This is the first paper to focus on operationalising the practice of whistleblowing as a source of greater supply chain intelligence to aid modern slavery detection. Causes of the bystander effect include the perceived low-emergency threat of modern slavery, the high-ambiguity environment, a low bystander responsibility and low assistance/intervention incentive. Countermeasures include elevating the emergency status of modern slavery, creating a shared sense of responsibility for tackling the problem, having clear reporting channels and taking swift and consistent action when instances of modern slavery are detected.",Stevenson M.,Hidden in plain sight: the bystander effect and the mobilisation of modern slavery whistleblowing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106299991&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-08-2020-0373&partnerID=40&md5=e233f0f35d01453c15e992d60964d7e1
Journal of Enterprise Information Management,"Purpose: The purpose of this study to introduce a new extended framework to evaluate and rank the sustainable suppliers based on the different sustainable criteria in the manufacturing companies using a new fuzzy decision-making approach. Design/methodology/approach: This paper introduces a new approach using decision-making and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) to assess the best sustainable supplier. To doing so, this study integrated the entropy, stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and weighted aggregates sum product assessment (WASPAS) methods under PFSs. To calculate the criteria weights, the combined entropy-SWARA method is used to compute the objective weight and subjective weight, respectively. Furthermore, the WASPAS model is utilized to rank sustainable supplier alternatives. Findings: The results of the analysis found that occupational health and safety systems had the highest rank among other criteria, followed by green product and eco-design, green R&D and innovation and green technology. In addition, the findings of the paper demonstrated that the extended approach was efficient and useful for selecting and evaluating the best sustainable supplier in the manufacturing companies. Originality/value: Recent years have witnessed a number of studies aimed at incorporating the sustainability standards into the supplier selection problem; however, only a little research has been conducted on developing a fuzzy method for decision-making in a manner to assess and choose suppliers with high sustainability in the insurance market, encompassing the three above-mentioned sustainability criteria.","Alrasheedi M., Mardani A., Mishra A.R., Rani P., Loganathan N.",An extended framework to evaluate sustainable suppliers in manufacturing companies using a new Pythagorean fuzzy entropy-SWARA-WASPAS decision-making approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106340350&doi=10.1108%2fJEIM-07-2020-0263&partnerID=40&md5=ce28267b40cd079bd24c511c462ae2b3
TQM Journal,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to comprehend the current state of green supply chain management (GSCM) and its drivers and enablers in the pharmaceutical supply chains (PSCs). Design/methodology/approach: This study developed a model consisting of the factors green drivers, green enablers and green practices. For this study, data were collected from 166 supply chain heads from 124 pharmaceutical companies operating in India. The data was empirically analysed using SmartPLS3 software. Findings: The study revealed that in Indian PSCs, public pressure, supplier pressure and competitor pressure were the major drivers for GSCM practices and coercive pressures such as pressure from government and regulatory bodies were insignificant drivers. The results indicated that the influence of green drivers and green enablers altered with supply chain flow. Green drivers indicated higher influence at the upstream of PSCs whereas the influence of green enablers was higher at the downstream of PSCs. Furthermore, the study revealed that the factor “green enablers” was a good mediator for the relationship between “green drivers” and “GSCM practices” in PSCs. Research limitations/implications: This study was an extension work with the addition of external green drivers to the self-induced organizational activities. Further investigations can be done by including the “green barriers” construct in the conceptual model. Practical implications: This research connected the institutional theory with the resource-based view to understanding the role of green drivers and green enablers in greening PSC. For managers and regulators, this study provided clear insights on how to approach different supply chain drivers and enablers to maximize the impact of GSCM practices. Moreover, the findings of this study helped in incorporating knowledge about GSCM into a framework that can be used for defining strategies for setting up a sustainable PSC for pharmaceutical products leading to the development and growth of the pharmaceuticals industry. Originality/value: Most of the earlier studies on GSCM were at the firm level and some studies were at the supply chain level. To further enhance the scope of GSCM theory, this study was conducted at two different levels, first at the complete supply chain level and second at three different levels: upstream, firm-level and downstream.","Sabat K.C., Krishnamoorthy B., Bhattacharyya S.S.",Green drivers and green enablers in pharmaceuticals supply chain: in the context of an emerging economy,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130931238&doi=10.1108%2fTQM-11-2021-0333&partnerID=40&md5=8a20be859f72d0b0958fc73dc96cad72
Social Responsibility Journal,"Purpose: The qualitative (focus group) portion of this study aims to examine the perceptions and opinions of corporate and nongovernmental organization (NGO) executives in Vietnam about corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, issues and priorities in Vietnam, the role of various external stakeholders in supporting CSR practices and how corporates and NGOs can work together to support each other’s CSR agendas. The quantitative (survey) portion of this study aims to examine how Vietnamese companies across different sectors prioritize CSR issues and goals, budget for CSR, report on CSR and centrally (or decentrally) manage CSR programs. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative and quantitative research study of executives in NGO, multinational and domestic-only firms operating in Vietnam. Qualitative (focus group) data were collected from 20 participants in three focus groups. Quantitative data were collected through an online survey of respondents from 186 companies throughout Vietnam. Findings: The focus group findings support the research literature that CSR agenda and priorities amongst Vietnamese domestic companies are strongly influenced by long-standing norms, values and religious beliefs embedded in the Vietnamese culture that support their role in charitable giving and improving the welfare and well-being of Vietnamese citizens. The findings also indicate that CSR and sustainability programs are more fully funded and developed by multinational subsidiaries in Vietnam who have more capital and human resources to support their initiatives. The survey findings indicate that enhanced reputation, attracting new customers, securing more sustainable supply chains, developing innovative or new products/services and improving risk management are the top five business goals amongst the 186 companies surveyed.

International Journal of Emerging Markets,"Purpose: The recent pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly impacted the operational performances of pharmaceutical supply chains (SCs), especially in emerging economies that are critically vulnerable due to their inadequate resources. Finding the possible barriers that continue to impede the sustainable performance of SCs in the post-COVID-19 era has become essential. This study aims to investigate and analyze the barriers to achieving sustainability in the pharmaceutical SC of an emerging economy in a bid to help decision-makers recognize the most influential barriers. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the goals, two decision-making tools are integrated to analyze the most critical barriers: interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and the matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to classification (MICMAC). In contrast to other multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches, ISM develops a hierarchical decision tool for decision-makers and cluster analysis of the barriers using the MICMAC method based on their driving and dependency powers. Findings: The findings reveal that the major barriers are in a four-level hierarchical relationship where “Insufficient SC strategic plans to ensure agility during crisis” acts as the most critical barrier, followed by “Poor information structure among SC contributors,” and “Inadequate risk management policy under pandemic.” Finally, the MICMAC analysis validates the findings from the ISM approach. Originality/value: This study provides meaningful insights into barriers to achieving sustainability in pharmaceutical SCs in the post-COVID-19 era. The study can help pharmaceutical SC practitioners to better understand what can go wrong in post-COVID-19, and develop actionable strategies to ensure sustainability and resilience in practitioners' SCs.","Liza S.A., Chowdhury N.R., Paul S.K., Morshed M., Morshed S.M., Bhuiyan M.A.T., Rahim M.A.",Barriers to achieving sustainability in pharmaceutical supply chains in the post-COVID-19 era,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129318903&doi=10.1108%2fIJOEM-11-2021-1680&partnerID=40&md5=2aa1c2f34ba1263a21816c6a771c44d0
Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management,"Purpose: The relationship between sustainability, traceability and transparency in the fashion-apparel industry, characterised by complex, labour-intensive and geographically dispersed supply chains (SCs), needs further clarification. The first goal of this study is to revise, refine and adapt to the scope of this industry, the conceptualisation of traceability and transparency and their interrelations with sustainability. The second goal is to uncover the key elements responsible for fostering and hindering their relationship in the fashion-apparel practice.

Sustainable Operations and Computers,"Purpose: The rising interest in the integration of digital advanced manufacturing and production systems in the Industry 4.0 context is one of the main factors in the introduction of Additive Manufacturing (AM). The novel technology might change the way firms operate, and the way they interact with consumers, opening new horizons for an improved profit margin and more sustainable business models. The research presented a comprehensive review on the potent role of AM in adhering to customers’ complicated and unique needs using various technologies and techniques, as it discussed the role of AM in introducing new business models that increase the business competitiveness and profitability through an optimisation of production processes. In addition, AM is grasping with innovative solutions varying from waste reduction to shorter supply chains to longer products lifecycle, incentivising firms to adopt it for the economies realised on materials, energy, and costs. Notwithstanding, AM implementation is still in its infancy and faces technical challenges of capability, IT integration, and outcomes. Design/Methodology/approach: This research is based on a quantitative approach that was administered online by means of a highly structured online survey, which aim was to collect primary data that fills the gaps of the research hypotheses due to the lacking nature of research papers exploring them. Therefore, the literature review was a paramount phase in acquiring empirical knowledge about the problem background and concept boundaries that shaped the topic's core objectives and research questions from the lacking nature of explored areas. Findings: This research investigated the role of AM in industry 4.0 by exploring its impact and intersection with AM firms’ business models while exposing the limitations and challenges to its adoption within industrial contexts. The study highlighted that the AM positive impacts on companies’ business models on the value chain and turnover. This study also revealed the eco-design prospect of AM that will be helpful for different firms to rethink their business models shaping them to be more cost-efficient. Originality: This research gave insight on AM technology through a quantitative survey that mainly aimed to classify knowledge and to investigate the role of AM as a lever in improving firms’ value chains through an exploration of possible intersections with business models and impacts of implementation, possible sustainability scenarios and challenges it may face within Industry 4.0 context.","Elhazmiri B., Naveed N., Anwar M.N., Haq M.I.U.",The role of additive manufacturing in industry 4.0: An exploration of different business models,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137955732&doi=10.1016%2fj.susoc.2022.07.001&partnerID=40&md5=7b242a2373aee8cab53862fa266a1926
International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management,"Purpose: The study aims to identify the potential drivers of big data analytics (BDA) practices in the supply chain and develop a sustainability evaluation model to evaluate drivers of big data for sustainability development. Design/methodology/approach: The mixed-method approach was applied to assess sustainability dimensions and calculate the score using two phases. In Phase I, the BDA drivers in the e-commerce industry were finalised using the partial least square based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method. In Phase II, a case study in the Indian fashion e-commerce industry was carried out to evaluate sustainability dimensions with respect to drivers of BDA and the sustainability score was calculated using the fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (AHP) method. Findings: The index for economic sustainability (0.220), social sustainability (0.142) and environmental sustainability (0.182) were derived. The higher index value of economic sustainability compared to social sustainability and environmental sustainability signified those drivers of big data bring social and environmental uncertainty along with economic sustainability.

International Journal of Wine Business Research,"Purpose: The wine industry is the one that is tightly linked to sustainability as its processes both impact and are impacted by the environment, society and companies’ financial well-being. However, data show that this may not be recognized in practice. Thus, this research paper aims to examine what has changed with respect to sustainability practices over the past 10–15 years in this industry. Design/methodology/approach: A development-based multi-method approach was used to examine the purpose. In Phase 1, a grounded theory study conducted between 2009 and 2015 from wine businesses in 12 different global regions brought to light a potential disconnect between theory and practice in the importance of sustainability. In Phase 2, a comprehensive literature review and analysis of updated online content from the Phase 1 companies was conducted to paint a picture of the progression of sustainability focus and its implementation in company processes. Findings: Using legitimacy theory as a foundation, it was found that the choice to pursue sustainability in this industry generally begins with a focus on environmental practices followed by financial sustainability and more recently social sustainability.

International Journal of Logistics Management,"Purpose: There is now much emphasis in both research and practice on the principles of circular economies. In this paper remanufacturing is examined as a key enabler of circular practices, and the concept of “Product-Agnostic Manufacturing” (PAR) is proposed. This work differentiates PAR from many traditional approaches to remanufacturing by virtue of PAR's treatment of product variety. Most existing approaches to remanufacturing feature low variety and standardisation; this study instead suggests that the exploitation of flexibilities in both operations and supply chains leads to new competitive strategies for firms to exploit. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual study that builds on a thorough exploration of contemporary remanufacturing literature in the development of the new PAR concept. Findings: Through a detailed literature review it is shown that there are a range of benefits, challenges, and critical success factors that underpin the remanufacturing concept. Building on this understanding and bridging literature in operations flexibility and supply chain design, a detailed discussion on the nature of PAR is provided, and an agenda for future research developed. Originality/value: Whilst there has been much literature on remanufacturing, there is a general tendency to treat supply chain and remanufacturing operations quite distinctly in individual articles. Additionally, there has been little consideration of multi-product remanufacturing, and for the limited studies where this is done, the emphasis is typically on problem avoidance. This study aims to provide a detailed insight into the developed PAR concept, showing how the remanufacture of a wide range of product varieties may be achieved through flexible operations and supply chain design.","Hofmeester R., Eyers D.R.",Strategic opportunities for product-agnostic remanufacturing,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132906736&doi=10.1108%2fIJLM-11-2021-0556&partnerID=40&md5=a58aca8e36d004b1785c14b1816a16e9
International Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Purpose: There is still significant variation in firms' efforts to address modern slavery issues in supply chains despite the importance of this grand challenge. This research adopts the awareness-motivation-capability (AMC) framework to investigate AMC-related factors that help to explain this variation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors hypothesize how AMC-related factors, including media coverage of modern slavery issues, slavery risks in supply chains and corporate sustainability performance, are related to firms' efforts to address modern slavery in supply chains. The proposed hypotheses are tested based on 201 UK firms' modern slavery statements and additional secondary data collected from Factiva, Factset Revere, The Global Slavery Index, Worldscope and Sustainalytics. Findings: Consistent with the AMC perspective, the test results show that firms put more effort into addressing supply chain modern slavery issues when there is greater media coverage of these issues, when firms source from countries with higher slavery risks, and when firms have better corporate sustainability performance. Additional analysis further suggests that firms' financial performance is not related to their efforts to address modern slavery issues. Originality/value: This is the first study adopting the AMC framework to investigate firms' efforts to address modern slavery in supply chains. This investigation provides important implications for researchers studying firm behaviors related to modern slavery issues and for policymakers designing policies that enable firms to address these issues, in view of their awareness, motivation and capability.","Geng R., Lam H.K.S., Stevenson M.",Addressing modern slavery in supply chains: an awareness-motivation-capability perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124897457&doi=10.1108%2fIJOPM-07-2021-0425&partnerID=40&md5=06b06754bfae6073e5c7b600778c6ef6
International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management,"Purpose: This article encourages novel approaches in the SSCM literature to create transformative change for workers in developing countries' apparel supply chains. It examines how suppliers' implementation of social sustainability is moderated by buyers' pressures (through dyadic ties) and by similar suppliers' pressures (through extended ties). Design/methodology/approach: The article adopts a qualitative method design based on fieldwork and 21 face-to-face interviews with suppliers' senior managers. The data were collected between 2017 and 2020 in the factory premises of suppliers in Pakistan. Findings: This article distinguishes the pressures that moderate suppliers' implementation of social sustainability positively (top-down encouragement, informal exchange and competitive convergence) and negatively (unrewarded commitment) through social ties. Hence, it shows how suppliers experience constrained proactivity as a state of tension. Originality/value: The article primarily contributes to the SSCM literature by informing how similar suppliers' pressures in the business community constitute important processes of social governance and are key to create transformative change upstream in apparel supply chains. Against this backdrop, it cautions about buyers' opposite pressures and misuse of their negotiation power, which indirectly holds back and dilutes transformative change.","Fontana E., Atif M., Heuer M.",Implementing social sustainability through market pressures: an inter-organizational network analysis in the Pakistani apparel supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124355880&doi=10.1108%2fIJPDLM-07-2021-0265&partnerID=40&md5=33a484f7c98e9f18d34aadba92e29132
Greening of Industry Networks Studies,"Purpose: This chapter examines how the West African subregion can generate and sustain the desired value of its global supply chains from accumulated knowledge resources gained from past international trade relations with the rest of the world.Methodology: The Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the European Union (EU) and Africa Caribbean Pacific regions is explored as a case study. As part of its external policies, the EU is participating in various trade agreements such as the EPA, striving towards mutual economic development. We analyse comprehensive data from the Eurostat of the European Commission and the data centre of the United Nation Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTADSTAT).Key findings: Our analysis of data reveals severe uneven trade outcomes between West Africa and the EU. Drawing on organizational learning theory, we explain how participating West African countries have hardly learned from experiences of prior trade agreements and particularly the current EPA. This has hindered export trade and industrialization and impeded sustainable growth of participating African countries in the global value chain over the years.Implications: The study discusses critical policy implications for the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), which will hone Africa’s sustainable growth in the global value chain and future trade relations with the rest of the world.","Adjei-Bamfo P., Lartey E., Odoi B., Adjei-Bamfo S., Baiden E.",The Impact of the EPA on West Africa: The Mediating Role of an Intra-African Trade Policy for Africa’s Sustainable Growth in the Global Value Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124521083&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-78791-2_12&partnerID=40&md5=339606f06b40b86a5c02def5a3c6fa63

Data were collected using in-depth face-to-face interviews.Key findings: First, Zambian contractors and suppliers implement multi-national buyer firm’s sustainability requirements in environmental, economic or social perspectives. They hardly implement them in terms of the triple bottom perspective, including all these perspectives. Second, local contractors and suppliers mostly implement the social aspect of sustainability in their businesses. They do this mainly to comply with the buyer’s requirements rather than by their own choice. Third, multi-national buyer firm’s sustainability requirements include local firms that offer specialised goods and services as well as those they have long-term relationships with. Lastly, a number of local contractors and suppliers are excluded due to the many requirements imposed by multi-national buyer firms.Practical implications: The findings inform stakeholders such as suppliers, contractors, buyers and the government on understanding the environmental, economic and social sustainability in the global supply chain as this would encourage suppliers and contractors to be more responsible.Originality/value: This chapter contributes to the literature on how contractors and suppliers interpret the sustainability requirements of multi-national buyer firms and explores how these requirements include or exclude local contractors and suppliers in Zambia, a hardly researched Africa country.","Nakamba C.C., Choongo P., Simasiku P.L.",Multi-national Buyer Firms’ Sustainability Requirements in a Developing Economy: An Explorative Study of Zambian Contractors and Suppliers,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124568242&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-78791-2_7&partnerID=40&md5=d0ccdd920d8f0e33355d44c1e5930c14

Innovation and Management Review,"Purpose: This exploratory research aims to analyze sustainable innovation in the context of inclusive business in Latin America. Design/methodology/approach: The study performs a summative content analysis of 22 inclusive businesses (IBs) of current Business Call to Action (BCtA) members in Latin America. Codes were created to identify the modification or introduction of sustainable products/services/processes. Data were analyzed using NVivo 12. Findings: Results show a prevalence of Colombian examples within Latin American inclusive business, and a more significant proportion in the agricultural sector, consistent with reports found in the literature. The authors found that sustainable innovation takes place when introducing new products/services/processes that respond to the needs of the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) population, or modifying existing processes and services to make them more sustainable. Originality/value: As most sustainable innovation literature is product-oriented and technically dominated, these results contribute to the newer works adopting a more comprehensive conception of innovation, providing empirical evidence at the product, service and process levels. The results provide insights on how inclusive businesses make adaptations to improve the sustainability of their supply chains to bring their products/services within reach of isolated and disadvantaged communities. The findings also suggest that sustainable product innovation in an inclusive business goes beyond a cost reduction objective.

"Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal","Purpose: This paper aims to address the conceptual and practical challenges in integrating triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability in the agriculture supply chain (ASC). It identifies the key enablers for each of the three dimensions of TBL sustainability, analyses their causal relationships as well as cross-dimensional interactions under each TBL dimension. Further, it develops a decision support framework (DSF) for the assessment of TBL sustainability practices and policies in ASC and validates it through a case study. Design/methodology/approach: An interpretive structure modelling (ISM) methodology is deployed to establish the interrelationships among all TBL enablers and to identify the enablers with high driving power on sustainable ASC. Brainstorming by a group of experts was used to identify the relevant enables. Finally, a DSF was developed as a resultant of ISM. Findings: The paper provides a set of enablers with high driving power that can significantly influence the sustainability practices and policies in ASC. The social enablers directly help to enhance the effect of economic enablers and collectively these enhance the effect of environmental enablers. If agriculture firms and supply chains design innovative policies and develop practices based on these enablers, they can achieve sustainable ASC. Consequently, the living standards of the people directly or indirectly associated with the agriculture firm or supply chain can be improved without compromising on economic performance. Research limitations/implications: The paper consolidates the fragmented knowledge of sustainable supply chain management in the agriculture sector and suggests a DSF to policymakers, managers and practitioners for assessing TBL sustainability practices and policies. The DSF has wide applicability in other sectors of production and operations management as these sectors also face the challenge of achieving TBL sustainability across their supply chain. Practical implications: The DSF, developed in the paper, is a useful tool for practitioners to frame and analyse sustainability initiatives and policies for ASC. A firm or supply chain may achieve TBL sustainability if it succeeds in uplifting the social status of its stakeholders. Social implications: It is a first step towards addressing the practical challenge of integrating sustainability in the agriculture sector of emerging economies and provides a path to improve the livelihood of people in the agriculture sector. Stakeholder engagement with a focus on collaboration and awareness may lead to the desired social and environmental consequences. Potential adverse social effects also need to be considered. Originality/value: This paper focusses on the so far rather neglected but essential aspect of integrating TBL sustainability in the agriculture sector of emerging economies. The hierarchal representation and classification of the TBL sustainability enablers of sustainability is a unique effort in the field of ASC. Development of DSF is one of the first attempts to create a mapping between various enablers of TBL sustainability. The novelty of the study lies in the sector-specific, holistic evaluation of TBL sustainability policy measures that may lead to improvements in practice.","Singh S., Srivastava S.K.",Decision support framework for integrating triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability in agriculture supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118970167&doi=10.1108%2fSAMPJ-07-2021-0264&partnerID=40&md5=95d22030e79e6d0948e698eb6a4f890e
International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,"Purpose: This paper aims to address the supplier selection problem based on a developed framework capturing the essence of the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model, sustainability and providing services to customers. Specifically, the authors consider planning, manufacturing, delivery, sustainability and customer service attributes to evaluate and select suppliers. Design/methodology/approach: Relevant literature is reviewed, a framework capturing the essence of major supply chain functions was developed and suitable measurement attributes were identified. An integrated fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution method are employed to obtain the final ranking of the attributes and suppliers. The proposed methodology is illustrated through a real case of an Indian automobile company. Findings: The authors observed that planning, manufacturing, customer service, sustainability and delivery are preferred in decreasing order to select component suppliers for an automotive company. The impact of suppliers on planning and manufacturing is most important to consider while assessing suppliers. Interestingly, concerns about sustainability and delivery are the least cared factors when selecting suppliers. The top five criteria contain measures of operational efficiency rather than purchasing cost. Originality/value: This paper proposes and demonstrates a supplier selection framework harmonizing supply chain functions of the SCOR model, sustainability and customers service that adds a valuable wing to literature that expounds on the connection of purchasing strategy to corporate strategy.

International Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Purpose: This paper aims to adopt the strategy-structure-performance (SSP) framework to explore how proactive social strategy could motivate firms to collaborate with suppliers on social sustainability initiatives, and how such collaborative efforts could unlock a win-win opportunity for both noneconomic (social performance) and economic (operational performance) performance. Additionally, drawing on the tenets of the social exchange theory, the different moderating effects of distributive justice and procedural justice on the social collaboration-performance relationship are also examined. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses survey data collected from 215 manufacturing companies in China. The proposed hypotheses are tested using multiple linear regression models as well as the PROCESS macro within SPSS. Findings: The results suggest that (1) a proactive social strategy could motivate firms to collaborate with suppliers on joint social activities and (2) social collaboration with suppliers can have a significant positive effect on both social and operational performance. The moderation results suggest that distributive justice has a differential effect on the collaboration-performance link. Particularly, distributive justice strengthens the relationship between social collaboration and operational performance, while it weakens the relationship between social collaboration and social performance. Surprisingly, procedural justice did not have a significant moderating effect on the social collaboration-performance link. Originality/value: This paper extends the SSP framework to the social sustainability context by not only stressing the importance of proactivity in managing sustainability, but also revealing collaboration as a structural aspect that could achieve superior performance benefits. This study also contributes to sustainable supply chain literature by exploring the moderating roles of justice elements.","Lim J.J., Dai J., Paulraj A.",Collaboration as a structural aspect of proactive social sustainability: the differential moderating role of distributive and procedural justice,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138846352&doi=10.1108%2fIJOPM-06-2021-0402&partnerID=40&md5=a39c8ec1beac9e281e0871f6652c44cf
"Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal","Purpose: This paper aims to demonstrate methods that sustainability-conscious brands can use to include their primary producers in the measurement and reporting of the environment and sustainability performance of their supply chains. It explores three questions: How can farm businesses provide information required in sustainability reporting? What are the challenges and opportunities experienced in preparing and presenting the information? What future research and policy instruments might be needed to resolve these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This study identifies and describes methods to provide the farm-level information needed for environmental performance and sustainability reporting frameworks. It demonstrates them by compiling natural capital accounts and environmental performance information for two wool producers in the grassy woodland biome of Eastern Australia; the contrasting history and management of these producers would be expected to result in different environmental performances. Findings: The authors demonstrated an approach to NC accounting that is suitable for including primary producers in environmental performance reporting of supply chains and that can communicate whether individual producers are sustaining, improving or degrading their NC. Measurements suitable for informing farm management and for the estimation of supply chain performance can simultaneously produce information useful for aggregation to regional and national assessments. Practical implications: The methods used should assist sustainability-conscious supply chains to more accurately assess the environmental performance of their primary producers and to use these assessments in selective sourcing strategies to improve supply chain performance. Empirical measures of environmental performance and natural capital have the potential to enable evaluation of the effectiveness of sustainability accounting frameworks in inducing businesses to reduce their environmental impacts and improve the condition of the natural capital they depend on. Social implications: Two significant social implications exist for the inclusion of primary producers in the sustainability and environmental performance reporting of supply chains. Firstly, it presently takes considerable time and expense for producers to prepare this information. Governments and members of the supply chain should acknowledge the value of this information to their organisations and consider sharing some of the cost of its preparation with primary producers. Secondly, the “additionality” requirement commonly present in existing frameworks may perversely exclude already high-performing producers from being recognised. The methods proposed in this paper provide a way to resolve this. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first to describe detailed methods of collecting data for natural capital accounting and environmental performance reporting for individual farms and the first to compile the information and present it in a manner coherent with the Kering EP&L and the UN SEEA EA. The authors believe that this will make a significant contribution to the development of fair and standardised ways of measuring individual farm performance and the performance of food, beverage and apparel supply chains.","Ogilvy S., O'Brien D., Lawrence R., Gardner M.",A natural capital accounting framework to communicate the environmental credentials of individual wool-producing businesses,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130300557&doi=10.1108%2fSAMPJ-06-2021-0191&partnerID=40&md5=d5378ff3629a7b74ff5d4d76442b6816
Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: This paper aims to develop frameworks to support implementation and competitive leveraging of distinct sustainable supply chain operations. This derives from conceptual definition of the dynamic capabilities required to support Hart’s (1995) natural-resource-based view resources in the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual study uses qualitative content analysis to extract capabilities from review and analysis of literature related to natural-resource-based view (NRBV) and sustainable supply chain management. Intercoder reliability assessments support conceptual development of such capabilities into dynamic capability frameworks. Findings: Specific interrelations between each NRBV resource and corresponding supply chain strategies are conceptualised. From this, capabilities are categorised to corresponding resources, dynamic capabilities activities and internal–external focus. This results in definition of 107 dynamic NRBV capabilities. Research limitations/implications: Contributions are threefold: distinct frameworks for competitive sustainable supply chain management is offered; the NRBV benefits from enhanced practical guidance via the definition of its dynamic capabilities, addressing the theory-practice gap; and understandings of dynamic capabilities and their role in both the NRBV sustainable supply chain management is advanced. Practical implications: This paper offers four frameworks to allow firms to tailor sustainability strategies to suit their needs and guide competitive leveraging. Definition of capabilities offers practical guidance to operationalise NRBV resources.

International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,"Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate the collaboration quality performance of sugar company Z and its stakeholders (farmers and distributors) by considering the sustainability aspects. This assessment shall be able to integrate qualitative and quantitative factors in the model, which is critical in sugar supply chains involving multi-stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: Integration of quality function deployment (QFD), the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) is administered to assess the efficiency score of each stakeholder involved. The evaluation encompasses collaboration behaviour factors since the input of collaboration activities will result in sustainability aspects such as revenue, green house gas (GHG) emissions and social impact. The analysis has been conducted in two scenarios, those are the basic scenario by utilising original data and the extended scenario by using projection data. Findings: The result clarifies that the most influential behaviour factor in the collaboration activities is commitment (0.116), while the least important behaviour factors are power (0.008) and adaptation (0.008). Furthermore, by using the extended scenario, the overall efficiency for each benchmarking is higher compared to the condition before the improvement (basic scenario). Research limitations/implications: The result of this study is only relevant to the particular sugar supply chain and involving limited sustainability variables. Therefore, in a further study, more variables such as technical and financial aspects could be explored further in the assessment process. Practical implications: The result of this study is available for each stakeholder and can be fundamental for the constant improvement in sustainable supply chain (SSC) practices. It shows that an improvement of one stakeholder will positively impact the entire system.

Management Decision,"Purpose: This paper aims to examine the mechanism of how circular economy practices (CEP) and circular economy entrepreneurship (CEE) promote sustainable supply chain management (SCM) and facilitate sustainable performance (SP) for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the food value chain in emerging economy. In this context, this mechanism involves the mediating role of sustainable SCM in the relationship between CEP and SP. Simultaneously, it involves the moderating role of CEE in the link between CEP and sustainable SCM. Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows a quantitative approach. Based on systematic literature review on the field, the nexus amongst the constructs were proposed. The Smart partial least square (PLS) version 3.3.2 was employed to analyze structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate the relationships between constructs and latent variables. There were 457 valid responses obtained from the survey participants, those are managers at senior and middle levels. The data collected was then used for quantitative analysis and assessment. Findings: The main finding of this study is twofold. First, it sheds light on how CEE associates in strengthening the influence of CEP on sustainable SCM. By this way, the better the CEE, the stronger the impact of the CEP on the sustainable SCM, leading to long-term sustainability. Second, it reveals how sustainable SCM mediates the link between CEP and SP. By this way, the better the CEP, the more the SCM is sustainable, ultimately leading to SP. This contribution is paramount because experimental research on this mechanism has not been intensively explored in the current literature. Originality/value: The originality of this study is the provision of scientific knowledge and practical mechanisms for the introduction and application of CEP to business behaviors and practices in a real-world context that exists as a research gap in the current literature. In this respect, this study contributes to expanding the existing literature in the field by providing empirical evidence for the mechanism as stated. Furthermore, it provides a practical mechanism for SMEs in given context to enable them apply efficiently the circular economy perspective to their businesses to help them achieve SP.

Journal of Knowledge Management,"Purpose: This paper aims to examine the performance of marginalized farmers in supply relationships with agri-tech firms in emerging rural agricultural economies. The complex relationship among the suppliers, dual relationship and knowledge transfer (KT) was studied. This paper empirically investigates the relationship between KT and supplier’s performance improvement (SPI) via buyer–supplier relationship (BSR). Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on agency theory, a conceptual framework has been proposed to identify the mediation effect of BSR. The context deals with suppliers who are farmers in developing nations. The hypotheses were tested using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation with a sample of 121 marginalized farmers from Indian states. The data was collected using a survey instrument designed by adapting the well-cited and validated measures. These marginalized farmers worked in collaboration with the agri-tech firms facilitating them with the KT. Findings: The relationships established from the results also indicate the fact that KT is a powerful tool to make connections with farmers that lead to their performance improvement. The KT was found as a driver to improve performance (SPI) and the BSR acted as a positive mediator in this study. The complex relationships among the KT, BSR and SPI hold. Research limitations/implications: This paper can be subscribed to various nuanced understandings of the agricultural supply chain context in emerging economies, in the specialized cases where farmers belong to the marginalized communities. This study has the scope to replicate using a mixed-method approach in emerging economies beyond India. It also advances the agency theory literature in the supply chain discipline of emerging rural economies. Practical implications: This study offers strategic implications for agri-tech practitioners, policymakers and academic debate. The marginalized farmers with KT and improved BSR can become a part of the mainstream value chain, their debts can be reduced, suicides can be prevented and the quality of their family life can be significantly improved. Originality/value: This study makes a unique contribution by investigating how the agri-tech firms (non-traditional buyer) and supplier relationship and KT helps improve the economic sustainability of smallholder farmers in India. The authors immersed themselves in fieldwork by interacting and meeting in person with 121 farmers residing in the remotest of the remote rural areas across multiple states of India.

Design/methodology/approach: Applying case study methodology and drawing on Suchman’s theory on societal legitimacy, it is argued that social audits are artefacts of legitimacy, and global firms dominate the buyer–supplier relationship across the supply chain. The analysis is based on data collected from different secondary sources, including Walmart’s corporate sustainability reports. Findings: Using Walmart’s relationship with Tazreen Fashions Limited around the Tazreen factory fire incident as a case study, it explains that the practices which attempt to symbolically demonstrate accountability from social audits need to shift to a more continuous and sincere demonstration of accountability through the social audit process. For this to occur, the cognitive and pragmatic approaches that international buyers have previously used in auditing their supply firms’ social responsibility are no longer sufficient to achieve societal legitimacy. Instead, a moral turn needs to underpin the intentions and actions of these buyers to maintain legitimacy and demonstrate accountability across the supply industry in developing economies. Originality/value: The findings of the study answer the questions raised in the extant literature about the expectation from social auditing and whether social auditing serves to ensure corporate accountability. The paper contributes to the policymaking discussion of how social auditing can be configured to include a legal provision to ensure that social auditing is not a parroting tool for corporations.","Rahim M.M., Kuruppu S.C., Islam M.T.",Social auditing in the supply chain: business legitimisation strategy rather than a change agent,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139134426&doi=10.1108%2fMEDAR-06-2021-1322&partnerID=40&md5=3101ec9f0141b13f7f94bc1571f9a8f6
Multinational Business Review,"Purpose: This paper aims to examine the state of research on environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance in the context of multinational business research. This paper discusses research progress as well as various issues and complexities associated with using ESG ratings in cross-country studies and for assessing the performance of multinational enterprises (MNE) and emerging market multinationals (EMNEs). Design/methodology/approach: The paper identifies emerging literature that focuses on tracking the development and uptake of ESG ratings in the international context. It discusses three emerging research streams: Research examining the ESG-financial performance relationship in emerging markets, research tracking the ESG performance of multinationals in the various countries and regions they are operating, and frameworks for assessing ESG-related risks on a country level. Findings: While the emerging body of work adds an important dimension to the identification and awareness of ESG issues globally, numerous unresolved issues become evident. ESG frameworks have been built to assess corporate sustainability as it relates to firms in their “home” countries (typically with a focus on developed countries), with limited applicability and transferability to emerging markets. International firm activities are often not captured in detail and not comprehensively mapped across firm subsidiaries and a firm’s corporate supply chain where ESG issues are prone to happen, and ESG scores do not comprehensively integrate views and voices from various local stakeholders that are impacted by firm activities, particularly indigenous communities. Research limitations/implications: Research on ESG ratings in the context of multinational business research is generally sparse and fragmented, thus creating opportunities for future research to expand on existing and emerging findings. Practical implications: The paper creates awareness of issues to consider when using ESG ratings in cross-country studies and for assessing the ESG performance of MNEs and EMNEs: ESG scores can be subject to bias and are not weighted by materiality, which can be misleading for portfolio construction and performance measurement purposes. Managers need to be aware that ESG scores are often not capturing ESG issues occurring in supply chains and ESG issues affecting local communities.

Industrial Management and Data Systems,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate that how to mitigate the weaker party's risk perception in imbalanced supply chain relationships by framing contracts according to complexity and recurrence. The level of information technology (IT) integration is considered as the moderator influencing the effectuation of contract framing. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a questionnaire survey with 229 firms involved in imbalanced supply chains. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The authors found contractual complexity positively influenced performance and relational risk, while contractual recurrence negatively impacted performance and relational risk. This study further reveals the positive moderating effect of IT integration in influencing contractual complexity on relational risk and performance risk and the negative impact of IT integration in influencing contractual recurrence on relational risk and performance risk. Research limitations/implications: Overall, this study posits the coordinating role of contracts in reducing the weaker party's risk perception in imbalanced supply chain relationships. Practical implications: The authors concluded by illustrating how to customize contracts based on the level of IT integration to maximize their role in reducing risk perception. Originality/value: This study is embedded in imbalanced supply chain relationship, aiming to solve the problem of high-risk perception held by the weaker party, which is a salient threat to the sustainability of collaboration.

Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the current state of research on sustainability-related manufacturing trade-offs (i.e. giving preference and priority to one dimension over others) that affect suppliers in developed and less developed countries (LDCs). There is growing pressure on suppliers to adopt sustainable practices into their global supply chains. Successfully implementing all three dimensions of the triple bottom line (TBL) imperative can provide organizations with an added capability and potentially result in competitive advantage and a focus on sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the long run. However, designing supply chains for achieving the TBL requires suppliers to recognize and overcome numerous trade-offs. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review comprising 71 papers published between 2004 and 2020 was undertaken using a content analysis approach to identify trade-offs affecting suppliers. Findings: This study firstly identified eight sustainability-related trade-offs affecting suppliers from a TBL perspective in both developed and LDCs, consequently, allowing for a detailed discussion on trade-off factors and conditions unique to both developed and LDCs. Together, these findings enable this study to present initiatives and investment-related decisions for supply chains from a TBL perspective.

Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the interlinks between different forms of organisational culture (OC), supply chain (SC) integration, green supply chain management (GSCM) practices. It adopts a green human resource management (GHRM) perspective on knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) dynamics to shed light on the drivers that facilitate the implementation of green practices along with the SC. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a quantitative approach through a survey administered to 381 formally appointed Italian SC managers, combining two methodological approaches, namely, the collection of self-reported information regarding the perceived OC, SC integration and GSCM practices in respondent’s organisations and an experimental design aimed at collecting the expected links between GHRM and the firm’s performance in different neutral conditions. Findings: The results highlight that it is necessary to observe the disaggregated paths that link the different types of OC and dimensions of SC integration to benefit from a path-specific rationale for each GSCM practice. Insights on how different dimensions of SC integration mediate the relations between different OCs and GSCM practices, in the light of the role played by KSAs in the pursuit of the firm’s sustainable performance, reveal the relative importance of establishing strong relationships with customers and among the actors involved in the production process. Practical implications: This paper provides directions for collaboration among SC and HR managers in the pursuit of GSCM. Originality/value: This paper adopts an original classification of both OC and SC integration, identifying the existence of previously unrevealed nexuses.

Benchmarking,"Purpose: This paper aims to propose an integrative economic model of the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and performance prism based on concurrent engineering and developed balanced scorecard (BSC). Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the supplier aspect added to the basic BSC framework, a quality function deployment (QFD) developed in four phases and the economic GRI priorities were determined. Finally, the outcomes of QFD were used in Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking the economic indicators. Findings: The indicators of financial interpretation, risks and opportunities had the first rank in learning and growth, internal processes, customer and financial BSC aspects, and they had the second rank only in the suppliers' BSC aspect. Research limitations/implications: In this paper, merely the economic indicators of the GRI standard was studied, and no comparison was made between the variables of the other standards and the GRI standard. Originality/value: The most important contribution of this study is merging the supplier aspect and BSC based on the concept of suppliers, inputs, process, outputs and customers (SIPOC) in supply chain analysis.

Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: This paper argues that the closures will cause regressive rather than progressive modern slavery shifts as the necessity of survival prevails over addressing modern slavery risks within supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: In the spring of 2020, global clothing retailers were advised or ordered to close physical stores due to lockdown measures of the COVID-19 pandemic and many supply chains temporarily halted production. This paper explains how pre-pandemic modern slavery advancements will be detrimentally affected as a result of societal lockdowns and apparel retail closures around the world. Findings: Two consequences of lockdowns are highlighted, which will have negative implications on modern slavery progress. These are the exploitation of vulnerable people, which includes higher exploitation of those already involved in modern slavery and increased risk of exploitation for those susceptible to being drawn (back) into modern slavery and; the need for repetition of previous work completed by external stakeholders or in some cases, a better alternative. Practical implications: The pandemic itself causes friction between immediate response solutions and long-term modern slavery goals. Social implications: In response to modern slavery drivers, governments may need to fill governance gaps, to control the power of corporations and to reconsider migration regulation. Originality/value: The COVID-19 lockdowns and subsequent supply chain disruptions were unforeseen. This paper argues that there are significant negative effects on the developments in modern slavery eradication made in the past 10 years. As businesses struggled for basic survival, the apparel manufacturing sector has been detrimentally affected as upstream labourers are now at higher risk from the increased likelihood of modern slavery violations.","Cole R., Shirgholami Z.",The outlook for modern slavery in the apparel sector in a post-lockdown economy,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107799759&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-06-2020-0245&partnerID=40&md5=9512dc2e61e441379725acdab1de4612
Management Decision,"Purpose: This paper discusses how learning-by-doing (LBD) criterion can be used to evaluate the sustainability of supply chains. This paper assesses the impacts of teamwork on the LBD criterion. Besides, the effect of the internship of new labors on the LBD criterion is discussed. Design/methodology/approach: The repeat of a task leads to a gradual improvement in the efficiency of production systems. LBD occurs by accumulating knowledge and skills in multiple periods. LBD can be used to study changes in the efficiency. Efficiency can be improved by accumulating knowledge and skills. In this paper, the LBD criterion is projected on learning curve (LC) models. Furthermore, the LC models are fitted to the supply chains. Each supply chain may have a unique LC model. A minimum difference is set between the current performance of decision making unit (DMU) and the estimated performance of DMU based on DMU's LC. Hence, a point in which the LBD occurs is determined. Findings: This paper develops an inverse network dynamic data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to assess the sustainability of supply chains DMUs. Findings imply that the LBD criterion plays an important role in assessing the sustainability of supply chains. Furthermore, managers should increase the internships and teamwork to get more benefit from the LBD criterion.

Critical Perspectives on International Business,"Purpose: This paper examines the role of government procurement as a social policy mechanism within a multilateral open trading system. Government regulations globally are being transformed to foster more responsible business conduct in multinational enterprises (MNEs). Yet, concern that sustainability may present a discriminatory barrier to trade has stalled the progress of sustainable public procurement (SPP) at the international level, raising questions regarding the role and scope of the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) to align taxpayer-funded contracts with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. Design/methodology/approach: With a focus on social sustainability, this paper reviews the grey and academic literature to assess the changing landscape of public procurement policy and supply chain legislation in high-income countries. Findings: Frontrunner nations are adopting a mandatory approach to sustainable public procurement and due diligence legislation is elevating supply chain risk from reputational damage to legal liability. While technological innovation and the clean, green production of manufactured goods dominates the sustainable public procurement literature, the social aspects of sustainability poverty, inequality and human rights remain underrepresented. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this paper is limited to the examination of government procurement covered by the WTO-GPA (2012). Smaller value contracts, under the WTO-GPA thresholds and the category of defence are beyond the scope of the paper. Social implications: The paper focusses on the underserved topic of social sustainability in business-to-government (B2G) – business to government – supply chains arguing that for responsible business conduct to become a competitive advantage, it must be more meaningfully rewarded on the demand-side of all taxpayer-funded contracts in organisation for economic co-operation and development countries. The paper introduces the idea of priceless procurement as a mechanism to build system capacity in the evaluation of non-financial sustainability objectives.

European Journal of Innovation Management,"Purpose: This paper examines the status and evolution of green innovation research from 1948 to 2018. Design/methodology/approach: Using a systematic review of 293 peer-reviewed scholarly articles, the authors classify journal outlets, publication trends, research methods (research type, approach, design), themes/topics focus, country and regional distribution and theoretical perspectives, identifying main trends. They apply mixed methodologies, integrating both content and descriptive analyses. Findings: Results reveal the following critical conclusions: (1) publication trends disclose a steady growth of interest in green innovation research in the last decade (2011–2018), with most of the articles appearing in top-ranked journal outlets; (2) empirical studies involving quantitative surveys dominate the field over other methods like experiments, case studies (qualitative) and conceptual models; (3) research themes/topics are multi-perspectives, covering management and strategic dimension of green innovation (e.g. green innovation integration and adoption strategy; collaboration and networking in green innovation; green innovation management systems, green supply chain management, etc.), performance (financial, non-financial and both), drivers/antecedents and consumer green behavior; however, the “management and strategy” papers are by far higher; (4) studies are preponderately multi-country focused, concentrated in Europe and Australasia, with a low concentration in emerging markets like Africa and South America; And (5) the field lacks the adoption and development of novel theories. So far, the research fields principally focus on the “Porter hypothesis” and resource-based view in terms of the theory-driven studies. Based on these findings, knowledge gaps are identified, as are limitations and actionable agenda for future research. Originality/value: As the first systematic review to adopt a comprehensive, holistic approach in synthesizing and summarizing research vis-à-vis the phenomenon of green innovation, the study offers practitioners and researchers an insightful understanding of the relevant issues that have been investigated on green innovation, thereby anchoring the evolutions for further sustainable-oriented research and improvement in management practices.","Oduro S., Maccario G., De Nisco A.",Green innovation: a multidomain systematic review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099748344&doi=10.1108%2fEJIM-10-2020-0425&partnerID=40&md5=92d73a849ad7c440afee27d0c724e3c9
British Food Journal,"Purpose: This paper investigates how sustainability requirements modify supply strategies at different levels in the food industry companies. The paper integrates single supply decisions into firm-level supply strategy and views supply strategy as one coherent strategy in which the decision-making is based on the values and principles of a firm. Design/methodology/approach: The paper captures the decade of change and studies the renewal of supply strategy by utilising two qualitative data sets with a ten years of difference. The data contain 41 interviews from a retailer and 5 of its food supplier companies. Findings: Results confirm that a decade ago only minor attention was channelled towards sustainability whereas today sustainability is a key driver behind supply decisions and supply strategies because firms need to respond to sustainability requirements and challenges. The study presents a framework for analysing different levels (firm, category and supply market levels) of changes and sustainability requirements faced by food companies and their supply strategies. Originality/value: Previously, sustainability has rarely been connected to firm-level supply strategy. This study presents the supply strategy elements that were important for Finnish food industry companies over a decade ago and matches these elements to the needs of today’s firms. As a result, the study incorporates the concept of sustainability with the supply strategy frameworks.","Kähkönen A.-K., Lintukangas K.",Towards sustainable supply strategy in the food industry: the case of Finland,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127168762&doi=10.1108%2fBFJ-03-2021-0257&partnerID=40&md5=b6c328dd2db61aefc792b09a69d611de
British Food Journal,"Purpose: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the cross-disciplinary literature on the drivers, barriers and performance outcomes of sustainable packaging to understand the current state of research in this field and identify research opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review is conducted within no time limit. The Methodi Ordinatio methodology was applied that resulted in retaining 48 relevant and high impact articles published in 26 academic journals with various scopes. Findings: Seven key drivers are identified and defined: the integrative and collaborative supply chain, environmental capabilities and resources, market-based instruments, cost reduction, consumer pressure, competitive advantage, and regulatory pressure. Three main barriers are identified and defined: cost/benefit ambiguity, additional costs and complex trade-offs between packaging requirements. The review shows that the drivers and barriers to packaging sustainability are contingent on the firm size. Sustainable packaging positively affects the environmental, social and economic performance; however, its operational performance requires a proactive and integrated supply chain. The results highlight the importance of integrated packaging decisions at three different levels to improve packaging sustainability: vertical and horizontal integration, upstream and downstream integration, and product-packaging integration. The authors developed research propositions and provided insightful directions for future research.

Benchmarking,"Purpose: This paper presents a systematic literature review of the various aspects of reverse logistics (RL) and closed-loop supply chains (CLSC) in implementing and achieving circular economy (CE) motives. CE is identified as a method of embracing imperishability into the economic structure, helping shift from a linear to a condition leading to ecological and social benefits. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic literature was used to review a total of 80 peer-reviewed articles are included in the study and covers different concepts related to the implementation of CE, such as cost-saving, network design, sustainable RL, waste management and extended producer responsibility. Findings: The findings reveal that the research in the domain is in a growing phase, and in recent years, a lot of attention has been given by researchers across the globe. However, further research is required in crucial areas for the adoption of CE, such as retail reverse logistics, pharmaceutical industries and resource recycling industry. Practical implications: The study discusses the business needs and solutions for industries. Key enablers and barriers are listed along with the main activities involved in each sector in CLSC. Managers can design a pathway to decide which lever to use to overcome a particular challenge. Originality/value: The work contributes theoretically by developing research themes in RL and CLSC practices applied to CE. It also provides theoretical and practical implications of the study, which can be used as a signboard for further research.","Mishra A., Dutta P., Jayasankar S., Jain P., Mathiyazhagan K.",A review of reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chains in the perspective of circular economy,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130190076&doi=10.1108%2fBIJ-11-2021-0669&partnerID=40&md5=09d0c891c1162d227be5b4b9de9e4003
Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: This paper presents an empirical study of a Syrian refugee workforce in textile export from Jordan. The purpose of this study is to determine the challenges of integrating Syrian refugees into the local workforce and to consider the implications of these challenges for the global supply chain aiming to create stable trade. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected via three face-to-face focus group interviews with refugee workers and managers at a clothing factory site in Al-Duleil, Zarqa. Data were analysed using the Gioia methodology. Findings: Worker attitudes, factory environment, and government support are important factors for refugees' workforce participation. The success of integrating Syrian refugees into the Jordanian workforce was largely a matter of their attitudes, commitment and motivations for taking up manufacturing work. Misconceptions about the roles refugees will undertake were identified, which results in fewer people becoming self-sufficient through employment. Research limitations/implications: This research contributes to understanding refugees' long-term integration in the host country by investigating refugee workers' and their managers' perspectives. Considering the views of multiple stakeholders enrichs the literature on refugees' integration. Social implications: Understanding refugees' perspectives facilitates their integration in the host country which leads to improvement in their wellbeing and quality of life. More broadly, Jordan's approach to integrating refugees into the economy is seen as a development opportunity rather than a crisis to be handled. Originality/value: Rather than focus on the procedures of integrating refugees in the host country, this study provides the voices of refugee migrant workers themselves, thereby offering a more complete picture of those factors shaping refugees' (dis)integration in local communities.","Cole R., Al-Ma'aitah N., Al Hasan R.",Integrating Syrian refugee workers in global supply chains: creating opportunities for stable trade,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129131477&doi=10.1108%2fJHLSCM-03-2021-0024&partnerID=40&md5=8e861341db2e17a8ca78582503eae9ef
International Journal of Clothing Science and Technology,"Purpose: This paper studies the textile supply chain tactical planning under demand fuzziness through considering environmentally friendly and social responsibility. Hence, carbon emission in textile production and transportation is considered along with supply chain profitability. Design/methodology/approach: The authors present a fuzzy multi-objective mathematical optimization model with credibilistic chance constraints to determine the fabric procurement quantities and production plan under uncertainty. The solution procedure makes use of credibility measure and fuzzy aggregation operator to attain compromise solutions. Findings: A trade-off among carbon emissions, social performance and supply chain total profit is conducted. The analyses indicate the importance of transportation costs and carbon emission while determining the supply chain's tactical plan.

Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,"Purpose: This research aims to develop a decision support framework to determine the optimal strategies for mitigating supply chain sustainability (SCS) barriers. Design/methodology/approach: To operationalize the research objectives, both qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted. The qualitative phase comprised a field study, while a quality function deployment approach and optimisation technique were used in the quantitative phase. Findings: This study finds that a lack of support from top management and cost and utility supply problems are the primary barriers to SCS. This study also finds that incentives for suppliers to implement sustainability practices, awareness building among supply chain members and supplier development are the main strategies to mitigate the barriers. Practical implications: The findings of this study will assist the supply chain managers in prioritizing sustainability barriers and implementing the optimal strategies to mitigate the barriers.

European Business Review,"Purpose: This research aims to review how current supply chain management (SCM) research addresses cultural issues, presents a critical assessment of literature and discusses future research avenues. Design/methodology/approach: The literature is reviewed using systematic literature review, bibliometric citation analysis and content analysis. A total of between 1995 and 2019 in Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science’s database. Findings: Descriptive data related to chronological evolution of literature, geographical location, influential papers and methodology are presented. Four main research areas were categorized, namely, papers on SC integration and performance; research on continuous improvement and lean initiatives; studies on the role of culture in sustainability, corporate social responsibility and green practices; and studies on emerging topics of research. Most studies focused on organizational culture frameworks, adopted a static approach to culture and targeted mainly developed countries and Asian emerging countries. A research agenda is suggested based on a multilevel cultural framework including operational and SCM culture. Research limitations/implications: Practitioners and researchers will gain a greater understanding of how cultural issues have been addressed in current literature. A multilevel framework is proposed based on the concept of “operational” and “SCM culture”, to address some of the issues identified in current literature.

Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management,"Purpose: This research develops a model to improve the quality and freshness of sold vegetables through a funding program between farmers and retailers. Through this program, retailers who are interested in the distribution of first quality vegetables provide funds to farmers to increase their production this type of vegetables through the acquisition of new machinery, technology, or training. Design/methodology/approach: The problem is solved through a multi-objective mathematical programming model that simultaneously optimizes the supply chain profits, the waste of vegetables, the economic unfairness among farmers, the unfairness in the distribution of funds, and the freshness of sold vegetables. The ε-constraint method is used to obtain several non-dominated solutions to the problem after linearizing the non-lineal equations related to the unfairness objectives. Findings: Results show that it is possible to improve the indicators related to the vegetable waste, the economic unfairness, the unfairness in the distribution of funds and the freshness of vegetables while maintaining similar to optimal profits for the supply chain. Interesting trade-offs between the five objectives are identified, which can be used by supply chain members to select the most appropriate solution to be implemented in the real supply chain. Originality/value: This research models aspects relevant to the agri-food sector that have not been previously modelled for the problem under study. The main novelties of this paper are the consideration of the limited shelf life of the vegetables as well as the requirement of ensuring a minimum freshness at the moment of their sale, the price dependence on the quality and freshness of vegetables, the optimization of vegetable waste and the freshness of vegetables sold, as well as the joint optimization of the five previously defined objectives..","Esteso A., Alemany M.M.E., Ortiz Á., Panetto H.",Increasing the Sustainability of a Fresh Vegetables Supply Chain Through the Optimization of Funding Programs: A Multi-Objective Mathematical Programming Approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131070830&doi=10.3926%2fjiem.3719&partnerID=40&md5=caee0121f96f8c1dbf965ee99263edfc

British Food Journal,"Purpose: This study aims to ascertain the extent to which a cooperative controlling a wine supply chain implements a performance measurement system (PMS) that monitors the effects of a circular economy (CE) strategy, developed through partnerships, on the economic and environmental sustainability of the value chain. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzes the characteristics of the closed-loop business model and uses the PMS to assess the contribution of CE partnerships to the sustainability of the value chain. The case study is based on interviews conducted on the cooperative's top management and supplemented with an analysis of external reports, related documents and direct observations. Findings: The PMS was underpinned by enterprise resource planning (ERP), through which CE indicators control for the benefits generated on behalf of the cooperative and its CE partners. Originality/value: Given the paucity of the studies that address the performance measurement of CE at the supply chain level and its relation to sustainability, this study sheds light on the role that PMS can play in tracking the contribution of CE partnerships to the sustainability of a wine value chain operating in agro-waste valorization.

Journal of Global Operations and Strategic Sourcing,"Purpose: This study aims to formulate a conceptual sustainable framework for developing a trusted, reliable, scalable, transparent, traceable and sustainable agri-food supply chain in a developing country so that it minimizes wastage and increases the efficiency levels of agri-produce and its usage. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a rigorous review of extant literature, case studies and the interview method for theory building, using blockchain technology (BT) as a subject. Further, the study builds a framework to relate blockchain solutions to the challenges faced by the agri-supply chain. Notably, the use of BT in the agri-food supply chain is a relatively new area of study. Findings: Limitations of using BT 3.0 in a diverse supply chain like the food sector, especially in a developing country such as India, may be overcome by adopting BT 4.0 and could change the country’s face by controlling inefficiencies and ensuring transparency, helping in good governance, improving the humanitarian supply chain and integrating the bottom of the pyramid to the main economy. Based on the findings, this study proposes BT 4.0 for the agri-supply chain in India to deal with the current issues of demand-supply gap, wastages of agri-produce, unequal distribution of profit among agriproduct producers and logistics suppliers and ensuring sustainability. Research limitations/implications: Results in this study have been derived from a specific demographic condition in India. Future research with other demographic conditions may be replicated. BT is a new technology product, and its effectiveness is yet to be established. Practical implications: The outcome of this study provides the application of BT 4.0 in the area of the agri-food supply chain. The BT 4.0 framework has been developed on studying a few cases that either implemented BT or were in the testing phase. The benefits of the agri-food supply chain vis-à-vis its overall social well-being may be achieved on the successful implementation of the framework, despite existing complexities in the food supply chain. Further research on this subject may help the other dimensions of the complexity of adopting BT 4.0. Both practitioners and policymakers from developing countries can, therefore, use the findings of this study to analyze BT 4.0 and address the concerns of the agri-food supply chain.

It is fairly transparent, and therefore sustainable supply chain practices may be achieved easily.","Kumar A., Srivastava S.K., Singh S.",How blockchain technology can be a sustainable infrastructure for the agrifood supply chain in developing countries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126241243&doi=10.1108%2fJGOSS-08-2021-0058&partnerID=40&md5=3c412b3216dcf0712752dda19a33a7c2
Innovation and Management Review,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate how Suzano implemented shared value (SV) strategies to reconcile profitability and social welfare by joining innovation and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use an exploratory, descriptive qualitative approach using the interactive qualitative analysis (IQA) method. IQA procedures and protocols were operationalized to get to Suzano's SV system. Primary data were collected through in-depth interviews. Content analyses were conducted with the support of Atlas.ti software. Findings: The most relevant findings of this research are (1) Suzano developed a unique strategy to spread collaborative and innovation mindset throughout the organization called “innovability”; (2) Suzano's effort to understand local community's demands and a collaborative work raised the companies' profitability and enabled prosperity for the community; (3) the IQA procedures and protocols enabled the development of a Suzano's SV system, composed of nine elements and their relationships. They are purpose-driven leadership, materiality matrix, social welfare, profitability, ecosystem, business results, social results, impact and sustainable economic development, (4) purpose-driven leadership is the system's driver. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited to studying the implementation of the SV as a strategy to reconcile profitability and welfare. Despite the findings about the company's conflicts with local communities and the strategy with small family producers, other studies could evaluate the strategy of different stakeholders, such as the supply chain since Suzano is one of the leading companies of paper sales in Brazil. Practical implications: By using IQA protocols and the nine elements of this study, other researchers may replicate it to investigate the adoption of SV strategies in other organizations. The SV system developed in this study may be used by business leaders to disseminate the SV policies and practices in their organization. Social implications: The company adopts the three forms of SV -reconceiving products and markets, redefining productivity in the value chain and developing clusters with the local community-as strategies for sustainable and collaborative management. Suzano was led to get involved with the problems and conflicts' root causes. By doing so, the company unlocked innovation as a driver to achieve sustainable and responsible management. For them, innovation is in service of sustainability, creating innovability. Both concepts are part of the whole organization culture and practice. Innovability is Suzano's essence, and SV strategies are the means to scale it. Originality/value: The originality of the paper relies on the method and techniques used to gather and analyze primary data, in which the unit of analysis (Suzano's SV strategy) was considered a system. Major findings were validated with research participants.

Industrial Management and Data Systems,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) through the lens of socio-technical system (STS) theory. Specifically, it examines the individual and synergistic effects of social and technical integration on two main sustainability practices (i.e. sustainable production and sustainable sourcing). Supply chain uncertainty is further explored as a key environmental factor. Design/methodology/approach: A moderated joint effects model was hypothesized. A sample of 759 manufacturing firms was used to test the proposed hypotheses by hierarchical linear regression. Findings: The results show that both social and technical integration have positive effects on sustainable production and sustainable sourcing. Interestingly, social and technical integration have an enhancing synergistic effect on sustainable sourcing, which is further strengthened in high-uncertainty supply chains. Originality/value: This study extends the application of STS theory in the SSCM setting. It enriches the sustainability literature by uncovering the impact of the interplay among the firm's social, technical and environmental systems on sustainable production and sourcing, and offers system-wide insights for sustainability management.","Shan S., Shou Y., Kang M., Park Y.",The effects of socio-technical integration on sustainability practices: a supply chain perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120658353&doi=10.1108%2fIMDS-05-2021-0295&partnerID=40&md5=00372ced57c0a027b2f0b09ed825c39c
Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the conditional direct and indirect effects of supply chain relational capital (RC) on supply chain sustainability via sustainability governance. Design/methodology/approach: In line with the study’s aims, a quantitative survey-based approach was adopted. This study uses a random sample of 272 manufacturing firms from the apparel industry in Bangladesh. This study assesses the measurement model using partial least square-based structural equation modelling and test the proposed hypotheses using the Hayes PROCESS. Findings: The results reveal that the indirect effect of supply chain RC on supply chain sustainability via sustainability governance is significant. While at low levels of network complexity (NC), the conditional indirect effect of supply chain RC on supply chain sustainability via sustainability governance is significant, this study finds that such indirect effects are insignificant at high levels of NC. This study further shows that NC positively moderates the relationship between supply chain RC and supply chain sustainability.

Society and Business Review,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the domestic sustainable consumption practices in Indian households and the motivations to do so. These practices also contribute to environment management and its impact on Indian society through the action of reusing, reducing and recycling of consumed products for two generations, namely, the Baby Boomer and the Generation Z. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory qualitative research was undertaken in which the data were collected through personal interview technique with 64 respondents including males and females from the generations of Baby Boomers and Generation Z of Indian households. Findings: The theoretical framework of the 3R was extended to inculcate broader themes like awareness, action and motivation for the domestic sustainable activities. The findings conclude that the domestic sustainable consumption practices of Baby Boomers in India were far more advanced than their Generation Z counterparts. These two generations differed in their awareness sources, actions of sustainability and the motivations for undergoing the domestic sustainable activities. Managerial implications have been framed for organisations like start-ups, sustainable firms, government organisations and second-hand product vendors. These practices in such organisations could help in the enhancement of circular economy through the domestic waste disposal. Practical implications: Practical implications are for organisations that can consider the domestic sustainability consumption practices while planning their strategies to maximise stakeholder satisfaction through their corporate social responsibility initiatives and create more goodwill and growth avenues for their businesses. Originality/value: Where most of the past literature concentrates on the supply chain and manufacturing initiatives of sustainability or sustainable consumption, very few studies look at the angle of domestic sustainability initiative and how they could be linked to the initiative of circular economy.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Purpose: This study analyzes how supply chain leadership (SCL), supply chain followership (SCF) and green supply chain integration (GSCI) can contribute to green new product development (GNPD) and performance (PRF) through the effects of green innovation (GRI), considering the moderator role of customer pressure (CPR). In doing so, it provides new insights that can aid in understanding the importance of collaborative behavior in the supply chain that promotes sustainable benefits for companies and their stakeholders, stimulating green innovation as a key to making business more circular. Method: ology: Using a structured questionnaire, this study gathers data from a cross-sectional sample of 425 supply chain partners of Portugal's biggest energy supplier. Structural equation modelling is used to test the proposed hypotheses, and the impact of customer pressure on the suggested relationships is assessed through a multi-group analysis. Findings: The findings suggest that SCL, SCF and GSCI positively impact GRI. Additionally, this study reveals that GNPD has a positive impact on PRF. Supply chain customer pressure appears to moderate some of the proposed relationships. Implications/originality: This article provides some empirical evidence of the influence of SCL, SCF and GSCI on organizational value creation, contributing to a better understanding of the impacts of green innovation approaches on business sustainability. The overall results may support the importance of collaborative behavior in the supply chain for creating value for business, responding at the same time to the environmental sustainability challenges that humanity is facing, considering the role of customer pressure in moderating these relationships. Results show that, by being greener, a company may be more competitive, thus highlighting the importance of the collaboration between responsible and committed leaders and proactive followers for creating a better future for all. Limitations: The research considered the suppliers of only one company. The relationships between variables need to be explored in other practical case studies and longitudinal research to improve the potential for extrapolating generalizations and establishing clear causalities.","Fontoura P., Coelho A.",How to boost green innovation and performance through collaboration in the supply chain: Insights into a more sustainable economy,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129967526&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.132005&partnerID=40&md5=c48b4272eb54d43ad0b1ae54964c1f50
Journal of Enterprise Information Management,"Purpose: This study caries a survey approach using the expert's interview and literature to select the important criteria to select and evaluate the third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs) in manufacturing companies. In total, 16 criteria are selected to evaluate 3PRLPs, and these criteria are classified on the basis of three main elements of sustainable growth, including economic, social and environmental development. Therefore, a hybrid decision-making approach is utilized to evaluate and rank the 3PRLPs in manufacturing companies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a new decision-making approach using the projection model and entropy method under the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set to assess 3PRLPs based on sustainability perspectives. A survey approach using the literature review and experts' interview is conducted to select the important criteria to select and evaluate 3PRLPs in manufacturing companies. To assess the criteria weight, the entropy method is used. Further, the projection model is applied to prioritize the 3PRLPs option. Sensitivity analysis and comparison process are performed in order to test and validate the developed method. Findings: The presented methodology uses the benefits to determine the former for measuring the parameters considered and the latter for rating the 3PRLPs alternatives. A case study is taken to 3PRLPs in the manufacturing industry to illustrate the efficiency of the introduced hybrid method. The findings of this study indicate that when facing uncertainties of input and qualitative data, the proposed solution delivers more viable performance and therefore is suitable for wider uses. Originality/value: The conception of the circular economy (CE) comes from the last 4 decades, and in recent years, tremendous attention has been carried out on this concept, partially because of the availability of natural resources in the world and changes in consumption behaviour of developed and developing nations. Remarkably, the sustainable supply chain management concepts are established parallel to the CE foundations, grown in industrial practice and ecology literature for a long time. In fact, to reduce the environmental concerns, sustainable supply chain management seeks to diminish the materials' flow and minimize the unintentional harmful consequences of consumption and production processes. Customers and governments are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental sustainability in the CE era, which allows businesses to concentrate more resources on reverse logistics (RLs). However, most manufacturing enterprises have been inspired to outsource their RL operations to competent 3PRLPs due to limited resources and technological limitations. In RL outsourcing practices, the selection of the best 3PRLP is helpfully valuable due to its potential to increase the economic viability of enterprises and boost their long-term growth.","Chen L., Duan D., Mishra A.R., Alrasheedi M.",Sustainable third-party reverse logistics provider selection to promote circular economy using new uncertain interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy-projection model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106304268&doi=10.1108%2fJEIM-02-2021-0066&partnerID=40&md5=9de5b7acaa82932f693bc7e0a8d3898f
Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: This study examines the relationship between supply chain stakeholder pressure from customers and suppliers for the adoption of social and environmental sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices given the simultaneous conditional effects of both entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and sustainability orientation (SO). Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a survey of US firms focused on their relationship with their top supplier or buyer by spend. This study used conditional process analysis to measure the relationship between stakeholder pressure and adoption of SSCM practices as well as the double moderation effects of EO and SO on this relationship. Findings: The results show that both EO and SO simultaneously function as moderators of the effect of supply chain stakeholder pressure on the adoption of social and environmental SSCM practices. However, EO will only get firms so far in the adoption of SSCM practices. Once a strong SO takes effect, higher practice adoption ensues but the effect of stakeholder pressure weakens. Practical implications: For those firms that have lower levels of SO, EO and supply chain stakeholder pressure are still essential drivers for the adoption of SSCM practice. The results of this study suggest that focal firms should work closely with suppliers to increase their levels of SO while also maintaining pressure for the adoption of SSCM practices. Originality/value: This study shows the concurrent effect of two organizational level drivers on the adoption of SSCM practices, indicating that efforts in developing a strong SO are more likely to prepare firms for the adoption of SSCM practices.","Vidal N.G., Spetic W., Croom S., Marshall D.",Supply chain stakeholder pressure for the adoption of sustainable supply chain practices: examining the roles of entrepreneurial and sustainability orientations,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134607928&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-08-2021-0370&partnerID=40&md5=5c9325d3d3260dca57dd1313e37bb85c

International Journal of Logistics Management,"Purpose: This study explores the sustainable supply chain trade-offs in the electronics industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a social media analytics approach and analyses Twitter posts from August 2017 to December 2021. Thematic analysis is applied to discover the pattern in sustainable supply chain trade-offs based on the consumers' perceptions. In addition, a chi-square test was used to measure whether a relationship exists between product groups and sustainable supply chain perceptions. Findings: The results indicate that environmental practices are the most frequent topic among consumers on social media. Further, although basic sustainable supply chain practices are prioritised in the environmental aspect, advanced sustainable supply chain practices take precedence over basic ones in the social dimension. The result from the chi-square independence test reveals that there is no significant relationship between different products and perceptions of consumers except for economically advanced sustainable supply chain practices. Practical implications: The main implications of the present study are to offer a fast and efficient method to marketers and companies for discovering customer perceptions. In a way, they can identify where the quality of practices needs to improve in their supply chains to gain customer satisfaction. Additionally, the authors suggest industries declare their trade-off preferences between sustainable supply chain practices transparently.

International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,"Purpose: This study focuses on the environmental assessment of European copper production. Life cycle assessment is applied to analyse copper cathode production in Sweden, including its mining (an open-pit mine) and refining (pyrometallurgy), and using two combinations of software and databases: SimaPro software with ecoinvent database and GaBi software with GaBi database. The results are compared with results from other case studies from literature. Methods: A cradle-to-gate LCA was conducted considering 1 tonne of copper as functional unit. The inventory for the foreground system was elaborated using primary data gathered by the staff from the mine, the concentrator and the smelter. For the background data, LCA databases are used considering datasets for the Swedish market whenever possible. As the smelter has multiple useful outputs, economic allocation was applied at the inventory level. The calculation method CML-IA baseline 3.5 was considered for both combinations of software and database, reporting all the impact categories of the method plus the Cumulative Energy Demand. Results and discussion: The inventory of the system and the main environmental hotspots were presented, such as the explosives for blasting (due to their supply chain) or the electricity used in the concentrator. The results obtained with the two combinations of LCA software and databases yield large differences for categories such as abiotic depletion (7.5 times higher for SimaPro and ecoinvent), possibly due to differences in the system boundaries of the databases and the characterisation factors of the method. Although the case study has a relatively high cumulative energy demand (140/168 kMJ/tonne Cu) compared to other mines, its performance in global warming (3.5/4.7 tonne CO2eq/tonne Cu) is much better due to the low greenhouse gas emissions from electricity, which shows that the electricity mix is a key aspect. Conclusions: The environmental performance of mining depends partially on the specific conditions of the deposit, e.g., the ore grade and the mining type. LCA practitioners should consider the potential different results that can be obtained using different combinations of software and database and exert caution when comparing cases, especially for abiotic depletion, human toxicity and ecotoxicity categories. Finally, the use of renewable energies can be key to improve the environmental sustainability of copper production.","Sanjuan-Delmás D., Alvarenga R.A.F., Lindblom M., Kampmann T.C., van Oers L., Guinée J.B., Dewulf J.",Environmental assessment of copper production in Europe: an LCA case study from Sweden conducted using two conventional software-database setups,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123936022&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-021-02018-5&partnerID=40&md5=5649792c140a41144b295de418dcef3c
International Journal of Logistics Management,"Purpose: This study investigates the impact of supplier visibility on the adoption of sustainable practices and supply chain performance.

International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management,"Purpose: This study proposes a new model for assessing supply chain sustainability risk integrating subjectivity and objectivity of decision-maker. Research has shown the vacancy of study in dealing with the above issue. To fill this research gap, a new decision support model considering the subjectivity and objectivity of decision-makers in assigning the weight of the supply chain risk reprioritization criteria is presented and demonstrated using a case example. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a new decision support model for assessing supply chain sustainability risk based on additional failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) parameters and its integration with preference selection index (PSI) methodology and the Shannon entropy. A case example of the supply chain small and medium enterprise (SME) producing handy crafts has been used in this study. Findings: The result of the study reveals critical sustainability risk dimensions and their risk elements demanding management attention to support realization to a more sustainable business operation. Research limitations/implications: The use of a single case study is often associated as a limitation in the research studies, and this study is based on findings from SMEs in the handy craft sector in a developing country. Nonetheless, future studies may focus on replicating this study using more samples. This preliminary study provides academics and practitioners with an exemplar of supply chain sustainability risk assessment from the SME in a developing country. Practical implications: The result of this study is beneficial for practitioners, particularly owner-managers of SMEs who can use this study as guidance on how to identify and select the critical sustainability risks and plan mitigating strategies accordingly. Originality/value: Scientific effort on appraising criticality of supply chain sustainability risks considering subjectivity and objectivity of decision-maker simultaneously is missing in earlier studies. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first paper applying the PSI and Shannon entropy method and using it for evaluating the impact of supply chain risk based on five sustainability pillars.

International Journal of Logistics Management,"Purpose: This study proposes a systematic and comprehensive circular economy (CE) performance measure as an instrument to operationalize and quantify circularity. It seeks to evaluate the relative contribution of blockchain technology to evaluate various measures in this study. A general research agenda for investigating blockchain capabilities to performance assessment in CE is presented. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical survey data from 32 CE and blockchain experts are collected to inform this study. Inductive reasoning, heatmaps, and a middle-range theory building approach are utilized to generalize theoretical patterns for blockchain support of CE performance assessment and measurement. A series of propositions are then developed as a middle-range theory for the true, false, perceptible, and hidden affordances of blockchain technology capabilities for CE performance measurement. Findings: Overall, sixteen performance measures and metrics are identified and examined. The authors find most of these measures and metrics – based on literature and expert opinion – can be supported using blockchain technology capabilities. Four major blockchain capabilities, transparency and traceability, reliability and security, smart contracts, and incentivization and tokenization are shown to have varying potential support for CE performance assessment. There needs to be an evaluation of true, false, perceptible, and hidden affordances of blockchain technology capabilities for CE performance measurement in future studies.

Kybernetes,"Purpose: To avoid sub-optimization in wheat storage centers, one of the most strategic facilities, it is necessary to review and relocate them to be optimized regularly. The present study aims to propose an integrated method using geographic information systems (GISs) and an appropriate weighting algorithm for the relocation of wheat storage facilities. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the goal mentioned above, sustainability pillars in facility location and relocation are initially developed; afterward, a set of suitable criteria are obtained from various scientific resources. Then, the weight of each sustainable development pillar and its corresponding sub-criteria were identified through utilizing the best–worst method (BWM). By applying the obtained weights in the ArcGIS software package, various geographical layers were designed, and land-use planning, logistics planning and sustainable logistics planning are carried out in the regions. The regions are ranked based on the scores obtained in the processes, and the best regions are selected for sustainable relocation problem. Findings: A case study including 430 regions (counties) in Iran is conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the suggested approach. The study results indicate that Iran possesses a superior state for establishing wheat storage centers in terms of infrastructural and social aspects. Also, it is established that 16% of counties are recognized as sustainable locations for relocating the wheat storage facilities. Research limitations/implications: There is no most suitable analysis of the wheat storage facilities, as well as their strategic position in the supply chain, and there is a lack of considering sustainability in wheat storage facility location, despite the particular importance of it to the supply chain. Practical implications: This framework is applied in an Iranian wheat-bread supply chain to find the best sustainable facilities. It is noted that this algorithm can be applied in other strategic facilities by minor and some major changes.

International Journal of Lean Six Sigma,"Purpose: To deal with the present situation and recover after the COVID-19 pandemic, construction firms are required to recognise the trends in construction supply chain management (CSCM) for the upcoming years and determine the appropriate practices towards the trends for the improvement of construction activities in terms of strategy, tactic and operations. This paper aims to recognise key trends in CSCM and uses these trends as strategic criteria for the evaluation and prioritisation of lean construction (LC) tools at different project phases including design and architectural engineering, planning and control, on-site construction and safety management. Design/methodology/approach: The integrated analytic hierarchy process–Delphi method is used to collect and analyse the data from construction experts to evaluate the importance levels of the CSCM trends and recommend the appropriate tools for LC practices to improve project performances. Findings: Seven key CSCM trends are identified: lean supply chain management (SCM), supply chain (SC) integration, SC standardisation, SC problem-solving, SC information-sharing, SC flexibility and SC sustainability. Based on these trends, a set of prioritised lean tools are suggested for LC practices, in which “virtual design construction” (VDC) and “last planner system” are considered as the central tools. These two LC practices can be integrated with other effective tools to support the strategic, tactical and operational targets in construction supply chain (CSC) projects. Research limitations/implications: This study gives the managerial implications by developing an application framework of LC practices for CSC projects. The framework promotes “VDC” as a strategic tool for the phase of design and architectural engineering and considers “last planner system” as the central LC practice for the phase of project planning and control. The framework also focuses on the improvement of efficiency in construction operations by taking into account the aspects of on-site collaboration, problem-solving, improvement and safety. Originality/value: Up to date, there is still a lack of researches in classifying and prioritising the significant LC tools for each project phase to deal with CSC issues in both breadth and depth. Thus, this study is performed to provide construction managers with the awareness of CSCM trends on which they can focus to have strategic criteria for selecting LC practices to improve CSC performances.","Le P.L., Nguyen N.T.D.",Prospect of lean practices towards construction supply chain management trends,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109385025&doi=10.1108%2fIJLSS-06-2020-0071&partnerID=40&md5=20914207ea375ba22a5debc2db770770
International Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Purpose: To study the learning processes and mechanisms involved in sustainability-oriented supplier development (SSD), including how knowledge is transmitted by the buyer and how it is received, understood and internalised by the supplier. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory longitudinal multi-case study approach is adopted. The research context is a social SSD project focusing on occupational health and safety (OHS) management at four supplier factories. The paper draws on the constructs of absorptive capacity and boundary objects. Findings: The development of a supplier's absorptive capacity for OHS management is triggered by the transfer of boundary objects that are created by the buyer. Findings suggest that each supplier starts explorative learning in a similar and passive way in order to accept the knowledge, but then each supplier proactively transforms and exploits the knowledge through continuous sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring loops that develop the boundary objects in a way that fits their own needs and contexts, incorporating the objects into organisational structures and routines. Research limitations/implications: The research furthers the understanding of the development of supplier absorptive capacity for sustainability via SSD projects, including how it is triggered and sustained. The impact of ostensive and performative aspects of boundary objects on knowledge transfer is presented. Finally, insight is provided into how absorptive capacity and dynamic capabilities are linked in the context of SSD. Practical implications: Buying firms should seek to develop boundary objects that can trigger and maintain learning momentum for sustainability at supplier organisations in addition to effectively transferring SSD-related sustainability knowledge. There is also a need to allow for sufficient flexibility in the design of the boundary objects, and to pay sufficient attention to how suppliers contextualise and embed them into their own organisations, providing support for this process where necessary. For the supplier, establishing structures and routines for OHS management can help to prepare for future audits, thereby reducing audit fatigue. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the supply chain learning literature by exploring the development of supplier absorptive capacity for sustainability triggered by the focal buying firm.

Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: To understand the context surrounding the sustainable supplier management (SSM) process (i.e. selection, development and evaluation), this paper aims to explore institutional logics existing in the Ecuadorian cocoa supply chain (SC). By considering local characteristics and sustainability practices, this study illustrates how competing logic influences SSM. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a multiple-case study method for which the authors interviewed different cocoa SC members in Ecuador and used a ground-up approach to analyse the data and reveal singularities influencing sustainability management. Findings: The analysis uncovered two main logics operating within the Ecuadorian cocoa SC SSM process: a commercial logic (e.g. potential for market access, product traceability) and a sustainability logic (e.g. local development and traditions/cultural issues). These logics address market demand requirements; however, some local producers’ needs that impact SSM remains unexplored such as the existence of a regional ancestral culture that poses sustainability as a dominant logic with meaning beyond the triple bottom line. While the two logics have influenced supplier sustainability performance, this paper finds that, of the three SSM sub-processes (selection, development and evaluation), supplier development was the most relevant sub-process receiving attention from SC managers in the studied context. Practical implications: By understanding the differences in logic and needs, SC managers can better develop strategies for SSM. Originality/value: The study highlighted in this paper investigated the underexplored topic of the effects that competing logic may have on SSM.

Accordingly, varieties of paramount practices, i.e. Lean, Agile, Resilient and Green practices, are integrated in present study with the objective to develop a Decision Support Framework (DSF) to select robust supplier under the extent of Lean-Agile-Resilient-Green (LARG) practices for a manufacturing firm. The framework is developed and validated in the Indian automotive sector, where the primary data is collected based on perceptions of the respondents working in an automotive company. Design/methodology/approach: LARG metrics can ponder ecological balance, customer satisfaction, associations, effectiveness and sustainability and thus, the study consolidated LARG practices in one umbrella to develop a DSF. The analytical approach under DSF is developed by the integration AHP, DEMATEL, ANP, Extended MOORA and SAW techniques in present study to evaluate a robust supplier under the aegis of LARG practices in SC. DSF is developed by scrutinizing and categorizing LARG characteristics, where the selected LARG characteristics are handled by fuzzy sets theory to deal with the impreciseness and uncertainty in decision making. Findings: The study has identified 63 measures (15 for Lean, 15 for Agile, 14 for resilient and 19 for Green) to support the robust supplier selection process for manufacturing firms. The findings of study explicate “Internal communication agility”, “Interchangeability to personnel resources”, “Manufacturing flexibility”, “degree of online solution”, “Quickness to resource up-gradation”, “Manageability to demand and supply change”, “Overstocking inventory practices” as significant metrics in ranking order. Additionally, “Transparency to share information”, “Internal communication agility”, “Manufacturing Flexibility”, “Green product (outgoing)” are found as influential metrics under LARG practices respectively. Practical implications: A technical DSF to utilize by the managers is developed, which is connected with knowledge-based theory and a case of an automobile manufacturing firm is presented to illustrate its implementation. The companies can utilize presented DSF to impose service excellence, societal performance, agility and green surroundings in SC for achieving sustainable outcomes to be welcomed by the legislations, society and rivals. The framework represents an important decision support tool to enable managers to overcome imprecise SC information sources. Originality/value: The study presented a proficient platform to review the most significant LARG alternative in the SC. The study suggested a cluster of LARG metrics to support operational improvement in manufacturing firms for shifting gear toward sustainable SC practices. The present study embraces its existence in enrolling a high extent of collaboration amongst clients, project teams and LARG practices to virtually eradicate the likelihood of absolute project failure.","Sahu A.K., Sharma M., Raut R.D., Sahu A.K., Sahu N.K., Antony J., Tortorella G.L.",Decision-making framework for supplier selection using an integrated MCDM approach in a lean-agile-resilient-green environment: evidence from Indian automotive sector,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130916735&doi=10.1108%2fTQM-12-2021-0372&partnerID=40&md5=d8834e29a1ba2a3f914f950de93491f9
Benchmarking,"Purpose: Traceability of food is of paramount importance to the increasingly sustainability-conscious consumers. Several tracking and tracing systems have been developed in the AgriFood sector in order to prove to the consumers the origins and processing of food products. Critical challenges in realizing food's traceability include cooperating with multiple actors on common data sharing standards and data models. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a design science approach to showcase traceability that includes preharvest activities and conditions in a case study. The authors demonstrate how existing data sharing standards can be applied in combination with new data models suitable for capturing transparency information about plant production. Findings: Together with existing studies on farm-to-fork transparency, our results demonstrate how to realize transparency from field to fork and enable producers to show a complete bill of sustainability. Originality/value: The existing standards and data models address transparency challenges in AgriFood chains from the moment of harvest up to retail (farm-to-fork) relatively well, but not what happens before harvest. In order to address sustainability concerns, there is a need to collect data about production activities related to product quality and sustainability before harvesting and share it downstream the supply chain. The ability to gather data on sustainability practices such as reducing pesticide, herbicide, fertilizer and water use are crucial requirements for producers to market their produce as quality and sustainable products.","Moysiadis T., Spanaki K., Kassahun A., Kläser S., Becker N., Alexiou G., Zotos N., Karali I.",AgriFood supply chain traceability: data sharing in a farm-to-fork case,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135435643&doi=10.1108%2fBIJ-01-2022-0006&partnerID=40&md5=5a2348013e70fd13a98ee606e2a3b712
Journal of Modelling in Management,"Purpose: Visibility management is essential to sustainable supply chains (SSCs), allowing the ability to see the chain end-to-end, with opportunities to derive benefits, including competitive advantage. Central to visibility management is visibility assessment and identification of areas for improvement. This paper aims to propose a method of assessing visibility in SSCs and the generation of proposals for improvement. Design/methodology/approach: A hierarchically structured assessment template is developed that comprises of dimensions, factors and attributes of visibility in SSCs. The template permits the use of linguistic variables. A fuzzy logic approach is adopted to calculate visibility levels and generate improvement areas based on linguistic data captured through the template. An industry-based case study is used to illustrate the process. Findings: This study reveals that visibility can be measured straightforwardly using the method developed in this paper. It is found that automation and contextual factors can significantly impact visibility levels, so also is sustainability awareness and practices adopted.

Smart and Sustainable Built Environment,"Purpose: While circular economy (CE) is fast becoming a political and economic agenda for global urban development, there are still substantial knowledge gaps in possible strategies to speed up such transition, especially in the construction industry. This study analyses literature surrounding CE to unpack current trends possible future research directions to foster CE implementation in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study undertakes a systematic review of CE literature published between 1990 and 2019. It adopts a five-stage procedure as a methodological approach for the review: formulation of the research question(s), locating and identifying relevant studies, selection and evaluation of studies, analysis or synthesis and results reporting. Findings: The findings on CE research in the construction industry show extensive focus on resource use and waste management. There are limited investigations in other areas of construction such as supply chain integration, building designs, policy, energy efficiency, land use, offsite manufacturing, whole life costing, and risk, cost reduction, cost management, health and safety management. The study findings provide evidence that current CE practice fails to incorporate other areas that would facilitate the network of true circular construction industry. Originality/value: This research provides a comprehensive overview of research efforts on CE in the construction context, identifying areas of extensive and limited coverage over three decades.

Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: While it is known that digital transformation facilitates data flow in supply chains, its importance on green supply chain management (GSCM) has not been investigated concisely. This paper aims to expand the theory of digital transformation in GSCM by investigating the interconnections between these concepts and providing an integrative view of a smart green supply chain management (Smart GSCM). Design/methodology/approach: This adopts a configurational perspective on digital transformation and supply chain management (SCM) to investigate the different dimensions of Smart GSCM and their contribution to green performance. Therefore, this paper analyzes data from 473 manufacturing companies using regression techniques. Findings: The results show how smart supply chain contributes to green performance through managing green relationships (external GSCM activities) and establishing green operations (internal GSCM activities). Furthermore, this paper finds partial mediating effects for external and internal GSCM activities on green performance. These findings show that smart supply chain (i.e. digital transformation strategy and front-end technologies, supported by several back-end technologies) is directly associated with higher levels of GSCM. It is specifically associated with one of the internal dimensions of green operations, namely, green purchasing activities. Hence, the findings suggest that digital transformation alone is insufficient to achieve green performance, needing a GSCM configuration to mediate this effect. Practical implications: This study calls attention to how managers should integrate these at least three different perspectives of SCM: digital transformation, external relationships and internal operations to increase green performance. Originality/value: As the main contribution, this study provides a configurational and holistic understanding of the different dimensions and mechanisms in Smart GSCM.","Lerman L.V., Benitez G.B., Müller J.M., de Sousa P.R., Frank A.G.",Smart green supply chain management: a configurational approach to enhance green performance through digital transformation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136873076&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-02-2022-0059&partnerID=40&md5=ec7b2df7302f5cae712a6fa6d70df37f
International Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Purpose: While localized small-series production is a significant opportunity, various tensions challenge implementation in high-cost contexts. This paper explores how managers view and respond to different tensions in small-series production implementation by adopting a paradox-based perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a multiple case study addressing small-series production within EU's apparel industry, as key context to address managerial awareness, and responses to tensions regarding location and supply network configuration decisions. Seven cases were selected for variation in customization and implementation (early/established), ownership, location and company size, to identity commonalities. Findings: The study highlights performing tensions related to sustainability, and risk, in addition to confirming traditional goal-related tensions predominantly impacting small volume production. With on-demand/custom production, tensions include costs in conflict with process scale, and several process-related tensions (flexibility, expansion/development, risk management). Identified multidimensional responses do not include location or structural decisions, instead focusing on synthesis, through product-operations efficiency, knowledge development and process innovation and supply chain collaboration. Temporal separation is found with customization, including reducing product/process complexity short-term with enhancing process development, which suggests latent learning tensions and limited awareness. Research limitations/implications: Future research should address the extent to which tensions can be resolved or remain paradoxical, as well as dynamic decision-making and latent tensions. Originality/value: The paper shows how paradox theory facilitates a deeper understanding of complex network configuration decisions, including reshoring/localization.

International Journal of Logistics Management,"Purpose: While the literature on multitier supply chain management traditionally assumes that first-tier suppliers belong to the visible proportion of the supply base, intermediaries might limit focal firms' visible horizon already at this stage. High power asymmetries promoting centrality and complexity in the supply network are seen as a particular root cause that limits the impact of governance mechanisms for sustainability. To map the space for governance mechanisms in a network-sensitive context more comprehensively, the study analyzes supply network characteristics from a power perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This research is conceptual. To better understand power imbalances and mutual dependencies from network centrality and complexity, network configurations were constructed drawing on resource dependence theory. These configurations allow deducing the impact of (non-)mediated governance mechanisms for a sustainable development in the supply network. An agenda to stimulate future empirical and model-based research is accordingly presented. Findings: The research shows that those networks with densely interconnected first-tier suppliers promote network centrality and complexity, leading to an inverted U-shape relationship between the focal firm's exertion of coercive power and the sustainability performance in the supply network. The findings allow a more comprehensive theoretical grounding for mapping governance approaches in a network-sensitive context and provide insights on how to avoid negative effects from power asymmetries. Practical implications: The findings suggest the need for accompanying, indirect governance mechanisms already at the stage of first-tier suppliers based on non-mediated forms of power, such as referent power, also promoting disintermediation. Purchasing companies may also consider using digital platform technologies that foster disintermediation, such as blockchain technology. Originality/value: By studying intermediaries from a power and network perspective, the conceptualization adds to the discussion on governance in multitier sustainable supply chain networks in various industries. Furthermore, it contributes to the increasing efforts of middle-range theorizing in logistics and supply chain management.

Supply Chain Management,"Purpose: While various aspects of the vegetable supply chain (SC) have been increasingly studied, most studies tend to investigate the downstream part of the SC in terms of customer demand and product quality. Relatively fewer studies have focused on upstream suppliers/farmers. This study aims to understand upstream farmers’ positions in different types of vegetable SCs and identify ways of enhancing sustainable vegetable SC collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on an in-depth case study of a cooperative SC in Vietnam from the perspectives of both the cooperative and its farmers. Findings: The study found that cooperative SCs are the most appropriate for Vietnamese farmers. It also identified the key activities needed to engage farmers with cooperative SCs and the mechanisms that the cooperative needs to develop. Cooperative SCs can be enhanced only when farmers are motivated to engage in SC activities and when the cooperative implements a robust management mechanism.

International Journal of Operations and Production Management,"Purpose: While various supply chain (SC) sustainability investigations exist, their connection to supply chain resilience (SCRes) remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, the authors answer the question: “How do firms' sustainability actions affect their SCs' resilience and sustainability trajectories in turbulent environments?"" by exploring the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted 10 case studies in five industries located in six European countries. A total of 19 semi-structured interviews and relevant secondary data were collected and analyzed in reference to SC sustainability learning and the literature on SCRes approaches (i.e. engineering, ecological and social-ecological). Findings: 31 SC actions referring to different sustainability dimensions were identified to map SCRes learning through a temporal, spatial and functional scale analysis. While five cases are related to an engineering approach focused on “bouncing back” to pre-pandemic goals, three cases were focused on “bouncing forward” as part of an ecological approach. Moreover, the authors identified the existence of two social-ecological resilience cases which developed long-term actions, updating functional set-ups transcending the SC level. The results furthermore illustrate an influence of the SCRes approaches on SC sustainability learning, generating three different paths: flat, flat ascending and ascending SC sustainability trajectories. Research limitations/implications: The study develops an overview of the adoption of SCRes approaches due to temporal, spatial and functional scales, and their effect on SC sustainability trajectories through exploitation and exploration capabilities. Future research should elaborate on potential moderators in the proposed relationships.

Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal,"Purpose: With increasing pressure from the government and private sectors to be more environmentally and socially responsible, sustainable supplier selection has gained enormous currency in recent times. Particularly, in the case of the construction industry, owing to a large amount of industrial wastage generated and extreme workplace conditions, it is even more important to devise strategies to mitigate the harmful consequences. The most crucial step in this regard is the selection of sustainable suppliers that acquire a pivotal position in the supply chain ecosystem. This study aims to identify indicators for three criteria such as economic, environmental and social, and prioritize them according to their level of significance for sustainable supplier selection in the Indian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the best-worst method (BWM) is presented for sustainable supplier selection in Indian construction organizations. Total of 27 indicators was identified for the three criteria of the triple bottom line (TBL) approach namely economic, environmental and social. Using BWM, the most important criterion was found and subsequently, all the indicators under each criterion were ranked in order of importance. Findings: The analysis revealed that the environmental criterion was the most important criteria in the sustainable supplier selection followed by the economic criteria. The indicators that were the most influential in the effective selection process were “Usage of recyclable raw materials for production”, “Adoption of clean and green technologies”, “Waste management” and “Periodical environmental audits” under the environmental criteria; “Efficiency”, “Cost” and “Flexibility and Scalability” from the economic criteria; and “Safety programs” and “Information disclosure” in the social criteria. Research limitations/implications: The study provides a reference framework for the selection of sustainable suppliers in construction organizations.

Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal,"Purpose: With the rapid change that has taken place with digitalization and data-driven approaches in supply chains, business environment become more competitive and reaching sustainability in supply chains become even more challenging. In order to manage supply chains properly, in terms of considering environmental, social and economic impacts, organizations need to deal with huge amount of data and improve organizations' data management skills. From this view, increased number of stakeholders and dynamic environment reveal the importance of data-driven technologies in sustainable supply chains.

Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Quantifying the emissions produced along different supply chains is an extremely difficult challenge. However, carbon-based emissions generated by the transport sector have an extremely significant impact on environmental sustainability. To address these issues, we propose a method for estimating the carbon footprint as an indicator of the environmental sustainability of processes as it represents the total emissions produced within a given process. Therefore, the first problem we come across is developing a tool for calculating the logistic carbon footprint, which clearly defines the boundaries of application of the model and its scope of application. For this reason, the proposed tool will follow a standardized and uniform approach in order to streamline the calculation processes and make it even more efficient: the sources of emissions related to a supply chain are innumerable, so depending on the different approaches to calculating emissions, they can lead to extremely different results. In order to streamline the calculation process, the main sources of primary emissions and indirect emissions due to the supply of fuel oil have been used in a preponderant manner, and then an adjustment factor that takes into account all factors omitted from the model has been introduced. In this way, the calculation of the carbon footprint has been made uniform, homogeneous, and comparable as well as quantitatively reliable. Once the method of elaboration of the carbon footprint is framed, we will proceed to use this synthetic indicator for the analysis of environmental sustainability for different logistic processes that consider the Port of Trieste as an intermodal exchange hub for intra-Mediterranean traffic and with destination the main markets of continental Europe, taking into account different modes of transport: road, rail, and maritime transport.",Gallo A.,The Logistic Carbon Footprint: A Dynamic Calculation Tool for an Indicator of the Sustainability of Logistic Processes with a Case Study on the Port of Trieste,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135897387&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-10548-7_9&partnerID=40&md5=1c14d0b3f51e7515d4bba898278608cd
Business Strategy and the Environment,"Rapid and dynamic changes in environment, technologies, consumer behavior, policy making, and climate are putting extra pressure to food supply chain, especially in terms of efficiently manage food security, food surplus, food loss, and waste. These changes directly affect food supply chain negatively. Thus, transition into more circular approach for green business growth in food supply chains is a necessity. One way to reduce this negativity is to ensure the share of information along the chain. With this context, sharing information and knowledge among the food supply chain can facilitate practices from a circularity and green perspectives. Hence, this research focuses on understanding and revealing knowledge-sharing networks challenges, barriers, and benefits across every food supply chain layer, presenting tangible contributions to improve traceability in circularity perspectives with refuse, rethink, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, and recover challenges. Therefore, and to provide a green business growth, this study examines the practice of knowledge sharing among real-life industry food stakeholders in the meat sector regarding their dimensions, what type of knowledge is shared and whether there are differences among specific groups of food stakeholders for the knowledge sharing.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Rapid economic growth and industrialization have brought material abundance and convenience, but also social and environmental problems such as global warming, climate change, and ozone depletion. For this reason, the public and governments have continued to make efforts to reduce carbon oxide emissions worldwide over the past few decades. To achieve this mission, cap-and-trade regulations have been introduced as one of the most effective market-based mechanisms to control carbon emissions. Accordingly, sustainability efforts, including the development of green products and innovating manufacturing technologies, are being made by companies in supply chains to reduce their carbon emissions. In the context of sustainability innovations and carbon emission constraints, this article investigates pricing decisions, the degree of sustainability efforts, and carbon caps under two different supply chain contracts—in this case, wholesale price contract and cost-sharing contract. This article establishes a Stackelberg game model under each of the supply chain contract types and presents the equilibrium decisions made by players of the game. Major findings of this article reveal that (i) the performance of the supply chain is considerably affected by the presence of a carbon cap; (ii) the higher the carbon cap set by a government is, the more sustainability innovation efforts the supply chain makes; and (iii) the supply chain can improve its profitability and its sustainability under a cost-sharing contract.","Lee D.-H., Yoon J.-C.","Decisions on Pricing, Sustainability Effort, and Carbon Cap under Wholesale Price and Cost-Sharing Contracts",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129192813&doi=10.3390%2fsu14084863&partnerID=40&md5=85afc7fa528aa169a44fe769c13b8ea7
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Rapid industrialization and the increased use of consumer electronic goods have increased the demand for energy. To meet the increasing energy demand, global nations are looking for energy from renewable sources rather than non-renewable sources, to adhere with the sustainability principle. As energy from renewable sources is still in the experimental stage, there is a need to use available energy sources optimally. Considering this, the present study aims to identify, evaluate, and reveal the interrelationship among critical challenge factors in improving the heat rate performance of coal-fired thermal power plants. The study identifies twenty critical challenges through a comprehensive literature review. Then, to evaluate the identified critical challenges, the grey-DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) technique is used. For evaluating the challenges, this study conducts an empirical analysis in a thermal power plant in India. The findings reveal that air preheater leakage, coal flow balancing, and air heater air outlet temperature are the top three critical challenges hampering the thermal power plant’s performance. Additionally, fourteen challenges come under the cause group, while eight challenges come under the effect group.

Procedia CIRP,"Realization of a Circular Economy is paramount to solving global challenges in resource scarcity, sustainable manufacturing, and supply chain uncertainty. A Circular Economy (CE) is an economic system hallmarked by linearity reduction, decoupling of economic growth and resource depletion, and favoring regenerative models that consider sustainability. Growing support for a CE is leading to the proliferation of new economic terms, standards, and research to meet the different goals of CE. However, gaps exist in the formalization of these CE terms, frameworks, and research contributions. This paper provides a system-level context for a CE from the perspective of manufacturing in the product life cycle. We do this using the standard process modeling representation IDEFO. The main contribution of this work is to provide the general context for a CE system by examining each CE activity involved in the creation of a product, reviewing the current literature, identifying current CE standards status and directions, and discussing CE concepts present in current business practices. This work will act as a reference for identifying gaps in research and standards development for integration of CE in manufacturing practices. Through this work, we identified two opportunities for furthering CE progress: metrics for measuring CE success and a standard CE framework with term definitions.","Reslan M., Last N., Mathur N., Morris K.C., Ferrero V.",Circular Economy: A Product Life Cycle Perspective on Engineering and Manufacturing Practices,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127521748&doi=10.1016%2fj.procir.2022.02.141&partnerID=40&md5=93dc83334cc1de8a82cf8365cb31a26a
Chemical Engineering Research and Design,"Reasons such as volatile fossil fuel prices, environmental limitations, and swift economic growth have increased the demand for clean renewable energy. Bioenergy has been received much attention from researchers due to its various benefits compared to other renewable energy alternatives. In this paper, a three-stage approach is developed to design a sustainable sugarcane-based bioenergy supply chain network under an uncertain environment. The fuzzy data envelopment analysis method is employed in the first stage to determine the appropriate regions for opening the sugarcane fields according to climatic, ecological, and social criteria. The nominated regions are then integrated into a mathematical optimization model as candidate locations for sugarcane fields to configure the proposed supply chain design. This stage helps reduce the computational complexity and provides a reasonable solution by excluding the inappropriate regions. In the second stage, a robust mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) is formulated to optimize a set of strategic and tactical decision variables. The enviromental impacts from CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2-eq emissions), water, and energy consumption in all echelons of the supply chain are incorporated in the developed model. This model is capable of providing a steady design against different expected scenarios. In the last stage, an experimental analysis is conducted, to examine the performance of the developed model in comparison with an expected scenario model. A real case study in Iraq is applied to check the applicability of the developed model. The results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed robust model over the expected scenario model in terms of the mean and standard deviation of their objective functions by 18% and 51% respectively.","Abdali H., Sahebi H., Pishvaee M.",A sustainable robust optimization model to design a sugarcane-based bioenergy supply network: A case study,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125603214&doi=10.1016%2fj.cherd.2022.02.028&partnerID=40&md5=59a6fdc399193af4a4c56a7f154baa01
International Journal of Information Management Data Insights,"Recent advancements and developments in artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches have shifted the manufacturing practices towards the fourth industrial revolution, considered as Industry 4.0 practices. A positive impact of AI-based techniques on sustainability can be seen in manufacturing organisations’ at the system, product and process levels. Adopting AI-based strategies in manufacturing improves decision making, productivity and system performance. Despite sustainability and other benefits, the adoption of AI-based approaches in manufacturing organisations is still limited due to employees’ knowledge and digital skills. In the present time, due to the digitalisation of manufacturing activities, intelligent sensors, and supply chain activities, industries are facing challenges with the generation of high volume, different variety and velocity of data. This data can be helpful for manufacturing organisations to enhance their performance and sustainability. However, managing this big data is still a significant challenge due to a lack of knowledge and limited literature. Deep learning (DL) based models can be a suitable choice to provide advanced analytics tools for manufacturing data processing and analysis. However, literature on the DL is still limited in the manufacturing context with its relationship to sustainability. The present study discusses the evolution of DL approaches in manufacturing and different DL-based models. This study also highlights how DL-based approaches can enhance the sustainability performance of industries. In the study, primary research areas, i.e., fault diagnosis, quality management, and predictive maintenance, have been discussed. Finally, a conceptual DL-based framework is proposed for the manufacturing industries to enhance their sustainability performance in manufacturing activities.","Jamwal A., Agrawal R., Sharma M.","Deep learning for manufacturing sustainability: Models, applications in Industry 4.0 and implications",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135916650&doi=10.1016%2fj.jjimei.2022.100107&partnerID=40&md5=0763887a95c937c6bfc8cb66e87df4c2
Knowledge-Based Systems,"Recent global changes have prompted manufacturers to shift their production systems to make-to-order (MTO) supply chain (SC), enabling them to adapt customised customer requirements with their rapidly changing behaviours, reduce inventory costs, and obtain competitive advantages in the market. However, traditional MTO-based scheduling approaches fail to consider all the SC stages required for optimal schedules. This study proposes an integrated SC scheduling problem (ISCSP), where supplier, manufacturer and batching decisions are simultaneously optimised in response to heterogeneous customer requirements with time window constraints. Both economic and environmental sustainability for the supply portfolio is considered while the manufacturer is modelled using the flexible job shop scheduling (FJS) problem. Since the proposed ISCSP is an extension of the FJS problem, this can also be considered an NP-hard problem, which cannot be solved by traditional optimisation techniques, particularly for larger instances. Thus, a self-adaptive multi-operator and multi-objective hyper-heuristic (SA(MO)2H) is designed, where the low-level heuristic utilises strengths of four solution updating heuristics and is intelligently guided by the reinforcement learning, to address the problem. The proposed SA(MO)2H integrates environmental sustainability into the evolutionary process to achieve the best possible supply portfolio, adopting the VIKORSORT approach. Finally, a rigorous experimental study on solving a wide range of instances is conducted to evaluate the performance of SA(MO)2H against its non-intelligent versions and five existing algorithms. Overall, the most beneficial facet of the developed ISCSP and SA(MO)2H is the visibility and meaningful managerial insights provided by the multi-portfolio solutions fostering the responsive relationship among SC stages.","Mahmud S., Abbasi A., Chakrabortty R.K., Ryan M.J.",A self-adaptive hyper-heuristic based multi-objective optimisation approach for integrated supply chain scheduling problems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132572681&doi=10.1016%2fj.knosys.2022.109190&partnerID=40&md5=05d474e0161a775d9afab665f1feef56
Agriculture and Human Values,"Recent literature demonstrates the contribution of short food supply chains (SFSC) to regional economies and sustainable food systems, and acknowledges their role as drivers for sustainable development. Moreover, different types of SFSC have been supported by urban food policies (UFP) over the few last years and actors from the food chain became part of new institutional settings for urban food policies. However, evidence from the sustainability impact assessment (SIA) of these SFSC in urban contexts is limited. Our paper presents an approach for the development of an SIA framework for different SFSC types. In addition, a practical application of the tool in four metropolitan regions (Berlin, London, Ljubljana and Nairobi) is tested. The conceptual development of the SIA framework is based on an in-depth analysis of existing SIA frameworks and methods for assessing the sustainability of agriculture, food chains and food systems and adapted to the specific needs of analysing SFSC in metropolitan regions. The operational value and utility of the framework and the tool were tested with social and natural scientists and local stakeholders. The assessment results demonstrate that SFSC seems to be more sustainable than the baseline (long global food chains) in the social dimension, but also feature specific strengths and weaknesses concerning their economic and environmental sustainability. This might give an indication for regional adjusted strategies and food chain innovations that improve the sustainability performance may be required. We found the tool useful for framing the dialogue between food chain actors, consumers and policy, because it makes benefits and trade-offs of the chain types operating in an urban–rural context more visible and communicable.","Doernberg A., Piorr A., Zasada I., Wascher D., Schmutz U.",Sustainability assessment of short food supply chains (SFSC): developing and testing a rapid assessment tool in one African and three European city regions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125133914&doi=10.1007%2fs10460-021-10288-w&partnerID=40&md5=370e0edb68348f66e7bb64da134e2938
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Recent progress in IoT and software development has simplified data acquisition and immutability of information in the agri-food supply chain. In the last few years, several frameworks and applications were proposed to ensure traceability in the agri-food-sector using distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as Blockchain technologies. Still, no other study has presented a Blockchain-based traceability platform with a lower impact on the environment and lower cost for each transaction sent by the supply chain. This article presents a traceability platform based on Green Blockchain with low energy consumption and costs savings applied to the Fontina PDO cheese supply chain, part of the project “Typicalp”, funded by the European Union (EU). The proposed traceability system is based on Algorand Blockchain, which uses the Pure Proof-of-Stake mechanism of consensus that requires minimal computational power, is highly scalable and environmentally sustainable. In addition to the environmental and financial benefits, the developed traceability platform has made it possible to digitize the entire production chain, making the data immutable and available in real-time for Fontina consortium operators and final consumers.","Varavallo G., Caragnano G., Bertone F., Vernetti-Prot L., Terzo O.",Traceability Platform Based on Green Blockchain: An Application Case Study in Dairy Supply Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126295526&doi=10.3390%2fsu14063321&partnerID=40&md5=5cfeb70e7b8f2b18c01aefa19c282472
Supply Chain Forum,"Recent studies have highlighted the potential of supply chain visibility (SCV) to improve companies’ performance, support the decision-making process and increase the resilience and sustainability of supply chains (SC). However, the definition and the approaches to manage visibility are not consensual, especially when it comes to its assessment. This paper studies the influence that some characteristics of the information shared among SC partners have on SCV and provides a model that allows to assess the level of visibility. Focus group research was used to discuss the visibility assessment model with academic and practical experts and case studies were conducted to evaluate the implementation of the model in real contexts. The results support the applicability of the model in complex SCs and show that the visibility indices proposed can help managers to identify the SC partners where improvement actions are needed. This study contributes to literature and practice by means of a model to assess the visibility throughout the SC by considering different types and characteristics of the information shared.","Messina D., Soares A.L., Barros A.C., Zimmermann R.",How visible is your supply chain?

Remote Sensing,"Recently, soybean production almost doubled in Brazil, reaching 122 million tonnes, and it is expected to increase even more. Brazil is the world’s largest producer and is primarily an exporter. From a sustainability point of view, soy production has been strongly criticized mainly in relation to deforestation, albeit for indirect effects. Soybean oil is a potential feedstock for the production of bio-jet fuels, which needs to be sustainable according to international criteria (sustainable aviation fuels—SAF). This paper aims to estimate the areas still available for soy expansion in Brazil, considering conditions that would allow the production of SAF. We used the SAFmaps platform, a geospatial database with information on the most promising bioenergy crops for SAF and their supply chains. Just by displacing pastures and observing a set of constraints, the total area available for expansion was estimated at 192.8 thousand km2, of which 43% is of high suitability. These areas are concentrated in the Center-West region. Assuming a vertical supply chain, the results of the case studies of SAF production indicate potential feasibility, but some hypotheses considered are optimistic. Moreover, the results indicate that there can be sustainable production of soybean oil and contribution to the production of SAF.","Guarenghi M.M., Walter A., Seabra J.E.A., Rocha J.V., Vieira N., Damame D., Santos J.L.",Areas Available for the Potential Sustainable Expansion of Soy in Brazil: A Geospatial Assessment Using the SAFmaps Database,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127874489&doi=10.3390%2frs14071628&partnerID=40&md5=846659c3237429c478b60b44653edf6e
Environmental and Sustainability Indicators,"Recently, the Circular Economy paradigm has emerged as an alternative to linear and unsustainable production and consumption systems. However, no established indicator exists to assist the transition of supply chains to a higher degree of circularity; also, most of the literature on Circular Economy indicators has focused on the firm rather than on the supply chain as the level of analysis. Through a Systematic Literature Review, this paper examines decision support tools, and related indicators, employed for assessing the performance of Circular Supply Chains in the academic literature. In parallel, a content analysis and a template technique are employed to evaluate how Multi National Enterprises measure the effect of the adoption of Circular Economy practices in their reports. Results are synthesised in two composite indicators, which aggregate the most commonly employed metrics. Findings show that both academic literature and industrial practice show a scarce consideration of social and circularity measurements, rather focusing on classical environmental impacts and economic ones. In the academic literature, the economic dimension is prevalent; practitioners seem to evaluate and communicate more often the environmental impacts of already adopted Circular Economy practices. This article also recognises the different and sometimes hidden worldview assumptions in current Circular Economy indicators, highlighting that different paths toward Circular Supply Chains are possible depending on value and methodological choices. Future contributions should explicetly state these assumptions and their idea of a Circular Economy.","Calzolari T., Genovese A., Brint A.",Circular Economy indicators for supply chains: A systematic literature review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121651354&doi=10.1016%2fj.indic.2021.100160&partnerID=40&md5=e8a889e8e8480e597ec2b27a80a0ab1f
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Recently, the concept of circular supply chain has gained huge popularity as a suitable means to accomplish efficient resource utilization for ultimate supply chain sustainability. However, studies are scarce that provide insight on how manufacturing firms particularly in emerging countries like Nigeria can facilitate circular supply chain implementation for expected performance gains. To fill this gap, this study proposes a robust methodology based on Best- Worst-Method (BWM) and Evaluation Based on Distance to Average Solution (EDAS) to investigate the enablers of circular supply chain decisions in the Nigerian manufacturing sector. The current study is a pioneering effort in the extant literature on the utilization of BWM-EDAS in the study of circular supply chain implementation especially in the manufacturing sector from the managers' perspectives in an emerging economy- Nigeria. The findings indicate that supplier relationship development, periodic environmental audits and positive consumer attitude are the most critical enablers of implementing circular supply chain in the manufacturing industry. Furthermore, the study results highlight the low relative importance of manufacturing firms’ financial strength during the adoption of circular economy strategies in their supply chains, thereby suggesting that circular supply chains can be implemented in financially constrained firms. Hence, this study presents relevant constructs that serve as guidelines to managers and policy makers on circular supply chain implementation in manufacturing firms and thereby enriches literature on the circularity concept.","Orji I.J., U-Dominic C.M., Okwara U.K.",Exploring the determinants in circular supply chain implementation in the Nigerian manufacturing industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120461393&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2021.11.023&partnerID=40&md5=940b08f16fe2a3ea3fa6ed5cff066ee1
Waste Management,"Recently, the novel concept of the circular supply chain (CSC) has gained substantial attention amongst researchers across the globe. It is due to the issues of unsustainability in supply chain operation of manufacturing industry. CSC amalgamates the circular economy (CE) into the supply chain of manufacturing organizations. Business organizations can achieve several sustainable development goals by adopting CSC as an innovative strategy. However, limited attention has been given to its implementation in emerging economies. Thus, this research aim is to identify and analyze the essential CE practices that help to accomplish the several sustainable development goals (SDGs) of CSC management. This research presents an integrated framework of Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (PF-AHP) and Pythagorean fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment (PF-CODAS) techniques. PF-AHP is employed to determine the relative importance of CE practices, whereas PF-CODAS method ranks the SDGs derived due to the adoption of CE practices. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated with the help of an Indian manufacturing organization. The finding of this research reveals that practices based on 'government', 'management', and 'economy' initiatives play a significant role and contribute 50 % of its influence on the effective CSC adoption, whereas, 'mitigate waste and enhance environmental sustainability', is identified as the most critical SDG realized due to adoption of CE practices. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to check the robustness of proposed methods. This research provides the systematic, accurate, and valuable decision support tools to practitioners to execute the CE practices efficiently for achieving the various sustainability goals.","Lahane S., Kant R.",Investigating the sustainable development goals derived due to adoption of circular economy practices,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124990580&doi=10.1016%2fj.wasman.2022.02.016&partnerID=40&md5=5e9e3c736fee555080e721000a0f93d5
International Journal of Fuzzy Systems,"Recently, the soft drink industry has been confronted with a rapidly changing business climate and increased competition, creating risks and uncertainties in its supply chain. Thus, immediate actions are required to handle these risks and uncertainties. The purpose of this paper is to identify and classify these risks in the soft drink supply chain and to develop a methodology comprising a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of these risks. FAHP was used to determine the weights of five major risk categories and 23 sub risks under these major categories. Afterward, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method (FCEM) was applied for the assessment of overall risk level, risk levels of the five major categories and relative risk levels of the 23 sub risks. This research has been conducted focusing on the soft drink industry of Bangladesh, a developing country with an emerging economy. In the existing literature, this work contributes by identifying and evaluating risks in the soft drink supply chain in the context of Bangladesh. The outcome of this study indicates that the overall risk level in the supply chain of the soft drink industry is between low and medium, and the risk level of the demand risks is the highest whereas the risk level of infrastructural risks is the lowest.

If deployed at scale, the demand for ammonia from the shipping industry would be immense such that significant new investments had to be made in green ammonia infrastructure, including entire supply chains of new production sites and ammonia refueling ports. In this work, we develop an optimization model for the design of such a green ammonia supply chain. The proposed model integrates a large set of decisions, including the location of production plants and refueling ports, operational decisions related to green ammonia production using renewable energy, and ship routing decisions.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Recycling subsidy and carbon tax policies are ways to achieve energy and environmental sustainability. The implementation of these policies has changed the operating environment of traditional closed-loop supply chains, while the privacy of relevant information increases the difficulty of decision-making. Under the background, this paper considers the green closed-loop supply chain (GCLSC) under the hybrid policy of recycling subsidy and carbon tax where the manufacturer is in charge of recycling and the retailer invests in green marketing. Taking green marketing cost coefficient as the retailer’s private information, this paper explores the influence of information asymmetry on optimal decisions and performance of the GCLSC. By constructing game models of information symmetry and asymmetry, the optimal decisions, economic and environmental performance, and social welfare are provided. Combined with numerical analysis, the influence of uncertainty of the manufacturer’s estimation, subsidies and carbon tax on the GCLSC is proposed. The results indicate that the uncertainty in the manufacturer’s estimation can improve the social welfare under certain conditions, but it cannot reduce carbon emissions. Recycling subsidy and carbon tax policies oppositely affect the manufacturer’s optimal decisions and carbon emissions. Information asymmetry is beneficial to the retailer. However, less uncertainty in estimation is not always better for the manufacturer. The manufacturer needs to proactively adopt strategies to stimulate the retailer’s information sharing.","Xu J., Wang P., Xu Q.",Impact of Information Asymmetry on the Operation of Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain under Government Regulation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133528578&doi=10.3390%2fsu14137999&partnerID=40&md5=c55e6b535596b7282971f015914862f2
Communications Earth and Environment,"Reducing food loss and waste can improve the efficiency of food supply chains and provide food security. Here we estimate mass flow as well as food loss and waste along the US food supply chain for 10 commodity groups and nine management pathways to provide a baseline for designing efficient strategies to reduce, recycle, and recover food loss and waste. We estimate a total food loss and waste of 335.4 million metric tonnes from the U.S. food supply chain in 2016. Water evaporation (19%), recycling (55%), and landfill, incineration, or wastewater treatment (23%) accounted for most of the loss and waste. The consumption stage accounted for 57% of the food loss and waste disposed of through landfill, incineration, or wastewater treatment. Manufacturing was the largest contributor to food loss and waste (61%) but had a high recycling rate. High demand, perishable products accounted for 67% of food waste.

Proceedings of The 11th International Conference on Logistics and Systems Engineering,"Related social issues have become more prominent than before in terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental awareness. In this paper, three low-carbon logistics service supply chain models with logistics service integrator (LSI) and logistics service provider (LSP), including one centralized decision-making model, one decentralized decision-making model, and Sharpley Value profit distribution model, are designed to understand the influence of the degree of fulfilling CSR, CSR demand coefficient, low-carbon demand coefficient, and price demand coefficient on decision-making by comparing optimal solutions of these models. The results show that the greater the impact coefficient of CSR demand, the greater the value of profit and decision variables. On the contrary, the larger the price demand coefficient, the smaller the value of profit and decision variables. It is also found that the low-carbon demand coefficient has a more obvious impact on centralized decision-making. At the same time, when the low-carbon impact coefficient is smaller, each profit is less affected by it and the difference between profits is not large.

Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,"Remanufacture unlocks the residual values in used products by prolonging the life cycles, whereas the inherent uncertainty in reverse logistics presents a significant challenge for operations management and brings resources into waste. To reduce the negative externality caused by uncertainty in reverse logistics, this study makes stochastic analysis of the market uncertainty and formulates an ordering strategy for environmental sustainability to minimize the carbon emissions. Further, considering the externality of environmental pollution can be internalized into the operating cost by carbon trading mechanism, we then investigate the economic behavior under the fluctuation of carbon price. Through polynomial regression, the model forecasts the carbon price in Beijing carbon trading center and quantifies the impacts of price variation on the decision process, then from which devises a balanced and sustainable EOQ strategy to optimize the economic efficiency at lower resource input.

Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Remanufacturing and recycling of end-of-life products have changed the structure of supply chain networks, and the option of closed-loop supply chains gains popularity. Growing strict environmental and social legislations are expected to enhance sustainability of closed-loop supply chains. This study focuses on the pricing and advertising decisions in a closed-loop supply chain network. Although pricing decisions have been well-studied in this area, there is a little attention to advertising decisions. It is well-known that advertising plays a significant role in influencing customer behavior in returning end-of-life products for the closed-loop supply chain. Therefore, this research develops an operational and tactical plan for promoting advertising programs considering different elasticity effects. As such, the proposed optimization plan considers the pricing decisions in a more comprehensive view, where the price of similar products in the market and their substitution degree have a high impact on the profitability of manufacturers in a direct-sales closed-loop supply chain. Hence, the main novelty of this paper is to develop a new optimization model with pricing and advertising decisions in a direct-sales closed-loop supply chain. Since the proposed model is more complex than the majority of existing optimization models in the area of closed-loop supply chains, another novelty of this paper is to propose an improvement to the standard particle swarm optimization algorithm using the crowd-learning theory. The developed algorithm is validated by the exact solver and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in this research area. An extensive computational experiment is performed considering a number of comparative metrics. The findings show the superior performance of the proposed metaheuristic against the alternative solution approaches in terms of computational time and solution quality. Moreover, some important insights are obtained from this research, which could provide a basis for configuration of pricing schemes and advertising campaigns to improve the efficiency of closed-loop supply chains.","Asghari M., Afshari H., Mirzapour Al-e-hashem S.M.J., Fathollahi-Fard A.M., Dulebenets M.A.",Pricing and advertising decisions in a direct-sales closed-loop supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135714928&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2022.108439&partnerID=40&md5=83a1210d1155f3456dc69405fe5b2817
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Remanufacturing is a key element of circular economy solutions as it aims at increasing the service lifetime of entire products or specific components, which may reduce the demand for new, resource-consuming devices. To assess the potential of disassembling and subsequent remanufacturing of EV batteries, we present a discrete event simulation approach. This approach depicts the life cycle of batteries and EVs separately, which allows capturing the demand for spare batteries and the potential contribution of remanufacturing batteries to cover this demand. By running various scenarios taking the German EV market as an example, the importance of providing cost-effective spare batteries through remanufacturing is underlined. As a baseline, a linear case is examined, where remanufacturing is not an option. Additionally, we built scenarios where remanufactured batteries are used as spare parts for older vehicles. Another major variation is introduced by different average battery lifetimes (10, 15, and 20 years), while the average vehicle lifetime is 15 years in all cases. The results show that remanufactured spare batteries could decrease the demand for new batteries compared to the linear base case. When battery lifetimes are lower than those of vehicles, new battery demand could be reduced by 6–7%, given our assumptions. In future scenarios where expected battery lifetimes might exceed vehicle lifetimes, up to 2% savings in new batteries could still be possible. Therefore, remanufacturing could be a viable option for improving the sustainability of electric mobility, and (re)manufacturers should consider intensifying their engagement in designing remanufacturable batteries, in research on remanufacturing technologies, and in investing in remanufacturing infrastructure.","Huster S., Glöser-Chahoud S., Rosenberg S., Schultmann F.",A simulation model for assessing the potential of remanufacturing electric vehicle batteries as spare parts,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131397365&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.132225&partnerID=40&md5=148a02bae5bcdf16af29af5341035e3c
Omega (United Kingdom),"Remanufacturing is a sustainable practice, as it can save resources and alleviate environmental pollution. However, the production process can be subject to yield uncertainty if the manufacturer has limited remanufacturing capability. This study considers a retailer that sells both new and remanufactured products simultaneously. The retailer can either produce the remanufactured product in-house under yield uncertainty (Scenario I), or remove this uncertainty by relying on a third-party remanufacturer (Scenario O). We investigate the retailer's make-or-buy decision under in-store competition (between new and remanufactured products) and find that, remarkably, consumers’ high valuation of the remanufactured product induces the retailer to order an increased quantity of new products in both Scenarios O and I. In addition, we find that the retailer can obtain a higher profit in Scenario O because the new product supplier will strategically lower the wholesale price owing to the intensified supply competition, which could also benefit the new product supplier and, hence, achieve a win–win situation.","Niu B., Bao J., Cao B.",Retailer's make-or-buy decision for remanufactured products under in-house yield uncertainty,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125139030&doi=10.1016%2fj.omega.2022.102627&partnerID=40&md5=8ce9df93e1d9952e333e95943a97cdb9
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Remanufacturing is a sustainable product reutilization strategy to realize responsible consumption and production. However, it has remained a largely untapped opportunity for enhancing productivity due to some behavioral matters such as fairness concerns of remanufacturing related firms. Concerning the emerging and development of remanufacturing industry, this paper provides a game-theoretic analysis for a remanufacturing supply chain (RSC) consisting of one leading manufacturer and a following retailer, with the inclusion of fairness concern. We propose and compare several scenarios of channel members’ fairness preferences as, both members are fairness concerned, only one member is fairness concerned, and both members are fair neutral, to expound how fairness concern affects RSC strategies and resulting utilities. We also demonstrate dynamic evolution and stable state of channel members’ selections of whether being fairness concerned in the long term. Analytical results show that favorable scenarios for the RSC to achieve desired objective are relevant to its preference for improved supply chain performance or enhanced environmental benefit. Whatever the preference is, however, it is detrimental for both members to be fairness concerned in the short term. In the long term, evolutionary stable strategies of fairness concerns indicate that both members or only one member would choose to be fairness concerned. The eventual status relies on the initial state of fairness preference. The results are especially relevant as a reference for remanufacturing related strategies, thus enhancing production sustainability as well as environmental benefits.","Zhang X., Cao J., Zhao Y., Lu J.",Fairness Concern in Remanufacturing Supply Chain—A Comparative Analysis of Channel Members’ Fairness Preferences,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127398547&doi=10.3390%2fsu14073813&partnerID=40&md5=b77b00cc2124a45fe68a890823136355
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Remanufacturing, as a central closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) technique, contributes to the circular economy. While empirical research on remanufacturing has gained the attention of scholars, the crucial aspects of customer decision making – that is, determinants of customers' emotions and how they affect their purchasing decisions – have been neglected. Unlike most of the previous studies, which have used the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to explain environmental behaviours, this study used Stimulus Organism Response theory to explain purchase intention towards remanufactured products. Furthermore, the study extends the literature by investigating the impacts of environmental consciousness, government interference, sellers’ reputation, perceived environmental benefit, perceived knowledge, and perceived risk on intention to purchase remanufactured products through subjective norms, attitudes, and perceived behavioural control. A total of 253 useable data were collected and analysed using Partial Least Squares (PLS), as a symmetric analysis technique, and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), as an asymmetric technique. The findings from PLS found that subjective norms and perceived knowledge have non-significant effects on intention to purchase and attitude respectively. However, the findings from fsQCA showed that all factors play a role in shaping the intention to purchase remanufactured products and identified more heterogeneous combinations of stimuli and emotions to predict purchase intentions. Besides theoretical contributions, the study has numerous practical implications for government agencies and industry players aiming to enhance customer intention to purchase remanufactured products.","Abbasi G.A., Chee Keong K.Q., Kumar K.M., Iranmanesh M.",Asymmetrical modelling to understand purchase intention towards remanufactured products in the circular economy and a closed-loop supply chain: An empirical study in Malaysia,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130334597&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.132137&partnerID=40&md5=534336d3b96722887d751434ac42405a
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Renewable energy is now the world’s most reliable and sustainable solution to environmental pollution, the energy crisis, and social sustainability. In order to regulate renewable energies and ensure the sustainable development of renewable energy in China, a regulatory framework is imperative. Electricity demand and supply forecasting have become one of the most important topics for research on sustainable solutions to energy issues. This article analyzes the Chinese electric power industry structure by looking at historical electricity demand and supply data. This study shows how a divergent set of energy policies can facilitate the application of renewable energy to China’s electric power sector. The analysis shows that in 2020, China’s electricity generation and consumption increased by 0.9 and 1.3 percent annually, respectively, producing capacity of power plants increased by 5.6 GW, coal consumption of power supply decreased by 4.3 g/kWh, power generation projects investment increased by 51.6 billion RMB, power grid projects investment decreased by 1.8 billion RMB, and newly installed generation capacity increased by 769 GW year on year (YOY). During the first three quarters of 2021, the generation, consumption and coal consumption of electricity increased respectively by 10.7 and 12.9%, the generating capacity of power plants increased by 9.4 GW, the average coal consumption of power supply decreased by 0.9 g/kWh, power generation projects investment increased by 1.8 billion RMB, while power grid projects investment decreased by 0.3 billion RMB and new generation capacity added around 20.16 GW compared to the same period last year.

International Journal of Production Economics,"Research has shown the need for business organizations to be ambidextrous, which means they should possess the ability to simultaneously exploit existing competencies and explore novel opportunities for improved organizational performance. Past evidence suggests that corporate environmental and financial performance may benefit from well-organized logistics operations. Meanwhile, the causality between the performances has been continuously debated, and the role of ambidexterity in the relationship is largely unexplored. We argue that ambidexterity in logistics operations enhances the link between environmental and financial performance. Using longitudinal data from Finnish manufacturing and trading firms, we applied regression analysis to test a theory-driven moderation model. Our findings indicate that ambidexterity in logistics operations affects the strength of the virtuous cycle between environmental and financial performance. Notably, the stronger the explorative orientation in logistics in a firm, the more enhanced the link between their environmental and financial performances. Overall, firms may find it challenging for their available resources to be employed for environmental and financial sustainability unless they are ambidextrous. Financial resources and environmental investments are necessary conditions but not sufficient for performance improvements in themselves; they need to be coupled with a desire to seek new, innovative solutions rather than just exploit existing practices. Combining exploitative and explorative orientations in logistics helps businesses meet divergent stakeholder expectations and translate their resources into performance. To this end, logistics operations should be organized to support organizational performance through an active search for new solutions as well as investments to develop both existing and new logistics practices.","Rintala O., Laari S., Solakivi T., Töyli J., Nikulainen R., Ojala L.",Revisiting the relationship between environmental and financial performance: The moderating role of ambidexterity in logistics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127009996&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108479&partnerID=40&md5=6e936e44f0b3fae884e11bd16273a58e
Annals of Operations Research,"Research on the development of sustainable supply chain models is highly active nowadays. Merging the concept of supply chain management with sustainable development goals, leads to simultaneous consideration of all economic, environmental and social factors. This paper addresses the design of a sustainable closed-loop supply chain including suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers, customer zones, and disposal centers considering the consumption of energy. In addition, the distribution centers play the roles of warehouse and collection centers. The problem involves three choices of remanufacturing, recycling, and disposing the returned items. The objectives are including the total profit, energy consumption and the number of created job opportunities. As far as we know, these objectives are rarely considered in a sustainable closed-loop supply chain model. The proposed model also responds to the customer demand and also addresses the real-life constraints for location, allocation and inventory decisions in a closed-loop supply chain framework. Another novelty of this research is to develop a set of efficient Lagrangian relaxation reformulations and fast heuristics for solving a real-world numerical example.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Research shows a linear economy of “take-use-dispose” is no longer viable given the current state of the natural environment, hence a transition to a Circular Economy (CE), where resources flow in cyclical systems, is required. Yet the complexity of such a transition – requiring reconfiguring supply chains and, therefore, multi-level collaboration – cannot be underestimated. Understanding how the infrastructure industry should transition to a CE requires the exploration of collaborative models that allow the participation of multi-level stakeholders interacting towards the effective implementation of CE strategies. While a review of the literature identifies drivers, barriers and enablers for CE in the built environment, a dearth of research exists on enabling models which address the many barriers associated with implementation. A case study provides empirical evidence of how a collaborative multi-level platform to support the transition to CE at an industry level was co-designed, addressing drivers, barriers and enablers of CE initiatives in the built environment. Reflections on the process of co-designing the Infrastructure CoLab also reveal key factors in the success of the collaboration, providing a checklist for others seeking to implement similar initiatives. Findings also suggest meso (industry) level collaborative initiatives have the potential to act as a bridge between micro and macro levels allowing integration from a micro (product) level to a macro (urban planning/eco-cities) level, reflecting a combined top-down, bottom-up approach.","Meath C., Karlovšek J., Navarrete C., Eales M., Hastings P.",Co-designing a multi-level platform for industry level transition to circular economy principles: A case study of the infrastructure CoLab,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126557043&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.131080&partnerID=40&md5=45c00906fed3ea92a2428bd443adb34a

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Resilience and sustainability are two critical factors in supply chain networks (SCNs) to assure business continuity and achieve competitive advantages. Due to the dynamic interconnections between the several parts that comprise a typical SCN such as customers, organizations, sites, departments, geographies, and so on, efficient collaboration between all parts is vital to assure business success, especially in times of uncertainty and unpredictable disruption. Collaborative risks such as poor communication, deficient information exchange, lack of trust, lack or deficient access or reach, just to name a few, that essentially emerge as a result from a shift toward one of the extremes of the collaborative dimension (lack of collaboration or collaborative overload) are very often invisible; however, they are responsible for undesired outcomes such as production defects and delivery delays, just to name a few. In this work, a strategic process to identify and manage collaborative risks in SCNs to help improve resilience and sustainability is proposed. The proposed strategic process analysis contains three key SCN’s collaborative dimensions ((1) network access or reach, (2) trust, and (3) communication) applying graph centrality metrics, looking for emergent collaborative risks in a quantitative way that potentially may threaten an organization’s efficiency and performance, and thus negatively impact resilience and sustainability. A case study conducted in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic is illustrated to describe how organization benefit regarding the timely and quantitative identification of potential behavioral patterns that lead to one of the collaborative extremes.

This article presents a Supply Chain Network (SCN) model that can be used to regulate downstream relationships towards a sustainable SME using a 4-component cost function structure — Environmental (E), Demand (D), Economic (E), and Social (S). As a major generalization to the existing practice of using phenomenological interrelationships between the EDES cost kernels, we propose a complementary time varying model of a cost function, based on Lagrangian mechanics (incorporating SCN constraints through Lagrange multipliers), to analyze the time evolution of the SCN variables to interpret the competition between economic inertia and market potential. Multicriteria decision making, based on an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), ranks performance quality, identifying key business decision makers.

In this research work, blockchain technology and business analytics techniques were critically analyzed in the context of supply chain. Global and local governmental bodies, consumers, and communities are putting pressure to meet sustainability goals, which prompts us to investigate how these technologies can address and aid remanufacturing and recycling practices and sustainability in supply chain. The results illustrate that advanced technologies have a key role in the implementation of remanufacturing and recycling practices. The results also indicate that the remanufacturing and recycling practices substantially improve automobile firm performance. Moreover, the results also indicated that Covid-19 pandemic has positive moderating effect between advanced technology and remanufacturing and recycling practices while having insignificant effect between remanufacturing and recycling practices and automobile firm performance.","Yu Z., Umar M., Rehman S.A.",Adoption of technological innovation and recycling practices in automobile sector: under the Covid-19 pandemic,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129898630&doi=10.1007%2fs12063-022-00263-x&partnerID=40&md5=ea0c1cf02526e6ee44f683214e390910
Business Strategy and the Environment,"Risk management in the base of the pyramid (BoP) environment is needed to ensure that firms performance objectives are met. Accordingly, integrating sustainability performance measurement in the supply chain risk management would offer interesting avenues for managing risks in BoP supply chain. Therefore, the paper conceptualizes an intersection between supply chain risk/uncertainty management and sustainable performance measurement. This intersection is then tested by a literature review of 164 BoP SC articles between the years 2000 and 2022. Descriptive, frequency, and correlation analysis identify various risks factors studied in the BoP literature so far, their management strategies and respective performance measures. The findings show a broad strategical aspect of managing SC risks and proffered the tactical or operational level performance measures which along with these practices can manage the related risks. Therefore, their incorporation into the risk management process should be considered. The correlation findings highlight the important role of performance process measures and the impact of these along with the management practices on firm's performance outcomes. The study contributes to supply chain risk and performance management literature by capturing the nexus between BoP and supply chain management.","Aman S., Seuring S., Khalid R.U.",Sustainability performance measurement in risk and uncertainty management: An analysis of base of the pyramid supply chain literature,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139604756&doi=10.1002%2fbse.3254&partnerID=40&md5=5e3d0e2a0a7e80e5bdee817ee8d57de8
Food Research,"Risk management is very important in supporting business sustainability. The choice of risk mitigation strategy is very crucial. An alternative strategy that is considered very effective in managing risk is a proactive strategy. This review was aimed to find out the strategy of risk mitigation proactive in general supply chain, resilience strategy in the food supply chain, and the relationship between proactive risk mitigation strategies and supply chain resilience strategies. Supply chain resilience is the focal point of management to be task-oriented towards improvement, determination and continuity. Therefore, the mitigation process is an inseparable part of building supply chain resilience. The role of risk management provides important value for the company, there are four elements used to build or develop supply chain resilience, including supply chain (re-) engineering, collaboration, agility and risk awareness.

Symmetry,"Road haulage solutions are incredibly adaptable, having the capacity to link domestically and internationally. Road transportation offers a greener, more efficient, and safer future through sophisticated technology. Symmetry and asymmetry exist widely in industrial applications, and logistics and supply chains are no exception. The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model is considered as a complexity tool to balance the symmetry between goals and conflicting criteria. This study can assist stakeholders in understanding the current state of transportation networks and planning future sustainability measures through the MCDM approach. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate and compare the sustainable development of existing road transportation systems to determine whether any of them can be effectively developed in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The integrated entropy–CoCoSo approach for evaluating the sustainability of road transportation systems is introduced, and the framework process is proposed. The entropy method defines the weight of the decision criteria based on the real data. The advantage of the entropy method is that it reduces the subjective impact of decision-makers and increases objectivity. The CoCoSo method is applied for ranking the road transportation sustainability performance of OECD countries. Our findings revealed the top three countries’ sustainability performance: Japan, Germany, and France. These are countries with developed infrastructure and transportation services. Iceland, the United States, and Latvia were in the last rank among countries. This approach helps governments, decision-makers, or policyholders review current operation, benchmark the performance of other countries and devise new strategies for road transportation development to achieves better results.","Wang C.-N., Le T.Q., Chang K.-H., Dang T.-T.",Measuring Road Transport Sustainability Using MCDM-Based Entropy Objective Weighting Method,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130884216&doi=10.3390%2fsym14051033&partnerID=40&md5=4ef8f113b041a897f7394d9416c2b163
Science of the Total Environment,"Salmon is a nutritious and popular food among consumers predominantly in wealthy countries around the world. Since the mid-1990s farmed salmon production has exceeded wild salmon harvest, and is now 80 % of total global salmon supply. The environmental impacts of farmed salmon are frequently discussed and consumers are faced with a multitude of choices even after deciding to have salmon for dinner: species, production method, origin, product form. We present life cycle impacts of fresh and frozen salmon products, originating in purse seine fisheries for pink salmon and gill net fisheries for sockeye salmon in Alaska, when sold on markets in Europe and the United States. Norwegian salmon products are then modelled to the same markets in fresh and frozen form, based on literature data. Impact categories included were greenhouse gas emissions, marine eutrophication, marine ecotoxicity and land use. A fish in, fish out ratio is also calculated and differences in content of nutrients and contaminants described. Frozen products from wild sockeye and pink salmon had the lowest emissions in both markets. For consumers in the U.S. and Europe, wild salmon products have 46–86 % and 12–71 % lower greenhouse gas emissions than farmed Norwegian salmon, respectively, depending on species and product form. Farmed salmon also had higher land use, marine ecotoxic and eutrophying emissions and fish in, fish out ratio. Important differences exist in nutritional and contaminant content between the three types of salmon production. Improvement options as well as an optimized supply chain are modelled showing greenhouse gas reduction opportunities of 40–50 % also for the best performing chains. Results can be used as a baseline for improved data collection and emission reductions. Recommendations for consumers, industry and policymakers who can facilitate and even drive development towards more sustainable salmon products are provided.","Ziegler F., Hilborn R.",Fished or farmed: Life cycle impacts of salmon consumer decisions and opportunities for reducing impacts,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138091269&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.158591&partnerID=40&md5=2ca55d9853cb15598a003eb1292e040c
Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments,"Scarcity of resources and risks to the energy supply have motivated a search for sustainable ways to produce alternative fuels using the concept of the circular economy, with the hope of meeting the sustainable development goals (SGD). Waste cooking oil (WCO) is a secondary resource in the production of second-generation (2G) biofuel and is an alternative sustainable fuel that can provide both economic and environmental benefits. This research investigated the use of WCO in biofuel production using the approach of system dynamics (SD) to analyze three scenarios over the period of time from 2020 to 2030. These three scenarios were baseline, non-sustainable and sustainable. The analysis simulated the three scenarios, and created a visualization of the circular supply chain of WCO in Brazil, and created a model that gave an overview of the situation. The analysis revealed that biofuels made from WCO are sensitive to the rates of disposal, recycling, water pollution, CO2 emissions and biofuel production in the three scenarios. The finding suggests that the baseline and non-sustainable scenarios are similar, and that the sustainable scenario could result in significant benefits by increasing the production of biodiesel production from WCO, and reducing the environmental impact.","Soares de Carvalho Freitas E., Xavier L.H., Oliveira L.B., Guarieiro L.L.N.",System dynamics applied to second generation biofuel in Brazil: A circular economy approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132381495&doi=10.1016%2fj.seta.2022.102288&partnerID=40&md5=30385185cda9804464ce803c3d026c88

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Scholars believe that the newly introduced Industry 5.0 has the potential to move beyond the profit-centered productivity of Industry 4.0 and to promote sustainable development goals such as human-centricity, socio-environmental sustainability, and resilience. However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values.

Journal of Rural Studies,"Scholars have often applied the concept of boundary work and its conceptual progeny to explain how science, policy, and practice collaborate to introduce change into agrifood systems. However, previous studies focused primarily on specific boundary elements (i.e., boundary spanners, boundary organizations, and boundary objects) or particular innovation processes (in terms of scope or timescale) within broad transformative change. This study aims to deepen the understanding of long-term transformative processes in agri-food systems by looking at how boundary infrastructures influenced the evolution of the Brazilian pig production system from a setting in which it mainly produced pork lard for a domestic market to a setting of being integrated in global supply chains and following international standards. Mainly, we add to the extant literature by highlighting that boundary infrastructures influenced the longterm transformative process experienced by BPPS by establishing a space where science-policy-practice interactions legitimized particular visions and values and instilled responsibility and accountability to spur various joint actions in support of innovation. We also contribute to the extant literature by showing that boundary infrastructures evolution in BPPS was incremental, long-term, multi-site, and with intertwined leverage. Boundary infrastructures provide structuration to system transformation and are also (re)structured while transitions unfold. Since boundary infrastructures have a certain directionality and may become hegemonic and exclusionary, this requires sensitiveness to the need to reorient a hegemonic boundary infrastructure or create a parallel one. Our study deepens the understanding of how coordination unfolds in long-term transformative processes, a topic deemed of interest given current debates on promoting agri-food systems transformation. We argue that better awareness of boundary infrastructures in which science-policy-practice interactions occur can help guide the direction of innovation to support sustainability transitions in agri-food systems.","Vilas-Boas J., Klerkx L., Lie R.","Connecting science, policy, and practice in agri-food system transformation: The role of boundary infrastructures in the evolution of Brazilian pig production",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120633657&doi=10.1016%2fj.jrurstud.2021.11.025&partnerID=40&md5=a5c3fb6a2a514c17ecd7fe86f4c6c806

A weighting method was used to prioritise the critical hotspots. For empirical evidence, a few hotspots were addressed using Walmart's best practices and modified LCA was piloted that showed up to 10% decreased environmental burden, irrespective of the change in region, data mix and supply chain complexity.

Current Research in Environmental Sustainability,"Seafood production in required quantities is facing increasing pressures due to reasons such as rising population, increasing demand, overfishing, landing of by-catch, climate change-related biodiversity changes, extinction of species and others. At the same time, industrial production of value added fishery products generates significant amounts of nutrient-rich discards, besides voluminous amount of process effluents. These discards, by-catch and effluents are rich sources of nutrients, industrially important ingredients and also bio-energy. Developments in marine biotechnology offer novel eco- friendly green processes for bio-refining of discarded seafood portions. This article discusses potentials of green processing for the valorization of seafood discards and process effluents towards zero waste that can improve sustainable seafood supply chain. The green processes generally make use of bioconversions of discards to release components attached to food matrices, which are extracted by suitable downstream processing techniques. Algal biotechnology and biorefinery-based approaches have significant scope for commercial scale processing of seafood discards. Because of their functional nature, the isolated products can have valuable applications in health, therapeutic and industries in other fields.

In-depth, semi-structured interviews using open-ended questions were conducted. Content and thematic, textual, and quantitative analyses were performed. We found four clusters of interviewees who differed in social backgrounds and motivations for eating “in season.” A social divide between individuals for whom “eating seasonally” was a priority (upper strata), and those who “eat unseasonally” (lower strata) was highlighted. An analysis of motivations showed a contrast between individuals who were familiar with seasonal food rhythms and aimed to support the local economy and the older generation for whom seasonal products gave better value for money. The implications of public action on sustainable consumption are discussed with respect to the knowledge of seasonality, targeted segments of the population, and a combination of arguments to encourage seasonal consumption.","Régnier F., Dalstein A.-L., Rouballay C., Chauvel L.",Eating in Season—A Lever of Sustainability?

Annals of Operations Research,"Selecting a supplier is one of the most important factors in the so-called ‘Supply Chain Management’. In the present article, supplier selection problem is addressed particularly for multivariate processes, i.e. processes having two or more correlated characteristics, with asymmetric specification region. Quality and price play two major roles in selecting suppliers, so does price. In this context, apart from price and quality, some other major criteria for supplier selection are service level agreement (SLA), proximity to the manufacturing facilities, sustainability initiatives and so on (refer Taherdoost and Brard in Proc Manuf 32:1027–1034, 2019). Unfortunately, very little research is available in literature, handling quality and price simultaneously, while dealing with supplier selection. In this article, at first, a multivariate process capability index (MPCI) based approach is adopted using the conventional phase wise hypothesis testing procedure. Next, a graphical representation, called multivariate capability-price comparison (MCPC) chart is proposed, which can accommodate both the quality and price constraints, making the selection of supplier more rational.

Advances in Water Resources,"Several studies addressed the water footprint (WF) of countries and virtual water (VW) trade in agricultural and industrial products, but freshwater use associated with wood products has received little attention. Yet, international trade in wood products has been growing, and forestry competes with other forest ecosystem services over limited freshwater resources. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to assess nations’ WFs of consumption of wood products, the sustainability of these WFs, and the VW flows associated with international trade in wood products. We account nations’ WFs of and VW trade in wood products with a Multi-regional Input-Output model (MRIO-forest) that tracks wood flows along global supply chains (production, processing, trade, and final uses) for the period 1997-2017 and assess the sustainability of the green and blue WF of wood products in 2017. The WF of wood production increased from 8.37 × 1011 m3/y in 1997 to 9.87 × 1011 m3/y in 2017. About 38% (3.76 × 1011 m3/y) of this WF relates to wood products for export (in 2017), which means that VW trade associated with wood products ranks in between agricultural and industrial products in absolute volumes. About 10% (9.9 × 1010 m³/y) of the green WF and 11% (3.4 × 109 m³/y) of the blue WF of wood products in 2017 are unsustainable, meaning that they are located in areas where the total green/blue WF exceeds the maximum sustainable green/blue WF. The unsustainable green WF occurs mainly in Germany, Indonesia, the Czech Republic and the UK, and mainly relates to coniferous sawnwood, paper and paperboard other than newsprint, fibreboard and non-coniferous sawnwood. The unsustainable blue WF, which is much smaller, occurs in the USA, Russia. Nigeria, Canada and India, and mainly relates to fuelwood, paper and paperboard other than newsprint, sawnwood and fibreboard.

Agriculture (Switzerland),"Several studies conducted in various countries have addressed the technical efficiency of dairies. However, there is a paucity of research on the technical efficiency of dairies in Poland, particularly in relation to their legal form (i.e., cooperatives vs. non-cooperatives). The existing literature also does not provide insights into the technical efficiency of these entities with respect to different regions’ milk production capacity. Therefore, this paper aims to: (1) evaluate and compare the technical efficiency of cooperative and non-cooperative dairies in Poland, and (2) examine dairies’ technical efficiency due to spatial disparities in milk production potential. We use data envelopment analysis (DEA) to investigate the technical efficiency of 108 dairies in Poland for the year 2019. The milk production capacity of provinces is examined by applying the zero unitarization method. The results show that when assuming constant returns to scale (CRS), dairy cooperatives are less technically efficient than non-cooperatives, whereas when assuming variable returns to scale (VRS), these differences are not statistically significant. For inefficient dairies, we observe the greatest potential for improvement in labor costs and depreciation. Both cooperatives and non-cooperatives operate mostly under decreasing returns to scale. Thus, the potential for enhancing the technical efficiency of dairies through the consolidation process seems to be exploited.

This study, as part of an emerging theme, presents a systematic review and classification of 42 articles at the intersection of sustainability, reliability, and supply chain network design. In this regard, in a historical course, the four concepts of green supply chain, socially responsible supply chain, sustainable supply chain, and reliable supply chain in the form of four structures of history and definition, deriver and importance, substrate and practice, evaluation, and implementation are discussed. The result of the review shows that the articles that study the integration of sustainability and reliability in SCND are vibrant and rapidly growing in various industries. Developing countries and manufacturing companies with the largest number of articles have been the research fields of the studies. Most of the studies have considered the structure of the supply chain as a forward flow. The key contribution of this review is the development of a comprehensive framework of S&RSC from the conceptual point of view, elements, assessment tools, and its implementation context.

MRS Bulletin,"Significant academic research and moderate commercial process innovation on rare-earth element (REE) processing have been underway for decades. The last several years have seen exponential growth in research due to growth in demand of REE that is threatened by supply risks and environmental obstacles. The REE industry appears to be at the intersection of strong, but conflicting forces, including public and political support for a Green Revolution and sustainability, as well as the need for a clean, reliable, and socially responsible supply chain. REE recoveries from ore are limited by current technology and plant practice to 50–80 percent. Increasing demand can be partially satisfied by recycling, but reliable and continuous increases in supply will also require new mineral resources, improved process efficiency, and lower production costs.

In this research, the concept of FH has been used for a more effective and faster connection of consumers to production sites. Due to prevention of the spread of coronavirus and the quarantine conditions, the areas have been divided into two parts (high-risk and low-risk) and two scenarios have been defined for this supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to reduce costs and environmental impacts as much as possible. The proposed model is solved by GAMS software for small- and middle-size test problems, and it is solved with genetic optimization algorithm as a meta-heuristic approach for large-size problems. Also, to solve the developed linear multi-objective model, augmented ɛ-constraint approach is applied, and a real case study from Iran is examined to illustrate the validation of the proposed model. Numerical and computational results are provided to prove the efficiency and feasibility of the presented model. Finally, sensitivity analysis is presented to evaluate the effect of changing some parameters on variables and objective functions.","Azani M., Shaerpour M., Yazdani M.A., Aghsami A., Jolai F.",A Novel Scenario-Based Bi-objective Optimization Model for Sustainable Food Supply Chain During the COVID-19: a Case Study,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118860965&doi=10.1007%2fs41660-021-00203-5&partnerID=40&md5=4b0358e78094ded79eb2c59de962dd5d
Research in Transportation Business and Management,"Since port activity is essential for countless supply chains, its operational efficiency is a relevant research topic for logistics and transport management. In order to be able to analyze, measure and improve its performance, it is necessary to establish evaluation criteria that take into account not only economic aspects, but also society and the environment. However, this type of evaluation generally uses deterministic data for the performance indicators, distorting the real result of its values and hindering adequate decision-making. Thus, this research aims to propose a probabilistic analysis of container terminals' sustainable performance, taking into account uncertainties that the indicators' values can assume. Methodologically, the study was supported by secondary data collection in nine container terminals, followed by a Gray Relational Analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation. With respect to the case study, it is observed that the indicator “number of jobs generated” is the one that most penalized the sustainable performance of the analyzed terminals, whereas, antagonistically, the “net revenue” had little influence on the sustainability indexes. Also noteworthy is that the generation of performance probability curves for each terminal promoted a more appropriate analysis for decision-making at the corporate and governmental levels.","Leal Junior I.C., de Oliveira U.R., Guimarães V.D.A., Ribeiro L.G., Aprigliano Fernandes V.",Probabilistic analysis of the sustainable performance of container terminals,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116932065&doi=10.1016%2fj.rtbm.2021.100725&partnerID=40&md5=65a3f1c6ee8479470f817eec7092fe4c

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Since the economic crisis in 2008, the world has seen a partly negative shift in social progress, highlighting that current economic models and practices do not guarantee long-lasting societal and human wellbeing. Economic models and business practices are deeply intertwined; thus, businesses play a major role in the advancement of social sustainability, and academic research can offer support in navigating the complexity of this issue. However, social sustainability tends to be under-researched. This article summarizes the discussion in general business management, product development, and supply-chain management, and from this suggest a research agenda to help in guiding systematic change in business organizations towards social sustainability. The article identifies ten main challenges and offers five recommendations to move the field forward, namely, a more explicit engagement with and discussion of social systems-science based ideas, and a more explicit determination as a field to converge on key pieces leading towards a clearer definition of the concept. Lastly, it recommends that research needs to focus on how to overcome fragmented organizational structures, how to achieve true integration into existing processes and tools, and how to support organizations to become more dynamic in working with these issues.","Missimer M., Mesquita P.L.",Social Sustainability in Business Organizations: A Research Agenda,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125329150&doi=10.3390%2fsu14052608&partnerID=40&md5=fa35abc0bad0484cabd67c8a37d7c766

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Since the mid-1990s, there has been a growing interest among consumers and producers in downscaling to a local level the length of the agri-food chains as a solution for fairer and more sustainable food production systems. From the point of view of consumption, the attribute “local” is assuming an important role in defining food purchasing preferences, both in terms of expectations of product quality and in terms of its perceived relevance in determining the supply chain sustainability. This research aims to define how individuals’ perception of local production influences the definition of “local” among consumers based on a survey submitted to a sample of 500 consumers in North-Western Italy. The paper provides: (i) a semantic map built on keywords adopted by the respondents to describe local production; (ii) a categorization of food consumers divided in clusters on the basis of their eating styles; and (iii) a characterization of consumers clusters according to the preferences and knowledge expressed towards local production. The results show that consumers’ awareness and attitudes towards the concept of the “local” are influenced by the joint effect of their socio-demographic profile and their food consumption style, with some unexpected evidences that would deserve to be deepen with further research. However, given this uncertainty, three main traits seem to characterize the consumers attitude towards the “local”: a positive relation among the dimensions of environment, local development and product quality and the strength of the link between local production and the reduction of the length of the supply chain. Ultimately, territoriality is perceived as an index of higher product quality (seasonal, therefore fresh and genuine).","Merlino V.M., Sciullo A., Pettenati G., Sottile F., Peano C., Massaglia S.",“Local Production”: What Do Consumers Think?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127379966&doi=10.3390%2fsu14063623&partnerID=40&md5=276f1ec66d745b37c344c2ea24c19a38
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Since the mid-2010s, the circular economy has emerged as a key conceptual lever in corporate efforts to achieve greater environmental sustainability. Corporations have increasingly drawn upon the circular economy perspective in efforts to rethink sustainable supply chain management practices. This new corporate approach to sustainable supply chain management is evident in an emerging literature that has yet to be fully documented. In this systematic review of research, bibliometric methods were applied to a database of 709 Scopus-indexed documents. Author co-citation analysis identified four schools of thought comprising the intellectual structure of this literature: Sustainable Production and Environmental Management, Sustainable Supply Chain Management, Reverse Supply Chain Management, and Circular Economy. Synthesis of these themes suggests that the adoption of a circular economy perspective is transforming sustainable supply chain management in two important ways. First, this perspective reorients supply chain management away from a narrow focus on efficiency and waste reduction and towards a new paradigm of redesign, reuse, and product transformation. Second, adoption of the circular economy highlights and leverages reverse cycles in the supply chain. Thus, circular economy business models enable supply chain management to enhance corporate contributions to sustainable production and consumption. Drawing upon this framing of supply chain management within a circular economy, the review proposes a new framework for accelerating corporate sustainability.","Theeraworawit M., Suriyankietkaew S., Hallinger P.",Sustainable Supply Chain Management in a Circular Economy: A Bibliometric Review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137251777&doi=10.3390%2fsu14159304&partnerID=40&md5=e67cee47c1d5744fd1978716d1c9abed
Frontiers in Energy Research,"Site selection modeling receives much attention in the aviation biofuels literature to ensure sustainability of the aviation biofuel supply chain. These models seek to reflect the multitude of factors and conditions necessary for supply chain success. Social factors impacting that success have received increasingly greater attention but are often excluded due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and standard measures. Some of the most promising work in this arena utilizes a “community capitals approach” to create statistically grounded decision support tools (DSTs) intended to provide rapid assessment of the social characteristics of potential facility locations. Despite the value of the community capitals approach, this methodology is still marked by inconsistent predictivity due to an inability to reliably assess the cultural and historical nuances of local communities that are so vitally important to the long-term viability of these costly projects. This paper more fully examines the Community Assets and Attributes Model (CAAM) that has been developed and applied in the Pacific Northwest to incorporate social assets in site selection modeling. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Colorado and Wyoming dealing with biomass/bioenergy facility siting, we argue that cultural capital, a key component of the CAAM, is biased to urban locations due to the measurements incorporated. As a result of this bias, current site selection modeling based on the Community Capitals Framework (CCF) does not accurately reflect rural community assets. We assert that the CAAM does not actually measure cultural capital but a product of cultural capital, namely creativity, and innovation Our mixed methods approach that combines quantitative assessment with ethnographic research highlights the limits of the CAAM by revealing that local residents in largely rural counties showed willingness to innovate in some cases but in others referred to history with similar industries that may limit support. The quantitative cultural capital measurements of the CAAM for the four counties we examine, which range in scores from −0.53 to 2, do not capture these dynamics. These scores would generally suggest moderate to high levels of support for biomass/bioenergy facilities, but the ethnographic research provides nuance for or against support that are not reflected in the quantitative capital scores. This suggests that the quantitative CAAM scores could be misleading without added qualitative context. This work demonstrates that a mixed methods approach, combining ethnographic and historical methodologies with existing quantitative community capital approaches, will produce a more effective predictive methodology for facility siting due to its heightened ability to gather critical data on place-based values, beliefs, and historical legacies relating to natural resource development in general, and the timber industry specifically.

Journal of Dairy Science,"Small-medium dairy enterprises may verify the possibility to enhance their margins by shortening the supply chain. We propose a short sequence of marketing actions with the aim to support the inclusion of transformed goods into their productive process. These actions include the assessment of the main factors affecting consumer cheese purchase decision, evaluation of the validity of the association brand product, and identification of the preferred cheese format. Eighty-two consumers were selected. Their motives for purchasing pasta filata cheese were assessed using the food choice questionnaire. They were also asked to rate their preference for 4 different traditional pasta filata cheeses and 3 well-known local cheese brands. The frequency of consumption of 4 different Mozzarella cheese formats (standard Mozzarella, bite-size Mozzarella, cherries, knots or braids) was gathered. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the food choice questionnaire scores. Purchase intentions were subjected to ANOVA with 2 factors (brand and cheese) and their interaction. The frequencies of consumption of the 4 different Mozzarella formats was analyzed using the χ2 test for independent samples. Based on our results, the communication around pasta filata cheese should focus on intrinsic characteristics such as healthiness and sensory properties, whereas standard Mozzarella with good nutritional and eating quality should be the most produced item and marketed if the associated brand product is well received by the consumers. By shortening the supply chain an increased economic and environmental sustainability can be expected.","Braghieri A., Pacelli C., Riviezzi A.M., Di Cairano M., Napolitano F.",Promoting the direct sale of pasta filata cheese,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135315188&doi=10.3168%2fjds.2021-21285&partnerID=40&md5=1e8d4a1bdc01129f3eeff47aaaa3019f

IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"Smart cities have become a trend with improved efficiency, resilience, and sustainability, providing citizens with high quality of life. With the increasing demand for a more participatory and bottom–up governance approach, citizens play an active role in the process of policy making, revolutionizing the management of smart cities. In the example of urban infrastructure maintenance, the public participation demand is more remarkable as the infrastructure condition is closely related to their daily life. Although blockchain has been widely explored to benefit data collection and processing in smart city governance, public engagement remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a novel public participation consortium blockchain system for infrastructure maintenance that is expected to encourage citizens to actively participate in the decision-making process and enable them to witness all administrative procedures in a real-time manner. To that aim, we introduced a hybrid blockchain architecture to involve a verifier group, which is randomly and dynamically selected from the public citizens, to verify the transaction. In particular, we devised a private-prior peer-prediction-based truthful verification mechanism to tackle the collusion attacks from public verifiers. Then, we specified a Stackelberg-game-based incentive mechanism for encouraging public participation. Finally, we conducted extensive simulations to reveal the properties and performances of our proposed blockchain system, which indicates its superiority over other variations.","Bai Y., Hu Q., Seo S.-H., Kang K., Lee J.J.",Public Participation Consortium Blockchain for Smart City Governance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110900867&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3091151&partnerID=40&md5=88e4e74b360835e9aec5ab2d70fff59d
Studies in Agricultural Economics,"Social enterprises have both economic and social motivations. This hybridity also determines their business model: these companies survive economically in a sometimes very competitive market by fulfilling their main objectives to achieve their social mission. In Hungary, the number of social enterprises within the catering industry is minimal; however, the para-gastro movement collects companies with catering or food processing activities that employs disabled and/or disadvantaged workers. This paper investigates the three most prominent members of the Hungarian para-gastro movement that consider sourcing inputs via short food supply chains as an opportunity. Based on a mixed methods approach, we can conclude that these enterprises must face all the industry’s difficulties, and their unique circumstances might make their operations even more difficult. Taking into account the support these enterprises have received in pursuit of their social goals, the opportunities provided by the short food supply chains can help them only if they are also able to find a niche market where solvent demand can accept the specialties of local sourcing.","Török Á., Agárdi I., Maró G., Maró Z.M.",Business opportunities in short food supply chains: the economic sustainability of three Hungarian para-gastro restaurants,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129395506&doi=10.7896%2fj.2253&partnerID=40&md5=fe48975c2421609731c9ca7019fe2f8c
Production Planning and Control,"Social sustainability issues such as labour rights concern in the agricultural sector receive significant attention from several stakeholders. The role of small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) that dominate the sector’s supply chain in developing countries remains critical in implementing initiatives to address these issues. Through a four-phase methodology, this study proposed the criteria of a socially sustainable supply chain (SSSC) guided by ISO 26000 and based on empirical evidence from the cashew industry. Subsequently, based on the Best worst method and Grey relational analysis, the criteria are evaluated by cashew manufacturing SME managers to determine how SSSC initiatives can be implemented. The study shows that food safety, labour and work condition, traceability, and child and force/prison labour emerge in order of importance as a pathway for implementation of SSSC. The study also provides insight into achieving SSSC among various manufacturing SMEs and understanding their assessed SSSC performance. The study suggests that agricultural sector SMEs that implement SSSC practices through social compliance or collaborations are more aware of the implementation challenges. On the other hand, SMEs that generate SSSC practices may perceive their social sustainability performance in the supply chain much higher than adopters who meet customers’ sustainability requirements.","Agyemang M., Kusi-Sarpong S., Agyemang J., Jia F., Adzanyo M.",Determining and evaluating socially sustainable supply chain criteria in agri-sector of developing countries: insights from West Africa cashew industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098560476&doi=10.1080%2f09537287.2020.1852479&partnerID=40&md5=f4c05ae506d83c09ad1f3b6adc8d785f
Sustainable Development,"Social sustainability, the social dimension of sustainable development goals (SDGs), is getting increasing attention in recent years. The issues of social sustainability are very challenging in the textile and clothing supply chain especially in emerging economies. This article proposes a modified fuzzy interpretive structural modelling (fuzzy ISM) for analysing the contextual relationships among the barriers of social sustainability. Twenty barriers are shortlisted based on review of literature and experts' opinion. The contextual relationships among the barriers are captured in form of linguistic ratings given by the experts. Using the modified fuzzy ISM method, an eight-level hierarchical model is developed. The lack of consumer awareness is found to be the most important driving barrier. The other important driving barriers are lack of strict implementation of government laws and regulation, and lack of financial support from the Government and trade bodies. This study shows that the issues of social sustainability in the textile and clothing supply chain can be addressed by increasing consumer awareness, coercive pressure from the regulatory bodies, and financial aids and incentives to supply chain partners. This study contributes to the methodology by developing an improved interpretive model of decision making. The hierarchical and contextual relationships among the social sustainability barriers have been deciphered. The study also utilises organisational change management theory to address the barriers of adoption of social sustainability.

Central European Journal of Operations Research,"Societal awareness and legislation changes concerning sustainability have affected how organizations generate value for stakeholders, as well as their processes, products, and public relations. In the context of increasing environmental and social awareness, more studies are needed regarding reverse logistics lot-sizing control taking into account sustainability principles. The contribution of this study is the incorporation of sustainable costs in reverse logistics processes using the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model. This paper proposes the extension of a mathematical model for lot-sizing in the reverse logistics that considers environmental, social, and economic parameters. A numerical example and sensitivity analyses are presented to evaluate the sustainable EOQ. Our results indicate that carbon prices have a significant impact on the remanufacturing tax, i.e. the proportion of reusable items in a reverse supply chain that are successfully remanufactured. Additionally, a perspective on the social impact on lot sizing is discussed by noting that high social costs, calculated as a function of ergonomic conditions, can invalidate a high remanufacturing tax. As a consequence, poorly planned labour conditions in reverse logistics can lead to lower recycling rates due to inefficient use of social resources.","Condeixa L.D., Silva P., Moah D., Farias B., Leiras A.",Evaluating cost impacts on reverse logistics using an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model with environmental and social considerations,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089867726&doi=10.1007%2fs10100-020-00707-4&partnerID=40&md5=cd677894ba933e0b99d640391b624815
Business Strategy and the Environment,"Society is facing many challenges, including, climate change, COVID, inequity and human population growth. Some researchers suggest that integration of Circular Economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) concepts and approaches can help us to make progress towards sustainable societies. Integrated implementation can help to improve the design of product–service systems focused on prevention and reduction of wastage of materials, energy, human health, and ecosystems. The CE practices enable consumers to return products after use and to reuse the products with more value. Will integrated adoption of CE and I4.0 practices help society to be more sustainable? What is known about the climate change benefits of integration of I4.0 and CEs to reduce energy and resource usage? The authors sought to answer these questions, via a systematic bibliometric literature review, and network analysis of literature on I4.0 and CE for logistics and supply chain applications. The review was performed by searching the SCOPUS database for literature about I4.0 and CE. A total of 165 articles were shortlisted for in-depth review. The literature review was complimented by bibliometric and network analyses. The review provided insights into the present and future trends in integration of I4.0 and related Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in CE's.

Energy Policy,"Solar energy, including household and community based solar photovoltaic panels, is the fastest growing source of low-carbon electricity worldwide, and it could become the single largest source of renewable energy by mid-century. But what negative equity and justice issues may be associated with its adoption? What risks are being accelerated as solar energy grows exponentially in its deployment? In this study, we rely on a mixed methods research design involving household solar interviews (N = 24), site visits (N = 4 solar neighbourhoods), and a literature review to investigate four types of inequities associated with household solar adoption. We utilize a novel framework looking at demographic inequities (between groups), spatial inequities (across geographic scales), interspecies inequities (between humans and non-humans), and temporal inequities (across present and future generations). This framework enables not only the identification of multiple and often interlinked inequities; it also points the way towards how to make solar energy adoption more sustainable and just, with direct implications for solar business practices (and supply chains) as well as energy and climate policy.","Sovacool B.K., Barnacle M.L., Smith A., Brisbois M.C.",Towards improved solar energy justice: Exploring the complex inequities of household adoption of photovoltaic panels,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127065973&doi=10.1016%2fj.enpol.2022.112868&partnerID=40&md5=78008aeaf92321b6dc8ae0a8a662c894
Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications,"Solar photovoltaics (PV) are the fastest growing renewable energy technologies for clean, cheap, and sustainable electricity generation. To prepare for rapid scale-up, the PV industry needs to project material requirements to build out all aspects of the supply chain appropriately and plan to handle large volumes of module waste. Impacts of deploying different material circularity strategies to reduce waste and conserve primary resources need to be quantified to inform sustainable material management. Here, we introduce the photovoltaic dynamic material flow analysis (PV DMFA) model based on PV electricity generation. The model quantifies material flows and stocks in the cradle-to-cradle life cycles of utility-scale c-Si PV systems in the United States through 2100. We present case studies for solar flat glass and aluminum frame materials under various scenarios to project the impacts of PV performance, reliability, and processing parameters, material circularity strategies, and module design shifts. In the absence of circularity measures, ~100 million MT of flat glass and ~12 million MT of aluminum would be needed for PV installations by 2100 to meet projected growth in domestic utility PV demand to nearly 1000 TWh in 2100. With optimistic but feasible improvements in efficiency, reliability, and circularity, material intensity and waste could be reduced by nearly 50%. Efficient module collection, minimally intrusive recycling, and careful scrap handling and cleaning could improve material circularity in the PV value chain. This model serves as a sustainability data support tool that may aid in the circular economy transition for PV systems.","Khalifa S.A., Mastrorocco B.V., Au D.D., Ovaitt S., Barnes T.M., Carpenter A.C., Baxter J.B.",Dynamic material flow analysis of silicon photovoltaic modules to support a circular economy transition,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127241855&doi=10.1002%2fpip.3554&partnerID=40&md5=4e1f5ae8650d52b7273da3eee022b073
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Some inventory items deteriorate and lose their useful life while in storage due to evaporation, spoilage, pilferage, and chemical or mechanical breakdown. Some examples of this phenomenon are the inventories of fresh food, batteries, electronic items, and petroleum products (such as gasoline and turpentine). Economic and environmental sustainability requires minimizing deterioration losses in inventories throughout the supply chain while optimizing the ordering decisions. This is especially important for food items because, globally, about one third of the food that is produced for human consumption is wasted, causing economic, environmental, political, and societal problems. Food production consumes large amounts of resources such as land, freshwater, fossil fuels, and labor. The same is true for items such as petroleum and chemical products. Exponential deterioration is a commonly used approach to model this phenomenon, which results in an exponentially decreasing inventory level function. An important extension of the basic economic order quantity (EOQ) model is its application to exponentially deteriorating items. In the exponentially deteriorating items model, the rate of deterioration per unit time for the stocked items is proportional to the amount of available physical inventory at any given time. This results in an exponentially declining inventory level over time. This problem normally does not lend itself to a closed-form optimal solution due to the coexistence of polynomial and exponential terms; hence, approximations are used, but the existing approximations yield closed-form solutions that are far from intuitive. In this research, we develop new approximate closed-form solutions for the basic problem and its backordering extensions that are intuitive and very easy to interpret, as well as more accurate; therefore, they are very attractive to practitioners.

Environmental Science and Technology,"South Korea is a global leader in electronics, but little is known about their climate change impact. Here, we estimate the direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Korean electronics by developing a new and high-resolution (∼380 sectors) environmentally extended input-output model, named KREEIO. We find that final demand for Korean electronics led to nearly 8% of national GHG emissions in 2017, mostly because of indirect emissions embodied in the electronics supply chain. Notably, the semiconductor and display sectors contributed 3.2% and 2.4% to national emissions, with capital investment accounting for 17% of the two sectors’ total emissions or nearly 1% of national emissions. For other electronic products, scope 1, scope 2, and upstream scope 3 emissions on average accounted for 3%, 10%, and 87% of a sector’s GHG intensity, respectively. Detailed contribution analysis suggests that reducing Korean electronics GHG emissions would benefit most from the transition to a low-carbon electricity grid, but mitigation efforts in many other sectors such as metals and chemicals are also important. Overall, our study underscores the significance of electronics GHG emissions in South Korea, especially those from semiconductors and displays, and the mitigation challenges these sectors face as demand continues to grow globally.","Yang Y., Park Y., Smith T.M., Kim T., Park H.-S.",High-Resolution Environmentally Extended Input-Output Model to Assess the Greenhouse Gas Impact of Electronics in South Korea,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124015760&doi=10.1021%2facs.est.1c05451&partnerID=40&md5=f97ab7beafbc742a9bdb0228f8f7ca2e
Agriculture (Switzerland),"Soybean is an important and valuable crop for global food and feed supply, providing high-quality nutrition. Globally, five countries—namely Brazil, the USA, Argentina, China and India—have dominated soybean production for many years. The intention of this paper is to review the reasons for their dominance, starting with seeds. High-quality seeds enable stress-free, high-density and even planting of soybean in the field. Seed quality assurance is essential for the successful expansion of soybean cultivation. The aim of this review is to compare and contrast the factors impacting soybean seed production in these top five soybean-producing countries, including the situations at different stages of the supply chain; research and development on new soybean varieties; and regulations, rules and quality assurance systems (seed testing, certification and labeling). Since the soybean supply chain involves many different operating parties, principles and practices, efforts on different fronts need to be well coordinated by a central authority to ensure successful production. Recently, China has implemented a revised national “Seed Law”. The possible impacts of this new legal framework on soybean seed development and trading in China are also discussed. The strengthened China Seed law to protect resources and encourage variety innovation, as well as the clearer China GM soybean commercial release policy, implies future soybean cultivation expansion with elite varieties. A continuous global production increase will require every party’s compliance to the sustainability principles.","Chen S.-P.J., Li M.-W., Wong H.-Y., Wong F.-L., Wu T., Gai J., Han T., Lam H.-M.",The Seed Quality Assurance Regulations and Certification System in Soybean Production—A Chinese and International Perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129737679&doi=10.3390%2fagriculture12050624&partnerID=40&md5=794def07e88c2939b9e3c384d921a3a6
International Journal of Business Performance and Supply Chain Modelling,"Stakeholders in an agri-food supply chain (AFSC) have responsibility to embrace sustainability as a yardstick to measure their business operations. System-based thinking for an AFSC is essential to harmonise interest of each parties while identifying and evaluating various critical success factors (CSFs) considering stakeholder's view in a sustainability perspective. This study examines relevant critical variables statistically tested for reliability and consistency for implementing system wide sustainability in AFSC. The total interpretative structural modelling (TISM) digraph is derived from the inter-relationship of the variables and the matrix multiplication applied to classification analysis (MICMAC) technique is used to priorities the CSFs based on the potency of their driving and dependence linkages. The developed model offers discussion, analysis and managerial implication in the light of stakeholder-oriented management within the overall paradigm of system sustainability. The study establishes that the government's role is the most important critical variable which conditions the whole system by offering guiding principles to all stakeholders for policy advancement and effective implementation.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"Start-ups are an increasingly important phenomenon in the Brazilian business ecosystem. Many such companies have been created over the past few years, illustrating the interest in and growth of such entrepreneurship. Emerging companies are more likely to be founded on sustainable business models. In many cases, such models incorporate the principles of the circular economy. Thus, this study reviewed the use of disruptive innovation and the circularity of resources in the business models of start-ups. The study consisted of 50 semistructured interviews with start-up owners and managers. We accessed the database of the Brazilian Start-ups Association to map the organisations to be surveyed. Our results show that start-ups are innovating in terms of the circularity of resources through a range of partially implemented initiatives. These initiatives allow start-ups to manage their data and microdata, create artefact integration systems, generate connectivity, accelerate digitisation, stimulate partnerships and cooperation between parties in the supply chain, generate new market opportunities and develop efficient transition systems for the circularity of resources. Thus, there is ample evidence that disruptive innovation supports the circular economy in Brazilian start-ups. This study makes two main contributions to the literature. First, it strengthens the existing understanding of the use of the circular economy in start-ups, supported by disruptive innovation. Second, it identifies the levels of adoption of the circular economy in different market segments. Based on these findings, it identifies several opportunities to encourage further advances in this area.","Sehnem S., Provensi T., da Silva T.H.H., Pereira S.C.F.",Disruptive innovation and circularity in start-ups: A path to sustainable development,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121747349&doi=10.1002%2fbse.2955&partnerID=40&md5=15a6ced12dcb779cd88506f8a5275449
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Starvation and food insecurity are on an upward trajectory as the world population and food prices increase. Food insecurity continues to create life-threatening health concerns while a significant amount of food is wasted due to the ineffective management of food supply chains including inappropriate storage and transportation activities. To save surplus food, reduce food waste, and improve food security, this paper presents a multi-objective, multi-period, and multi-product mathematical model for a non-profit food bank supply chain considering cold chain transportation and storage facilities, heterogeneous fleet, and time limitations. In this research for the first time a three-objective two-stage stochastic program is developed in the non-profit food bank supply chain including 1) minimizing costs of food collection, storage, distribution or transportation, and food banks establishment, 2) minimizing carbon emissions of food waste and transportation as well as incrementing carbon emissions saving through preserving surplus food and 3) optimizing social performance including demand satisfaction, job creation, and unpleasant odor of food waste. Two solution approaches, namely NSGA-II and augmented ε-constraint are employed and compared for small, medium, and large-scale problems. The parameters of the meta-heuristic algorithm are tuned using the Taguchi approach. Then the proposed model is utilized to tackle a real-life case study and the results indicate its efficiency. In addition, the results reveal that applying a heterogeneous fleet is necessary to reduce food waste and transportation costs where cold chain transportation and refrigerated fleets have significantly had direct and positive effects on demand satisfaction and food waste rate.","Kaviyani-Charati M., Ameli M., Heidarzadeh Souraki F., Jabbarzadeh A.",Sustainable network design for a non-profit food bank supply chain with a heterogeneous fleet under uncertainty,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134611241&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2022.108442&partnerID=40&md5=f948f9ea8245d8acd72796494af334d3
Research on Crops,"Straw mushroom turns out to be the leading commodities in Karawang Regency in Indonesia. This district has been called as the highest production district/city in West Java besides West Bandung, Bogor, Subang and Cianjur. The demand for straw mushrooms is always increasing every year. However, still, there are some risks in mushroom supply chain. This study aims at identifying the actors involved and recognizing the types of risks in the straw mushroom supply chain. The respondents used in this study are experts consisting of government representatives, academic representatives, and practitioners involved in the mushroom supply chain. The research method used is descriptive method with survey research techniques. The data used are primary and secondary data. The sample was determined by purposive sampling with consideration of expertise. The analytical method used is Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model; it is used to identify the types of risks in the straw mushroom supply chain. The results demonstrated that there were five actors involved in the six supply chain channel patterns covering farmers, dealers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. The AHP model indicates that production risk (16.3%) is the major risk and needs more attention, and then followed by price risk (14.4%), quality risk (12.3%), capital risk (10.3%) and market risk (10.1%).","Suhaeni, Wulandari Y.S., Umaidah Y., Sumekar Y.","Supply chain risk identification for improving sustainability of straw mushroom in Karawang Regency, Indonesia",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139029616&doi=10.31830%2f2348-7542.2022.ROC-841&partnerID=40&md5=8474a20cadbfd29eaa9f890324f4a48e
Computers and Industrial Engineering,Supplier selection and order allocation (SSOA) is an emerging and important issue in supply chain management. SSOA activities can be utilized to mitigate and manage carbon emissions for organizations. SSOA decisions that explicitly consider carbon neutrality or net-zero emissions within the sourcing process are lacking in the literature. This paper introduces a foundational multi-objective mathematical model to bridge this research gap. The model is empirically applied and evaluated using case study information from an energy trading platform that allows for the joint selection of a portfolio of suppliers. Various sourcing policies are evaluated using a reformulation of the foundational model. Parametric analyses provide additional theoretical and practical insights. Findings include the buyer only seeking fossil fuel purchases or virtually ignoring renewable energy usage—reaching net-zero through the purchase of carbon offsets and end-of-pipe carbon emissions sequestration. These and other findings provide theoretical and managerial insights. Additional opportunities for future investigation are relatively extensive for this socio-environmentally crucial issue. Future research guidance on carbon neutrality and net-zero implications for SSOA is provided in this paper.,"Bai C., Zhu Q., Sarkis J.",Supplier portfolio selection and order allocation under carbon neutrality: Introducing a “Cool”ing model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132741563&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2022.108335&partnerID=40&md5=148dc9d0204166646227063e0c3d94c5
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Supplier selection constitutes a crucial component of manufacturing procurement. We developed a product life cycle cost (PLCC) model to support Taiwanese light-emitting diode (LED) manufacturers in capacity planning for sustainable and resilient supply chain (SC) man-agement. For firms, supply chain PLCC (SCPLCC) is a key consideration, but relevant evidence is scarce. We applied two types of goal programming, namely multiobjective linear programming and revised multichoice goal programming (RMCGP), to develop a PLCC-based model that minimizes net costs, rejections, and late deliveries. Moreover, we constructed a decision-making tool for application to a case of SC sustainable procurement management in a high-tech Taiwanese LED company. Managers can resolve relevant problems by employing the two approaches of the SCPLCC model with various parameters. The implementation of RMCGP with weighted linear goal programming sensitivity analysis produced sufficient findings, according to a study of five models for practical implications. The primary findings of the current model assist business decision-makers in minimizing PLCC, reducing PLCC cost, minimizing net cost, number of rejections, number of late deliveries, achieving PLCC goals, and selecting the best supplier in the context of sustainable SC development.","Tao Y.-J., Lin Y.-S., Lee H.-S., Gan G.-Y., Tu C.-S.","Using a Product Life Cycle Cost Model to Solve Supplier Selection Problems in a Sustainable, Resilient Supply Chain",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125071764&doi=10.3390%2fsu14042423&partnerID=40&md5=4f58fc2558b838d530140f42448cbf66
Operations Management Research,"Supplier selection in food supply chains (FSCs) is not much explored due to the inherent difficulties, complexities and nature of food industry. Food security and quality are top row topics in today’s world health scenario. During sudden food crisis, it needs extra attention where producers, suppliers, and stakeholders play the most vital roles. This paper puts forward a two-phase sustainable multi-tier supplier selection model for FSC based on an integrated decision analysis under multi-criteria perspectives considering sustainability criteria, suppliers and sub-suppliers. In the first phase, the model estimates supplier selection criteria weights using a combined version of step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and level based weight assessment (LBWA) in conjunction with D-numbers. In the second phase, Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the COmpromise Solution (MARCOS)-D method is applied to obtain a ranking pre-order of different tier suppliers. Moreover, several sensitivity analyses are carried out in order to examine model reliability.

Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Supplier training to develop and improve supplier capabilities to meet the needs of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) is necessary for supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. In the absence of any comprehensive model for supplier training need assessment and measurement, in this paper, we first propose a supplier training model and then use the internationally accepted framework of MMOG/LE (Materials Management Operations Guidelines/Logistics Evaluation) to identify the supplier training needs and to design a supplier training curriculum for an OEM in the Chinese automobile industry. Then we adopt the MMOG/LE standards to assess the effectiveness of the proposed supplier training curriculum to improve the perceptions of supplier capabilities related to production and logistics management including sustainability and risk management topics. We found that supplier capabilities perceptions of the purchasing department of the OEM, average supplier capability scores, and the pass rates on the MMOG/LE standard test increased after the completion of the supplier training. Based on these findings, we conclude that supplier training can be used to improve supplier's capability to meet the needs of the OEMs in improving their performance while contributing to the success of their suppliers at the same time. Thus, our proposed supplier training model development and effectiveness assessment framework can be supplemented with some existing analytical approaches to improve buyer–supplier relationship and enhance the profitability of each partner in a supply chain.","Yu V.F., Qiu M., Gupta J.N.D.",Improving supplier capability through training: Evidence from the Chinese Automobile Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122044247&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2021.107825&partnerID=40&md5=41d24368d1d817c106d1b9798f6bf9fc
Cleaner Materials,"Suppliers play an important role in achieving an organization's sustainability goals. By engaging sustainable suppliers, an organization gets clean and green materials to ensure that their end-products are environmentally friendly. Sustainable supplier selection is a challenging task as it involves a complex decision making process involving different objectives and organization priorities. We propose a combined AHP-TOPSIS multiple criteria decision-making approach to solve this problem considering the uncertainty involved and to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative data. In this research, ethics is taken as the fourth dimension of sustainability along with Triple Bottom Line, considering that ethics plays a crucial role in purchasing activity and supplier selection. These four dimensions for sustainable supplier selection criteria have been divided into 16 sub-criteria to evaluate the suppliers. The model is demonstrated by its application to select a sustainable supplier in a real world electronics case company. The results indicate that economic factors still dominate during sustainable supplier selection. In selecting a sustainable supplier, it is found that prominence is given to human rights, safety systems and occupational health, pollution control and resource reduction and consumption, code of conduct, and transparency in suppliers' business and accounting criteria, which covers the other dimensions of sustainability. The application of the proposed model demonstrates the evaluation of tangible and intangible sustainability criteria in selecting a supplier. The result provides a ranking for the suppliers by showing their distances from the positive ideal solution of a sustainable supplier.","Menon R.R., Ravi V.",Using AHP-TOPSIS methodologies in the selection of sustainable suppliers in an electronics supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136505693&doi=10.1016%2fj.clema.2022.100130&partnerID=40&md5=223e4b172a54095bd2b506ad1a6c19a2
Journal of Cleaner Production,"Supply Chain (SC) coordination, quality requirements, and environmental issues are the main areas of interest within the field of inventory management. Few studies have integrated these concepts into an inventory problem despite its overwhelming necessity. In this direction, this paper deals with a vendor-buyer SC under the Vendor-Managed Inventory with Consignment Stock (VMI-CS) agreement. According to the agreement, the vendor bears the buyer's financial holding cost in return for the storage of products in the buyer's warehouse. Further, each shipment involves a random fraction of repairable items, which need to be withdrawn from the inventory system. Unlike the existing literature, when repair policy is evaluated not to be profitable, these items can either be salvaged or scrapped in the present problem. In other words, this study aims at providing a decision support model to find the optimal withdrawal policy as a joint quality and lot-sizing policy. To fulfill sustainability criteria, carbon emissions are incorporated into the total cost of SC by considering carbon tax and cap-and-trade regulation. The optimum solution is found through an analytical algorithm. Finally, a numerical study is conducted to illustrate the applicability of the models and gain managerial insights. The results show that the performance of VMI-CS for all withdrawal policies is superior to traditional mechanism, but its cost-saving sharing has to improve. In addition, the sensitivity analyzes reveal that the fraction of imperfect items greatly affects the optimal withdrawal policy. Finally, adopting carbon regulations does not seriously affect the optimal withdrawal policy and inventory decisions but causes a relatively much increase in the total cost.","Asadkhani J., Fallahi A., Mokhtari H.",A sustainable supply chain under VMI-CS agreement with withdrawal policies for imperfect items,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138998604&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.134098&partnerID=40&md5=94b1a15b0319070e47b8e90ce184aa82
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Supply chain management (SCM) plays an important role in international work distribution mechanisms. This phenomenon has shifted to an SCM-to-SCM competition rather than corporate-to-corporate competition in the global market. Apple and Samsung Electronics are the two major global information and communications technology (ICT) companies, each choosing different SCM strategies to stabilize production while minimizing inventory and maintaining ongoing partnerships with suppliers. To analyze the relationship between strategic differences in SCM structure of the ICT companies and capital, while employing the generalized method of moments, this study analyzed partnerships with suppliers from a financial perspective for long-term growth and stable production. Results identified that the target debt ratio of Apple’s parts suppliers was 38%, which was slightly higher than that of US companies (33%). In the relationship between capital structure and SCM structures, the company’s debt ratio decreases if the strength of the strategic alliance and the strength of the horizontal integration of global parts suppliers are higher. Specifically, Apple’s parts suppliers with non-equity alliances, such as technological and R&D alliances, have reduced debt ratios more than companies with equity alliances. In the case of Samsung Electronics’ parts suppliers, primary vendors had a lower debt ratio than secondary vendors. These results indicates that if the strength of the vertical integration with the international strategic alliances is greater, they are more likely to adopt a lower debt ratio policy.

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Supply chain management has been mutated to adapt to the developments over the last couple of decades. Smart paradigms, one of today's most significant paradigm shifts, occur in almost every moment of our daily lives. On the other hand, the importance of sustainability has increased more and more, reducing available resources of our world and increasing the effect of climate change and environmental degradation. In this context, this study it is aimed to develop a strategy for the supplier selection process by investigating the impacts of using different fuzzy environments and different decision-making methods on smart and sustainable supplier selection. The applicability of the proposed approaches has been demonstrated by a supplier selection case study of Company V, an automobile spare parts manufacturer. With the comparative analyzes made, it has been observed that although different fuzzy environments or varying decision-making methods in supplier selection create minor differences in criterion weights, it does not make any difference in supplier evaluations. For this reason, it has been concluded that it does not affect supplier selection. In addition, it was investigated how different supplier distributions in the strategies developed with the scenario analyzes affected each purpose of Company V, and an increase was observed in purchasing costs, carbon emission rates, quality rates, and on-time delivery rates when their importance levels increased from sustainable to smart criteria.

Case Studies on Transport Policy,"Supply chain management in urban centers has been receiving increasing attention. The reason is that freight transport efficiency has improved in recent times and has contributed to regions' economic and social development. Thus, new urban mobility initiatives have been developing to deliver merchandise efficiently, which reduce last-mile deliveries costs and negative externalities to the environment. In the case of Latin-American cities, freight transport faces problems like poor infrastructure and little investment in innovative technologies that can help improve deliveries. In this sense, cargo bicycles and tricycles have emerged as profitable alternatives for making last-mile deliveries more efficient in urban centers. These modes represent a low investment in vehicles that are versatile for moving through densely populated cities and have a low environmental impact. At the same time, this alternative brings economic benefits for both companies and freight carriers. The current research reports the study and analyses of survey data collected by the authors to discuss last-mile deliveries using cargo bikes. To do so, the authors interviewed, on the one hand, the directors of cargo bike companies, and, on the other hand, they conducted surveys to carriers who work in last-mile deliveries to and from commercial establishments in the study area. The case study is Medellin, Colombia, a developing Latin American city with high slopes on its roads due to its mountainous topography, a condition that impacts cargo transportation by bicycle. The empirical results obtained serve as a basis for the case study to identify critical issues in bicycle last-mile deliveries and planning in cities with similar socio-economic and topographical conditions. These enable assessment of topographic characteristics, road safety, profiles of the couriers, and merchandise properties to optimize the use and benefits of cargo bikes in developing cities.","Gonzalez-Calderon C.A., Posada-Henao J.J., Granada-Muñoz C.A., Moreno-Palacio D.P., Arcila-Mena G.","Cargo bicycles as an alternative to make sustainable last-mile deliveries in Medellin, Colombia",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132601593&doi=10.1016%2fj.cstp.2022.04.006&partnerID=40&md5=a9e51a455a2501a73ef9b2b9d3e4442e
AIP Conference Proceedings,"Supply chain management is an integral part of most businesses because it could affect the sustainability of a business and the customer's satisfaction. Various computerized SCM system have been proposed in order to built an effective and efficient supply chain management system. However, these existing systems are based on centralized architecture and could not fully integrate the supply chain data from its members. Furthermore, a centralized system architecture has a higher risk to suffer from single-point-of-failure issue. In this paper, a secure blockchain-based SCM framework is proposed. The proposed SCM framework adopts a data verification mechanism through the use of a unique shipment security token. The shipment security token is distributed via 2 channels: the physical and digital token distribution channel. The 2 channels token verification method secures the data stored in the blockchain ledger and makes it easy to trace the product data in the blockchain network.

Advances of Artificial Intelligence in a Green Energy Environment,"Supply chain management is the basis for the execution of operations, being considered as the core of the business function in the 21st century. On the other hand, at present, factors such as the reduction of natural resources, the search for competitive advantages, government laws, and global agreements have generated a greater interest in the sustainable development, which, in order to achieve it, industries need to rethink and plan their supply chain considering a path of sustainability. So sustainable supply chain management emerges as a means to integrate stakeholders' concern for profit and cost reduction with environmental and social requirements, attracting significant interest among managers, researchers, and practitioners. The main objective of this study is to provide a synthesis of the key elements of the quantitative model offerings that use sustainability indicators in the design and management of forward supply chains. To achieve this objective, we developed a systematic literature review that includes 80 articles published during the last decade in peer-reviewed journals in English language. In addition, a 4W's analysis (when, who, what, and where) is applied and three structural dimensions are defined and grouped by categories: supply chain management, modeling, and sustainability.

Gazi University Journal of Science,"Supply Chain Management plays an important role in the success and performance of businesses. Supply chains have to adapt to changes in technological advancements and customer expectations to maintain competitive advantage. On the other hand, driving factors such as risk reduction, increasing the financial performance of the supply chain, societal influence, governmental requirements and attracting customers who give importance to sustainability have been influential in the increasing interest in the concept of Sustainable Supply Chain. Therefore, businesses maintain their supply chain operations while focusing on economic, environmental and social dimensions. Additionally, the risk evaluation methods employed in supply chain management are considered to be more qualitative rather than quantitative. This study conducted in a Turkish defense industry company introduces a quantitative framework that allows the evaluation of risks and risk management practices required for sustainable supplier performance with the help of a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach. In this study, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Rating Methods are applied together in order to evaluate risks through classification of critical suppliers with respect to business volume, capabilities and schedule certainty. Using this framework, Sustainable Supplier Risk Scores (SSRS) of each class of suppliers have been calculated and specific risk management practices have been determined for each class. The objective is to establish effective supply chain risk management practices, which provide long term partnership with suppliers in a business with strategic customers, high cost of production, high expectations in terms of quality and high level of supply chain risks.","Kabak M., Oztek G.",A Multi-Criteria Approach to Sustainable Risk Management of Supplier Portfolio: A Case Study at Defense Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139494682&doi=10.35378%2fgujs.883894&partnerID=40&md5=381152be63c25e774fe0e91d8c0690b4
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Supply chain network design (SCND) is a pillar of supply chain management (SCM). The modern industrial and market context, characterized by instability and dynamism, asks the supply chains and logistic networks to be designed from an integrated and reactive perspective, addressing multiple goals. Economic and environmental sustainability is the most explored target by the literature. Besides this goal, the recent mass customization paradigm, led by Industry 4.0, resulted in a significant growth of product variants, which cannot be managed by traditional production strategies, as Make-to-Stock (MTS), because of the high rising costs. Hence, stock minimization, which is one of the main pillars of the lean production philosophy, is a key competitive asset to consider in SCND. However, the current literature still lacks of integrated three-objective models simultaneously optimizing stock, economic and environmental issues in designing and managing modern supply chain networks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes and applies a mid-term three-objective linear programming optimization model to minimize, simultaneously, the stock level (lean waste), the environmental emissions (green waste), and the global supply chain network costs, getting the Pareto frontier and supporting the industrial practitioners and the logistic managers in the network design and management. A European instance exemplifies the model application getting stock, environmental and economic optima together with reasonable best-balance configurations. Among the Pareto points, the selected configuration allows reducing the stock level without a relevant increase of the environmental emissions (+1.62%) and of the supply chain network costs (+0.21%), respect to their single-objective optima.","Bortolini M., Calabrese F., Galizia F.G., Mora C.",A three-objective optimization model for mid-term sustainable supply chain network design,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127529471&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2022.108131&partnerID=40&md5=317034bb1701c21717929bbbdd268d85

This study explores the relationships among control mechanisms (process, social, and outcome control), SCRES (proactive and reactive resilience), and sustainability performance (economic, environmental, and social performance). Structural equation modeling is used to analyze data collected from 322 Chinese manufacturing firms. This study finds that process control and social control have a positive impact on the two dimensions of SCRES, while outcome control has no significant impact on SCRES. Proactive and reactive resilience both have a significant positive impact on the three dimensions of sustainability performance.

Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"Supply chain security and resilience represent the key aspects of the long-term sustainability and well-being of current societies. The ability of global supply chains to be resilient and flexible has to face a wide range of threats, uncertainties, and sudden shifts in case the time and necessary resources for the adequate reaction are limited. Challenges affecting supply chains, which companies have to deal with, result from a changeable environment and threats in the form of sudden demand shifts as well as unavailability of necessary resources caused by security threats. A conceptual model based on a modified CPM method was created on the basis of the scientific literature review research, focusing on available open sources and data, and subsequently applied to the further development of global distribution chains, logistics infrastructure, and availability of logistics capabilities.

Drones,"Supply chain solutions are based on first-mile and last-mile deliveries; their efficiency significantly influences the total cost of operation. Drone technologies make it possible to improve first-mile and last-mile operations, but the design and optimization of these solutions offers new challenges. Within the frame of this article, the author focuses on the impact of integrated first-mile/last-mile drone-based delivery services from trucks, analyzing the impact of solutions on energy efficiency, the environmental impact and sustainability. The author describes a novel model of drone-based integrated first-mile/last-mile services which makes it possible to analyze the impact of different typical solutions on sustainability. As the numerical examples and computational results show, the integrated first-mile-last-mile drone-based service from trucks could lead to a significant reduction in energy consumption and a reduction in virtual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which would lead to a more sustainable logistics system. The numerical analysis of the scenarios shows that the increased application of drones and the integration of first-mile and last-mile delivery operations could decrease energy consumption by about 87%.

Mathematical Problems in Engineering,"Supply chain sustainability as a new and very effective approach has recently attracted the attention of researchers in the field of supply chain management. Also, a circular economy helps to reduce the waste materials and products in a supply chain. In order to include circular economy in supply chain network design, it is necessary to use the concept of closed-loop network design. Therefore, designing a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network that works well even by changing some parameters seems to be necessary. This paper presents a multiproduct, sustainable closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty. First, a mathematical model is proposed to design a closed-loop network, and then a set of possible scenarios is used to deal with the uncertainty of the parameters. In order to show the validity and applicability of the proposed model, numerical examples are presented and analyzed. In this regard, numerical results show the appropriate performance of the proposed model. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the role of customer demand in different aspects of sustainability. It is revealed that increasing customer demand will have a strong impact on economic and environmental objectives.","Zhang Y., Wang Y., Yadav B.K.",Application of Circular Economy and Uncertainty Planning in Analyzing the Sustainable Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Design,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125473050&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f5320974&partnerID=40&md5=d3cf71c05510d73a1bbb9847034ce690
IEEE Access,"Supply chain sustainability assessment is key to maintaining and improving the performance of agroindustry supply chains, particularly in sustainable agroindustry development. The assessment of agro-industrial supply chain performance is a complex and dynamic process. Hence, there is a need for an adaptive fuzzy multi-criteria sustainability assessment model as an alternative method of analysis and improvement. This study aimed to design an adaptive fuzzy multi-criteria sustainability assessment and improvement model for the sugarcane agroindustry supply chain. In this study: (1) a fuzzy inference system (FIS) was developed to assess the performance of the sustainability dimensions. This study proposed 24 indicators for four dimensions: Economic, social, environmental, and resource. (2) An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is designed to aggregate the overall supply chain sustainability performance. (3) The proposed fuzzy multi-criteria assessment model was compared with the common multidimensional scaling (MDS) and linear models. This study proved that the proposed synthesis of the FIS and ANFIS models is powerful and adaptive for evaluating supply chain sustainability and providing accurate results. (4) The strategies to improve sustainability performance were developed using the cosine amplitude method (CAM). The proposed model determined that the overall supply chain sustainability value was 68.58%, which was almost sustainable. Several strategies have been suggested to improve sustainability performance, including maintaining the sugarcane supply by strengthening the partnership program and improving the mill's overall recovery, followed by factory revitalization or new factory investment.","Yani M., MacHfud, Asrol M., Hambali E., Papilo P., Mursidah S., Marimin M.",An Adaptive Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Model for Sustainability Assessment of Sugarcane Agroindustry Supply Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122568841&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2022.3140519&partnerID=40&md5=9cc5a9f134da7daca388aa0f936c9ea6

However, there is no standard for measuring supply chain sustainability and business competitiveness. The objectives of this research were to analyze and criticize existing methods for supply chain sustainability assessment and develop a new framework for future research. This study reviewed 151 scientific articles related to supply chain sustainability assessments from 2004 to 2020. The results show that many techniques are used for sustainability assessments. However, no single technique can comprehensively measure supply chain sustainability. Therefore, a new robust technique that accommodates complex data in a sustainable supply chain is required. The technique to be developed is a machine learning technique because it can accommodate multi-criteria problems with various nonlinear relationships. This research is a case study of the sugarcane agroindustry supply chain. The supply chain of the sugarcane agroindustry faces various sustainability issues caused by negative environmental impacts. The analysis results show that using machine learning techniques to assess sustainability for the sugarcane agroindustry's supply chain has great potential to be developed.

Mathematics,"Supply chain sustainability, which takes environmental, economic, and social factors into account, was recently recognized as a critical component of the supply chain (SC) management evaluation process and known as a multi-criteria decision-making problem (MCDM) that is heavily influenced by the decision-makers. While some criteria can be analyzed numerically, a large number of qualitative criteria require expert review in linguistic terms. This study proposes an integration of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), spherical fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (SF-AHP), and spherical fuzzy weighted aggregated sum product assessment (SF-WASPAS) to identify a sustainable supplier for the steel manufacturing industry in Vietnam. In this study, both quantitative and qualitative factors are considered through a comprehensive literature review and expert interviews. The first step employs DEA to validate high-efficiency suppliers based on a variety of quantifiable criteria. The second step evaluates these suppliers further on qualitative criteria, such as economic, environmental, and social factors. The SF-AHP was applied to obtain the criteria’s significance, whereas the SF-WASPAS was adopted to identify sustainable suppliers. The sensitivity analysis and comparative results demonstrate that the decision framework is feasible and robust. The findings of this study can assist steel industry executives in resolving the macrolevel supplier selection problem. Moreover, the proposed method can assist managers in selecting and evaluating suppliers more successfully in other industries.","Nguyen T.-L., Nguyen P.-H., Pham H.-A., Nguyen T.-G., Nguyen D.-T., Tran T.-H., Le H.-C., Phung H.-T.",A Novel Integrating Data Envelopment Analysis and Spherical Fuzzy MCDM Approach for Sustainable Supplier Selection in Steel Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131841402&doi=10.3390%2fmath10111897&partnerID=40&md5=2e58c8999bd3eb0549eeb8246976945f
Management Review Quarterly,"Supply chain transparency and its connection to sustainability is a current topic in supply chain management research. The term supply chain transparency is used very loosely in this discourse. Therefore, this article aims to clarify the understanding of supply chain transparency in the context of sustainability to enable future research. In a content analysis-based literature review, 92 peer-reviewed articles were identified in the intersection of sustainability, supply chains, and transparency. Only 30 articles contained a definition of transparency. Supply chain transparency was used and defined very differently among the researchers. By providing a general definition and framework of sustainable supply chain transparency, the term “supply chain transparency” gains more clarity. Three dimensions of transparency were identified: sustainable supply chain information, involved stakeholders, and perspective. The supply chain transparency research was conducted primarily in the context of the food and apparel industry. Transparency was characterized differently among the industries and was studied with different foci. Furthermore, the review revealed a focus of supply chain transparency research on the social dimension of sustainability. Additionally, a wide range of topics on supply chain transparency has been covered in the existing literature, and opportunities for future research are outlined.

To ensure sustainability and resilience in face of the problems that arise in globalizing supply chains, it is becoming an important issue today; a supply chain must be flexible, agile and responsive. Therefore, the aim of the study is to focus on resilience in sustainable global supply chains (GSC) to avoid disruptions caused by pandemics such as COVID-19; it is also conducted research on responsiveness of sustainable global supply chains during COVID-19. In this study, dynamic capability perspective and contingency theory are used to conceptualize theoretical models for COVID-19. Moreover, a partial least squares (PLS) model is used to analyse the research hypotheses with 200 responses collected from companies which have complex supply chain structures. As a novel result, the relationship between flexibility, agility and responsiveness of global supply chain is revealed. Supply chain agility is found to be directly affected by supply chain flexibility.

Chemical Engineering Transactions,"Supply chains in Creole-Antillean avocado production are not highly efficient in Colombia and large quantities of this product are wasted due to fruit deterioration. There, it is important to identify alternatives of waste valorization such as avocado oil production. To assess the viability of large-scale avocado oil production from a sustainability point of view, related to the quality of energy conservation, decision-making tools such as exergy analysis must be applied. In this work, an exergy analysis was carried out to identify sources of irreversibilities within the large-scale production of such oil. The conversion of avocado pulp into oil was simulated through the software Aspen plus ® to obtain the extended mass and energy balances. The chemical and physical exergies were quantified and used to calculate the global exergetic efficiency as well as the efficiency by stages of the process. From this analysis, it was found that the stage with the highest waste exergy corresponds to the centrifugation stage. Likewise, it is possible to observe that the greatest irreversibilities in the process occur in the solvent distillation, condensation, and cooling stage 2,754.49 MJ/h. The peel and seed separation showed an exergetic efficiency of 99.0 %, while the overall exergy of the process obtained was 26.80 %.

One Earth,"Supply chains of agricultural commodities, such as banana, cocoa, coffee, and tea, are vulnerable to climate change. Their ability to adapt depends on assessments of climate change impacts on producing regions. Such assessments are, however, missing despite available climate projections. Here, we analyze how drought, heat stress, and heavy precipitation could affect over 1.6 million producers within the Fairtrade supply chain by 2050 by using projections from general circulation models. Globally, Fairtrade producers will mainly be subject to increased heat stress. Drought might present particular pressures on Brazilian and Central American coffee producers and on tea producers in southeastern Africa. Heavy precipitation might become more common for producers of cocoa and coffee in the Andes, coffee producers in East Africa, and tea producers in South Asia. Our approach enables the identification of how sensitive different regions are to climate change, allowing for timely adaptation.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Supply Networks (SN) can be seriously affected by unplanned disruptions producing important consequences on system's functioning. These alterations may have implications over dimensions of sustainability due to the re-adaptation of the network to cope with the disruptive event. In this sense, it is relevant to understand how sustainability can be measured while considering aspects like resilience and network's dynamism. This article presents a critical review to enhance the understanding of sustainability assessment of supply networks affected by disruptions under a CAS perspective. A non-systematic literature search was conducted where relevant studies were identified. The dissociation between sustainability and resilience observed in literature was discussed from motivational, temporal and methodological perspectives. The review led to the proposition of four principles that underpin the conceptual foundations that should guide the development of any complexity-driven sustainability assessment methodology (SAM). Moreover, using agent-based modelling as the core computational paradigm, a SAM framework was outlined as a first step to implement a functioning tool that embeds the new assessment approach. Finally, the article concludes that sustainability should adopt a complexity-oriented approach when analysing disruptions.

Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,"Sustainability and resilience in Agri-Food Supply Chains is a challenging topic of current interest in the research community. Resilience for Agri-Food Supply Chain (AFSC) is the capability of the supply network to manage and mitigate disruptions due to global warming and natural phenomena such as landslides and floods of crops, among others caused by humans. A significant challenge is to design efficient and resilient AFSCs in emerging countries while perishability constraints are considered. A methodology to design an AFSC for emerging countries is addressed in this research. The phenomena that aid in identifying critical aspects of the AFSC affecting their resilience are identified. The former approach combines optimization and simulation schemes by considering resilience metrics related to availability and connectivity. Indeed, the solution approach addresses the uncertainty by using simulation of disruptive events and finding resilient designs using mathematical programming. The proposed framework has been evaluated in a Colombian coffee supply chain. The obtained results show the efficiency of the proposed scheme to design AFSCs and allow the practitioners to measure, predict, compare, and improve the level of resilience of their supply chains (SCs).","Clavijo-Buritica N., Triana-Sanchez L., Escobar J.W.",A hybrid modeling approach for resilient agri-supply network design in emerging countries: Colombian coffee supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139334757&doi=10.1016%2fj.seps.2022.101431&partnerID=40&md5=243d855330ec416b69cb763bbcef9d7c
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Sustainability awareness across various economic sectors requires firms to use logistics outsourcing to reduce logistics-related emissions with compliant logistics service providers (LSPs). LSPs apply advanced information technologies to help achieve high efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability goals. While logistics outsourcing has received considerable attention from researchers, limited research has identified the elements of logistics outsourcing and established research trends regarding technology and sustainability aspects of logistics outsourcing. This study aims to establish trends in technology and sustainability in logistics outsourcing and identify the important elements of logistics outsourcing. A bibliometric analysis technique using the Biblioshiny package in R. A SCOPUS search resulted in 2019 documents. Research on technology and sustainability in logistics outsourcing is growing, especially in developed countries, with little or no research from developing countries. Sustainable supply chains and third-party logistics themes dominated the past research. Current research is on reverse logistics, circular economy, and green logistics; the latter is likely to dominate the future, focusing on risk management, pollution control, and innovation through advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data. Essential elements of logistics outsourcing are identified as maintaining a good relationship based on trust and cooperation, LSP multi-selection criteria that include sustainability and technology capabilities, proper contract management, and an appropriate in-house versus outsourcing balance for competitiveness. LSP managers are advised to develop sustainability and technology capabilities, including reverse logistics.

Sustainable Development,"Sustainability engagement is suggested to increase future company value. Collaboration between companies can assist them to become more sustainable. Even though collaboration can be seen as instrumental in developing more sustainable companies, the rise of e-business has changed the game in terms of attaining high performance. Thus, this study investigates the relations among supplier collaboration, sustainability, and market performance in the context of e-business. Specifically, the aim of this study is to determine how supplier collaboration leads small e-businesses to develop e-business sustainability and, in turn, deliver enhanced market performance. The data were collected with a cross-sectional random sampling of small online store operators in Finland. Supplier collaboration was found to influence market performance via e-business sustainability. The results offer implications for firms operating in e-business by supporting collaboration with suppliers and sustainability values while maintaining high market performance.","Ukko J., Saunila M., Nasiri M., Rantala T.",The importance of sustainability engagement in small businesses supplier collaboration,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108970796&doi=10.1002%2fsd.2224&partnerID=40&md5=8fcc695ab028b1d91970cbcf379be832
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Sustainability has a well-established influence on innovation, but less scrutiny about the efficacy of sustainable supply chain integration as a determinant of green innovations has been done. Based on information processing theory and dynamic capability view, this study proposes a framework relating sustainable supply chain integration, green innovation, and firm performance. Primary survey data and secondary data of annual reports published by 296 manufacturing firms from 19 different sectors in Pakistan were collected, and structural equation modeling (AMOS 26 and SPSS 25) was employed. Results indicate that sustainable internal, supplier, and customer integration foster both green managerial and process innovations. Findings also suggest that green managerial innovation has a significant positive influence on the firm's financial performance. In contrast, the influence of green process innovations on firm performance is negatively significant, suggesting that rapid changes in manufacturing processes and operational procedures cost firms in multiple ways and decrease firms’ profits. The new findings have implications for both managers and researchers in managing sustainable supply chains and green innovation.","Junaid M., Zhang Q., Syed M.W.",Effects of sustainable supply chain integration on green innovation and firm performance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121154154&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2021.11.031&partnerID=40&md5=d3f41dc1ccdc801f0b1ab74d6d5289c6
"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Sustainability has become a critical issue in supplier selection problems. Also, risk management in supply chains has become an important issue in supply chain management (SCM). The literature shows that there is no data envelopment analysis (DEA) research to evaluate suppliers by considering both sustainability factors and risk factors. This paper introduces a new concept entitled stability which is a combination of sustainability and risk indices. Due to the importance of assessment of suppliers in SCM, the current study not only develops a new DEA model for solving the voting system but also by employing an ideal candidate proposes a multi-objective DEA model to increase discrimination power using fuzzy efficiency method. Our developed method is applied in a case study to assess the stability of 26 petrochemical companies supplying raw materials to the Homa Rashten Aligodarz Industrial Group. Using the proposed models, the most stable supplier is determined. Moreover, according to the obtained results, the environmental criteria are determined as the most effective criteria on the overall preference ranking, and also, the Managers-based ranking is found as the most effect on the final overall preference ranking. A comparison between the proposed method and existing methods indicates that the presented method provides more reliable results.","Izadikhah M., Farzipoor Saen R., Zare R., Shamsi M., Khanmohammadi Hezaveh M.",Assessing the stability of suppliers using a multi-objective fuzzy voting data envelopment analysis model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129866251&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-022-02376-6&partnerID=40&md5=e709fd96712ee29826418fdaf9f02807
Applied Soft Computing,"Sustainability has become increasingly important over the last three decades and has proven to be a key enabler for constructing resilient supply chains. Customers who want their products to be authenticated for sustainability put pressure on Original Equipment Manufacturers and suppliers to become more sustainable on a global scale. Moreover, social sustainability issues have become more challenging to address, and a growing number of stakeholders put emphasis on societal concerns. To this end, decision-makers are becoming increasingly interested in applying disruptive technologies to address societal, environmental, and economic concerns and accomplish sustainability goals. Researchers argue that disruptive technologies such as blockchain may be implemented to assist supply chains towards building sustainability. However, our literature analysis concluded that existing research has not quantitatively examined the critical functions of sustainable supply chain (SSC) for blockchain applicability using a decision framework. Therefore, this research, through Fuzzy SWARA-COPRAS-EDAS and COPELAND-based framework, is aimed at investigating the most feasible functions of a SSC for potential blockchain implementations. Using this framework, the critical functions of a SSC were ranked against the benefits of blockchain. The findings of this study implied that while sourcing, delivery, transformation and product recovery proved to be the most appropriate functions of SSCs for blockchain applications, customers and product use was the least feasible one. This study aids decision-makers in gaining a more thorough understanding of where in a SSC blockchain may create additional value.","Erol I., Ar I.M., Peker I.",Scrutinizing blockchain applicability in sustainable supply chains through an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision making framework,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122193908&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2021.108331&partnerID=40&md5=60fcb7f943dcc482c47b0b39afd48304
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Sustainability has been enshrined in the official claims of mega sporting events, and scholarly debates persist on how to achieve environmental stewardship and a prolonged legacy. Revitalizing the public transportation system with alternative fuel bus technologies has speculated significant environmental and socio-economic benefits to the host nation. This paper thus attempts to quantify and analyze the environmental, social, and economic impacts of alternative fuel buses throughout their entire life cycle stages to support the thought process of sustainable mobility practices in hosting mega-events. A hybrid, multi-regional Input-Output (MRIO) based life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) model is developed to assess three bus types: compressed natural gas (CNG), electric buses (EBs), and diesel buses (DBs). The results are investigated in terms of a combination of various manufacturing and end-of-life scenarios by encompassing impacts embedded in the global supply chains. A scenario-based analysis is then conducted to assess the impacts and associated benefits of EB compared to alternative bus technologies in host nations, during and post-event, taking the upcoming FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ as a case. The results for the MRIO analysis demonstrate the impacts embedded in the global supply chains and on-site benefits of adopting alternative fuel buses may compromise each other, as impacts might be shifted towards other countries (through manufacturing and end-of-life, in exporting countries) while minimizing the operation phase impacts in the importing country, Qatar. Even though the economic benefits of EBs are higher than the CNG buses, and with almost similar social benefits, the environmental impact of the CNG buses inside the host nation is much less than the DBs. This would thus make CNG buses a more balanced alternative than the DBs and EBs. The outcome of this research stays as an eye-opener to the local organizing committee of mega-events to rethink the current sough alternatives for the use of electric transit with more balanced alternatives as proposed in the study, to achieve the mandated carbon neutrality and environmental footprint mitigation goals.","Elagouz N., Onat N.C., Kucukvar M., Sen B., Kutty A.A., Kagawa S., Nansai K., Kim D.",Rethinking mobility strategies for mega-sporting events: A global multiregional input-output-based hybrid life cycle sustainability assessment of alternative fuel bus technologies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135866440&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.07.031&partnerID=40&md5=37e380292fbc37678379c8ca3776f094
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Sustainability has profound implications for environmental competitiveness, yet little has been done to study the feasibility of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices as a predictor of organizational performance (operational and environmental performance). By integrating stakeholder theory and dynamic capability theory, this study aims to determine the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on SSCM practices and assess its impact on organizational performance. This research also investigates the role of big data analytical capabilities (BDAC) in mediating the relationship between SSCM practices and organizational performance. The authors collected data online, examined 320 valid responses, and tested research hypotheses. The findings suggest that CSR (both internal and external CSR) positively promotes SSCM practices and contributes to expanding dynamic capacity theory in the context of BDA capabilities.

International Journal of Industrial Engineering : Theory Applications and Practice,"Sustainability in supply chains is more important than ever. In this paper, we consider a supply chain with a reverse flow where customers can return or replace products that flow backward to upstream members. The returned products re-enter the forward flow after different adjustments. We focus on measuring how the different operational parameters affect the sustainability of the supply chain and whether their interaction may affect the sustainability measures or not. The sustainability dimensions considered here are the social and environmental dimensions. A system dynamics model is developed for a supply chain with reverse flow. The proposed model measures the social dimension in terms of customer satisfaction and the environmental dimension in terms of the green image factor. We run the model for different parameters, and a factorial analysis is conducted on the results to show their main effect and their interaction effect on the measures under study.

Computational and Applied Mathematics,"Sustainability in the lean supply chain is the consideration of all economic, social and environmental aspects in an integrated system. This study aims to design a novel multi-objective sustainable lean supply chain (LSC) network under uncertainty which all economic, social and environmental aspects are considered. The designed LSC network model incorporates multiple echelons, including retailers, distribution centers, production centers, suppliers, and final customers. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how a robust-fuzzy optimization technique can be used to control uncertainty parameters such as transportation costs, facility capacity, and demand. The deployment of this technique in the design of the LSC network leads to increased reliability in supplying the customer demand. The model’s objective functions are to minimize the total cost of designing LSC networks (economic aspect), to minimize waste in production units (environmental aspect), and to maximize the overall sustainability performance indicator (SPI) (social aspect). To achieve these objectives and to identify the Pareto front, we investigated both exact and meta-heuristic methods. The results indicated that when lean management tools are used in supply chain network conditions, the SPI increases and waste in the production units decreases. Additionally, it increases the cost of network design. Moreover, increasing the effect of uncertainty results in increased demand and decreased capacity in the supply chain network, resulting in an increase in network-related costs. However, the increase in the rate of uncertainty has resulted in an increase in waste in manufacturing units and a decline in the SPI. Finally, it was determined through numerous experiments and statistical tests that meta-heuristics algorithms are more efficient at solving the designed model in less time. As a result, the most efficient solution method was determined to be the MOGWO algorithm.","Ghahremani-Nahr J., Ghaderi A.",Robust-fuzzy optimization approach in design of sustainable lean supply chain network under uncertainty,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134592969&doi=10.1007%2fs40314-022-01936-w&partnerID=40&md5=f1192d612903260556c4423738ed33c6
Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,"Sustainability is a new concept that emerged in many fields in the recent years. Especially in the last few years, sustainability has been among the issues that attracts the attention of the countries, companies and academics. Sustainability is the effective use of resources to meet the present needs of the world in order to avoid problems in meeting the needs of future generations. One of the crucial component of the sustainability in companies is supply chain management. When the 3 dimensions of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) have been taken into consideration in supply chain management, the concept of sustainable supply chain management has emerged. Sustainable Supply Chain Management is the management of flow of information, material and capital along the supply chain among the firms, by taking economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development into account which stem for the expectations of customers and stakeholders. In recent years, companies started to adopt the sustainability principles due to legal obligations, public awareness and activities of non-governmental organizations. Applications within the companies regarding sustainability principles are discussed in detail in their sustainability reports. In the previous studies, researchers have examined the sustainability reports regarding economics concerns or whether they comply with the pre-determined criteria. However, there has been no study about companies’ actions in supply chain management by examining sustainability reports. Therefore, in this study, sustainability reports of the companies which are in BIST (Borsa Istanbul Stock Exchange) Sustainability Index in Turkey were examined and by looking at these reports, their actions about sustainable supply chain management were discussed in detail. In this study, the practices of companies to establish a sustainable supply chain were discussed.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Sustainability is achieved by fulfilling economic, environmental, and social goals. Until recently, social sustainability indicators had not received much attention in the literature. Social sustainability and its indicators are poorly understood, which makes it somewhat difficult to oversee the design and implementation of sustainability projects. This paper responds to this by investigating Social Sustainability Indicators (SSIs) across many sectors to learn how they could potentially apply to the energy sector, with special attention given to classifying those indicators into energy supply chains (ESCs), stakeholder, and impact levels. It does this by critical reviewing 420 social indicators in the literature and proposing a practical set of categories related to the energy sector. The findings show that the majority of SSIs address the “production” and “demand” stages of ESC. SSIs related to employees are also common, based on stakeholder analysis. The analysis highlighted the importance of internal stakeholders, in particular, in achieving social sustainability. The number of SSIs at the strategic level far exceeds those at the tactical and operational levels. There is no consensus on definitions of SSIs, and, subsequently, there is no agreement on their measurement or the data needed for that purpose. Potential SSIs that may conflict with one another are investigated to identify implementation challenges. The contribution of this paper is classifying the SSIs, identifying the gaps, investigating implementation challenges, discussing implications, and proposing future research directions to promote awareness about renewable energy for better progress towards sustainability.","Afshari H., Agnihotri S., Searcy C., Jaber M.Y.",Social sustainability indicators: A comprehensive review with application in the energy sector,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125628476&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.02.018&partnerID=40&md5=4234c24e244a2f1f6adc290c59194cd0

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Sustainability is key factor for transforming traditional supply chain networks into modern ones. This study, for the first time, considers the impacts of the backup suppliers and lateral transshipment/resupply simultaneously on designing a Sustainable Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network (SCLSCN) to decrease the shortage that may occur during the transmission of produced goods in the network. In this manner, the fuzzy multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to design an efficient SCLSCN resiliently. Moreover, the concept of circular economy has been studied in this paper to reduce environmental effects. This study aims to optimize total and environmental costs, including energy consumption and pollution emissions, while increasing job opportunities. A demand uncertainty component is considered to represent reality more closely. Due to the importance of demand, this parameter is estimated using the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) as an input into the proposed mathematical model. Then, the fuzzy robust optimization approach is applied in a fuzzy set’s environment. The model is tackled by a Multi-Choice Goal Programming Approach with Utility Function (MCGP-UF) to be solved in a timely manner, and the equivalent auxiliary crisp model is employed to convert the multi-objective function to a single objective. The proposed model is tested on the case study of the tire industry in terms of costs, environmental impacts, and social effects. The result confirmed that considering the concept of lateral resupply and backup supplier could considerably decrease the total costs and reduce shortages on the designed SCLSCN.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to concentrate its attention on the analysis of the benefits that enabling Industry 4.0 technologies can provide in terms of mitigating the risks in CLSCs, with a specific focus on the operational risks. Through two systematic literature reviews, this paper identifies the main operational risks connected with CLSCs activities and describes the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on mitigating identified risks.

There are several models in the research literature to manage sustainability risks of the supply chain. Considering that critical risks have the highest impact and have the largest share of risk management resources, they need to be identified using special techniques to make risk management more accurate and more reliable. In this paper, a new three-phase model is presented to supply chain sustainability risks management. This model includes the failure mode and effects analysis phase for identifying and assessing all risks and classification them, fuzzy VIKOR phase for ranking critical risks, and management phase to deal with critical risks. The categorization of risks was conducted according to a new five-dimensional approach to sustainable progress, including environmental, economic, social, technical, and organizational aspects on various sectors of the supply chain. The telecommunication industry of Iran is considered to show the model performance. The results indicated that consideration of the fuzzy VIKOR phase is necessary in order to accurately assess critical risks because of the priority of critical risks is not correctly identified through Failure mode and effects analysis due to the shortcomings of this method and cause errors.

Journal of Organization Design,"Sustainability provides new opportunities where firms need to create a sustainable business model with the optimal fit between the rising demands of a sustainable economy and their business model, strategy, structure, incentives, human skills, IT systems, and all the other aspects of the organizational design of the firm. Sustainability creates an important driver for organizational design: the way organizations operate and the way they should be designed. New thinking is required for designing organizations focusing on: strategy, structure, processes, and human skills and values to create a sustainable organization for the future. Sustainability must penetrate all activities and all relations in the firm. Integrating such a perspective into production, communication, supply chain, marketing, as well as in strategy, structure, processes, resources, products, and customer relations takes appropriate incentives and understanding of what drives people to create impact and change the way they do things. It all comes down to: how can we create Incentives to stimulate Innovation through the Integration of sustainability in a way that creates the biggest Impact? In this point-of-view paper, we make three points: (1) Sustainability will be a major driver for business strategy now and in the future. (2) For a sustainable organization, the organization design has to follow fundamental design principles based on the four I’s: Incentives, Innovation, Integration, and Impact. (3) Within the frame of the four I’s, the design should be based on a contingency perspective.","Obel B., Kallehave P.",Designing a sustainable organization: the four I’s framework,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133425009&doi=10.1007%2fs41469-022-00122-w&partnerID=40&md5=959b3e3c5a0d2a69ffecf0c75818e47a
PLoS ONE,"Sustainability, as a trend of social development and the embodiment of corporate social responsibility, has begun to receive more attention. To achieve this goal, sustainable supplier selection (SSS) and order allocation (OA) are seen as the crucial activities in corporate management. In the process of SSS, the psychological behavior of decision-makers (DMs) could play a critical role in the evaluation results. Therefore, introducing it into the decision-making process may lead to decision in line with the actual situation. In the uncertain multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem described by probability linguistic term sets (PLTS), the DMs can evaluate the criteria of each supplier based on his own preference and hesitation, which is useful to avoid the loss of information. For this reason, this study develops a novel multi-criteria group decision-making combined with fuzzy multi-objective optimization (MCGDM-FMOO) model for SSS/OA problems by considering the triple bottom line (TBL) in which includes economic, environmental and social factors. The proposed method includes four stages. (1) the best-worst method (BWM) and entropy weight method are utilized to assign the weights of criteria to obtain the comprehensive weight. According to the output weights, the an acronym for interactive and multi-criteria decision-making in Portugese (TODIM) approach is applied to rank the suppliers under PLTS environment; (2) a FMOO model that can effectively deal with uncertainties and dynamic nature of parameter is formulated for allocating optimal order quantities; (3) two novel approaches are utilized to solve the FMOO model in order to obtain the richer Pareto frontier; and (4) the final OA solution is achieved by technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Finally, the validity and practicability of proposed MCGDM-FMOO model are verified by an example and comparative analysis with other classical MCGDM methods.","Zhong S., Zhang J., He X., Liu S.",Sustainable supply chain partner selection and order allocation: A hybrid fuzzy PL-TODIM based MCGDM approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138431087&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0271194&partnerID=40&md5=d34cb3d1bf39d6639f71ccb9b781dfbe
International Journal of Production Research,"Sustainability, which inspires the inclusive development of economy, environment and society, has received extensive attention from practical and academic communities. Existing review literature on sustainable operations management (SOM) mainly focuses on firms' sustainable operations with the impact of regulators and consumers. However, the comprehensive interactions among three agents (firms, regulators and consumers) playing increasingly important roles in sustainable development are rarely investigated in SOM. This study proposes a novel firm–regulator–consumer (FRC) interaction framework to study operations decisions and interactive cooperation considering the interactions among three agents through a comprehensive literature review on SOM. We find that conflicts may exist between profits and sustainability goals, but can be balanced by the regulators' policies and consumers' green behaviours. The framework provides support for exploring some future research opportunities. Further attention could be paid to the interactions among firms (F–F), among regulators (R–R), among consumers (C–C) and social performance improvement. In particular, innovative business models (e.g. sharing economy, social media) and new disruptive technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, big data and 5G) play vital roles in achieving sustainability.","Hong Z., Zhang H., Gong Y., Yu Y.",Towards a multi-party interaction framework: state-of-the-art review in sustainable operations management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102787707&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2021.1894368&partnerID=40&md5=d4d2f7cebe2f873eb79686e38410d115
Autex Research Journal,"Sustainability-related risk and vulnerability management have attained significant attention from academia and industry. Manufacturing industries in developing countries such as Pakistan are under severe economic pressure and striving to boost sustainable supply chain practices for achieving business excellence. In this context, the objectives of the present research are to examine the critical supply chain risks associated with sustainable development goals, namely social, economic, and environmental factors. The failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) technique is employed for categorizing the risk factors and Pareto analysis for highlighting the more crucial and risky factors. For this purpose, a large-scale survey was carried out in the textile industries of Pakistan to develop a risk mitigation model for sustainability-related risks and vulnerability in a textile supply chain (TSC). It captures the input expressions of experts for risk factors, namely severity (s), occurrence (o), and detection (d) for calculating the risk priority numbers (RPNs) of identified alternatives. The results depict that endogenous environmental risks categorize as the most significant for the textile manufacturing industries, and the interfaces between the various risks associated with sustainability-related are also found very high.

Journal of Convention and Event Tourism,"Sustainable business events have the potential to diversify the tourism offering of destinations, to attract higher-spending visitors, and to elongate the tourism season, while economically, socially and environmentally benefiting host communities. Nonetheless, the incorporation of sustainability principles in business events requires coordinated actions and collaboration from a range of stakeholders, including service providers and those in decision-making positions. This research employed quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the perceptions of 50 business event attendees, 16 business event service providers, and five decision-makers in Cyprus with regards to the state of the business event sector’s sustainability, and obstacles and opportunities for its sustainable growth. Our findings suggest that very few sustainability practices are currently implemented in the organization of business events and demand for sustainability is relatively low. However, the provision of incentives coupled with trainings and capacity building for key actors within the supply chain as well as extensive horizontal awareness-raising activities could catalyze the transition of the business event sector toward sustainability and attract additional business events to Cyprus. Importantly, the emergence of a sustainable business event sector in Cyprus could also contribute to the sector’s and the country’s post-COVID-19 recovery.","Orthodoxou D.L., Loizidou X.I., Gavriel A., Hadjiprocopiou S., Petsa D., Demetriou K.","Sustainable business events: The perceptions of service providers, attendees, and stakeholders in decision-making positions",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112765001&doi=10.1080%2f15470148.2021.1964666&partnerID=40&md5=43f88674900c91eeb657c52425a3dce8
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Sustainable business practices are those that allow companies to increase their profit while still considering the triple bottom line of sustainability, which involves economic, environmental, and social aspects. There are a lot of studies exploring various aspects of supply chain practices. However, there remains a gap for the proposal of a complete framework concerning various industries. This research fills this gap by studying existing empirical and review studies. Based on a content analysis of 86 studies, 789 practices are derived and categorized, leading to a comprehensive classification of sustainable practices in supply chains. Moreover, the employed methods to analyze the data are investigated. The practices are cross-checked versus the studied industries showing the current sustainable industries. The details of the studied papers are presented in a comprehensive table. The sustainable framework showing the industrial solutions toward sustainable supply chains is divided into 38 minor practices classified into 11 main categories. This paper provides a novel interpretation of the sustainable solutions addressed by different industries and presents a new and updated classification of the literature identifying future directions.

Results reveal that the lack of technological up-gradation, lack of customer attitude and behaviour towards SCP, lack of incentives for/motivation of business organizations, lack of top management commitment, support, dedication and involvement, and customers who are attracted towards cheap products come under causal group challenges, which can help the decision makers formulate a policy for a successful implementation of SCP practices that will help achieve sustainable development goals.","Islam Md.R.-U., Begum L., Hossain A.",An Investigation Approach for Assessing Challenges to Sustainable Consumption and Production Practices in the Leather Goods Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127315512&doi=10.31881%2fTLR.2021.37&partnerID=40&md5=190350f132a854120bfa538d9c2ea195
Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Sustainable development emergent subfields have been rapidly evolving, and their popularity increased in recent years. Sustainable development is a broad concept having numerous sub-concepts including, but not limited to, circular economy, sustainability, renewable energy, green supply chain, reverse logistics, and waste management. This polymorphism makes decision-making in this field to be an abstruse task. In this perplexing circumstance, the presence of VUCA conditions makes decision-making even more challenging. By taking advantage of artificial intelligence tools and approaches, this paper aims to study with a concentration on sustainable development-related decision-making under VUCA phenomena elements using bibliometric and network analyses which can propose numerous novel insights into the most recent research trends in this area by analyzing the most influential and cited research articles, keywords, author collaboration network, institutions, and countries that finally provides results not previously fully comprehended or assessed by other studies on this topic.

Procedia Computer Science,"Sustainable development goals may be reached with some bold country policies but also optimizing any manufacturing process. Awareness of the large amount of waste produced along the dairy supply chain, for instance, raised great concern: continuous questions are raised about the consequences that will affect environmental sustainability, the continuous waste of resources and, above all, the future health of the entire ecosystem. In fact, dairy wastewater cannot be disposed of as simple wastewater (due to the high organic load and the nutrients it contains); therefore, adequate disposal processes and techniques are requested. The latter have a huge impact on company production costs.

International Journal of Production Economics,"Sustainable development has become a prerequisite for any organization that ensure environmental, economic, and social sustainability during the production process. However, how lean manufacturing helps to achieve each of the three dimensions of sustainability was not adequately considered by prior studies, since one type of sustainability or the concept of sustainability as a whole has been investigated. Moreover, few studies investigated the combined effect of lean practices and Sustainability-Oriented Innovation (SOI) on each type of sustainability. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of lean manufacturing practices on Triple Bottom Line (TBL) by taking SOI as a mediator. Data of 392 managers from different manufacturing organizations in Jordan was collected through well-structured questionnaire. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to check the relationship between latent and observed variables. The results reveal that both lean practices and SOI has significant and positive effect on TBL. Although lean manufacturing focus on efficiency while sustainability-oriented innovation promotes responsiveness to customers. Besides, SOI plays a partial mediating role between lean manufacturing and sustainable development.

Improving Sustainable Viticulture and Winemaking Practices,"Sustainable development involves three basic pillars: environmental, economic, and social. In the case of the wine sector, sustainability needs to integrate the concept defined by economics, ecology, and community dimensions for both grape and wine production. The wine industry is a large, globalized, and diversified sector encompassing multiple production systems and cultures, diverse management choices and a wide range of monitoring tools and solutions. This chapter presents and discusses the most relevant risks and concerns of modern wine industry and major sustainability issues related to wine production and related supply chain. The wine sector must implement more sustainable practices to mitigate climate change impacts and to decrease its environmental impact while ensuring its important economic and social function. Metrics and standards are required to support audits, efficient management, and regulatory parameters. Social issues must be addressed by the sector, especially because it strongly relies on human resources and manual labor. Research and development activities and related innovation (e.g., digitalization, sensors, mechanization, and recycling) can result in improved sustainability and resilience while the lack of transparency of the sector will harm confidence of consumers and competiveness.","Costa J.M., Catarino S., Escalona J.M., Comuzzo P.",Achieving a more sustainable wine supply chain—Environmental and socioeconomic issues of the industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137611312&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-323-85150-3.00009-8&partnerID=40&md5=9ddd8a11d891e79be6ac6ea58a977d28

The pandemic has transformed the purchasing habits of goods, especially food products, its packaging and consequently the packaging sector as a whole is directly involved. Together with this remarkable transformation, sustainability represents another challenge of equal impact. Two surveys carried out by Nomisma Observatory in 2019 and 2020 targeting 1,000 and 1,008 consumers respectively on consumer packaged goods together with some direct qualitative interviews with packaging companies helped understand how consumer sensitization to issues of sustainability can change the packaging products, the materials used and the production methods and technologies. Manufacturing and packaging companies are facing a difficult challenge to better communicate the issue of sustainability through their products and the challenge of their clients in finding adequate margins to accelerate change in a market of consumers who are in part sensitive to sustainable development but not so willing to change their consumer spending behaviour. This study examines the possible obstacles in the value chain starting from the companies that produce packaging machinery, which must be able to process new materials, up to the production companies which in turn use such machinery for packaging their product to be offered to the final consumer. It is a team game that must involve government, industry, retailers and consumers.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Sustainable excellence can be achieved by including sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices within the existing practices of industries. However, in developing countries such as India, industries, in general, are less willing to modify their existing traditional supply chain activities without pressures or motivations, which is the case in the automotive industries. The literature on SSCM pressure by the various stakeholders is limited in the Indian context. To fill this void in the literature, the present study examines the pressure for the adoption of sustainability in Indian supply chains, particularly in the context of the automotive industry. The automotive sectors to implement SSCM were identified from the literature review and the relationships among the elements were established using contextual, relationship-based, total interpretive structural modeling (TISM). The pressures were subjected to Matrice d'Impacts Cross-impact Matrix multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis to classify the different groups of pressures based on their driving powers and dependence. The developed TISM model was further assessed by a different group of industry experts to ensure its validity. The findings inferred that government regulations, the special benefits of social and environmental certifications, and the interests of the foreign investor in sustainable product development, are the most influential pressures for SSCM adoption in Indian automotive component manufacturing industries.","Mathivathanan D., Agarwal V., Mathiyazhagan K., Saikouk T., Appolloni A.",Modeling the pressures for sustainability adoption in the Indian automotive context,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125669008&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.130972&partnerID=40&md5=6634f75fc13591c5dd1d2ac2f751ec28
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Sustainable Human Resource Management (SHRM) involves balancing the activities of an organisation, considering environmental, economic, and social aspects, which can enable corporate sustainability. The research analysed the SHRM in the Supply Chain (SC) in João Pessoa/PB, based on the structuring of the SHRM_SC model. The differential in connecting sustainable HRM to stakeholders in the supply chain allowed the structuring of a new framework through three stages: adaptation, validation, and application. The 15 largest construction companies in the city were selected, and 15 specialists affiliated with Associação Brasileira de Recursos Humanos da Paraíba (Brazilian Human Resources Association - Paraíba) participated in the validation stage. As a result, specific characteristics of the subsector were identified, and it has been integrating sustainability into its activities, though incipient. The fact that sustainable HRM is emerging reveals a greater tendency to apply the model in the Health, Safety and Quality of Life at Work, and Training and Development subsystems.

Science of the Total Environment,"Sustainable phosphorus (P) management presents challenges in crop production and environmental protection; the current understanding of chemical P-fertilizer manufacturing, rock phosphate (RP) mining, P loss within supply chains, and strategies to mitigate loss is incomplete because of a fragmented understanding of P in the crop production supply chain. Therefore, we develop a knowledge-based management theoretical framework to analyze P supply chains to explore ways to mitigate China's P crisis. This framework connects upstream P industries and crop production, addressing knowledge gaps and stakeholder involvement. We demonstrate the potential to improve P use efficiency in the supply chain, thereby mitigating the P crisis using optimized P management. Our results showed that P footprint and grain production demand for RP can be reduced without yield penalty using a crop-demand-oriented P supply chain management that integrates P use in crop production, P-fertilizer manufacturing, and RP mining.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Sustainable production and consumption of food systems cannot be achieved without considering the entirety of the supply chain and the actors involved at each stage along the way. This requires more in-depth analyses of social dimensions often neglected in favor of the environmental and economic ones. Yet, inattention to the social dimension of sustainability in food supply chains has yielded a lack of agreement regarding what to consider and how to measure it. This review identifies the current state of art of how social sustainability aspects are measured through various tools and indicators, following the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses” (PRISMA) protocol. The selection criteria resulted in 101 papers and gray literature documents published from 2000 to 2021. Thirty-four social sustainability tools are analyzed based on five food supply chain stages, namely production, processing, wholesale, retail, and consumer and four stakeholders as adapted from the most recent Social Life Cycle Assessment guidelines, namely farmers, workers, consumers, and society. Production and processing-related assessment tools are mostly publicly funded, while wholesale, retail, and consumer tools are often privately funded. Moreover, the availability of assessment tools decreases along the supply chain. Production has the highest number of tools (17) and quantitative indicators, targeting mostly farmers through job conditions and quality of life indicators. Processing stage tools (5) target mostly workers, through quantitative indicators related to fair job conditions. The wholesaler stage tools (4) and indicators are the least connected, while the retail stage (2) is the most inclusive in terms of qualitative social sustainability indicators. The consumer stage tools (2) also has a low number of social indicators and interactions, despite being the stage that influences the supply chain the most. It is clear that food supply chain stakeholders can benefit from the implementation of social sustainability aspects, although these benefits become inconsistent if not respected in each stage. A need for an unceasing thread of respected social sustainability should permeate the whole supply chain, as environmental certification currently does, becoming the priority for policy makers in the sector to focus their attention on the emerged hotspots for intervention from this research.","Desiderio E., García-Herrero L., Hall D., Segrè A., Vittuari M.",Social sustainability tools and indicators for the food supply chain: A systematic literature review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122286923&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2021.12.015&partnerID=40&md5=5c07c3f0eabf9cd28f78cc4cac1e00e9
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Sustainable production includes economic, environmental, and social aspects. However, social sustainability has received less attention, especially compared to the economic aspects. Next to technical and organizational measures, social improvements within supply chains can also be achieved through suitable production planning. Within production planning, production programs are determined, and the assignment of available resources (e.g., employees) is specified. Thus, the utilization and workload of employees are defined. This systematic literature review investigates to what extent such employee-related social aspects are reflected in production planning and discusses whether economic aspects dominate them. For this, a Scopus database search was carried out and 76 identified approaches were analyzed and categorized regarding the occurring employee-related social aspects and their implementation. Thus far, the approaches mainly consider single aspects on single planning levels. A consideration of a broad set of aspects along the entire production planning has rarely been studied. In particular, health and safety aspects are considered on the levels of assembly line balancing and job rotation. However, their impact is primarily determined by the specific settings of the decision-maker. To support decision-makers, only a few studies have investigated the effects based on real application scenarios. Further potential might be an extended modeling of social and economic interdependencies and a consideration of employee-related social aspects in medium-to long-term production planning.","Trost M., Claus T., Herrmann F.",Social Sustainability in Production Planning: A Systematic Literature Review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133883765&doi=10.3390%2fsu14138198&partnerID=40&md5=3f1f00bee2f23a2c62c4b185ba352948

Several of these barriers are already known, but to date, no study has sought to consolidate them. To fill this gap, we conducted fifteen interviews with Brazilian managers of consumer goods companies, certification/standardisation bodies, and suppliers of raw materials. The analysis resulted in a consolidated table of barriers and a conceptual model that establishes the relationships between different stakeholders and the respective barriers. We found that consumer goods companies face barriers that are mainly related to their relationships with suppliers and standardisation bodies, in addition to internal issues.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Sustainable supplier development (SSD) deals with how partner firms help their suppliers improve sustainable performance. Recently, SSD has received increased attention in academia and practice. In line with the emergence of supply chain sustainability, SSD evolved from being a primarily environmental perspective to a perspective incorporating corporate social responsibility and business ethics, and eventually a holistic sustainability perspective. This evolution led to a gap in theory as to the lack of a clear boundary between SSD and other sustainable supplier management practices, and a gap in practice on understanding how such practices help buying firms improve their supplier sustainability capabilities. A content-analysis based literature review is used to develop a framework for understanding the foundations of past research to address the above two important concerns and to come up with promising avenues for future research. For this purpose, a total of 47 SSD articles published in recognized academic journals during the decade 2010–2021 (August) are selected, categorized, analyzed and identified to highlight the current research status and opportunities. This article introduces a structural framework to critically examine past articles within four categories – concepts, practices, problems and solutions. The framework provides a general roadmap for future research opportunities. The review presented offers academicians and practitioners a better understanding of SSD towards a more coherent evolution of future research and practice in this area.","Bai C., Satir A.",A critical content-analysis of sustainable supplier development literature and future research directions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133645461&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.132443&partnerID=40&md5=7821c3a10327e29bc3ea29849065cb1d

Axioms,"Sustainable supplier selection (SSS) is gaining popularity as a practical method to supply chain sustainability among academics and practitioners. However, in addition to balancing economic, social, and environmental factors, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the selection of long-term suppliers to ensure sustainable supply chains, recover better from the pandemic and effectively respond to any future unprecedented crises. The purpose of this study is to assess and choose a possible supplier based on their capability to adapt to the COVID-19 epidemic in a sustainable manner. For this assessment, a framework based on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is provided that integrates spherical fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (SF-AHP) and grey Complex Proportional Assessment (G-COPRAS), in which spherical fuzzy sets and grey numbers are used to express the ambiguous linguistic evaluation statements of experts. In the first stage, the evaluation criteria system is identified through a literature review and experts’ opinions. The SF-AHP is then used to determine the criteria weights. Finally, the G-COPRAS method is utilized to select sustainable suppliers. A case study in the automotive industry in Vietnam is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach’s effectiveness. From the SF-AHP findings, “quality”, “use of personal protective equipment”, “cost/price”, “safety and health practices and wellbeing of suppliers”, and “economic recovery programs” have been ranked as the five most important criteria. From G-COPRAS analysis, THACO Parts (Supplier 02) is the best supplier. A sensitivity study was also conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed model, in which the priority rankings of the best suppliers are very similar. For long-term development and increased competitiveness, industrial businesses must stress the integration of response mechanisms during SSS implementation in the COVID-19 epidemic, according to the findings. This will result in significant cost and resource savings, as well as reduced environmental consequences and a long-term supply chain, independent of the crisis.","Dang T.-T., Nguyen N.-A.-T., Nguyen V.-T.-T., Dang L.-T.-H.",A Two-Stage Multi-Criteria Supplier Selection Model for Sustainable Automotive Supply Chain under Uncertainty,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130571378&doi=10.3390%2faxioms11050228&partnerID=40&md5=356c8b734f0b69f84910b4bd5326bacc
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Sustainable supplier selection is a pressing mater in supply chain management. This paper tackles the main pain points in decision making during supplier selection and order allocation (SSS & OA) under uncertainties for a multi-item, multi-period setting, where each supplier has its own pricing policy. In the first phase, a hybrid BWM-ER method is employed for evaluating and ranking suppliers. In this method, the best worst method (BWM) for determining weights of the sustainability criteria and evidential reasoning (ER) for evaluating suppliers under uncertainty are used. Based on constraints related to demand, capacity, inventory, and allowed shortages in the next phase, a bi-objective mathematical model is presented, to make a trade-off between sustainability and economic cost. The demand is assumed to be stochastic, and there are uncertainties in the availability of suppliers during different periods. The combination of these two uncertainties is studied via a set of scenarios. A new integrated solution approach based on stochastic programming and dynamic programming to solve the bi-objective model under uncertainties is presented. The proposed approach results are compared with the results obtained via revised multi-choice goal programming and the Epsilon constraint method for a real-life case. These comparisons show that by using the new method, better and faster results are obtained. Sensitivity analysis is used to reveal the effect of quantity discounts, uncertainties in suppliers’ availability and demand.

Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science,"Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM hereinafter) plays a significant role in the development of business strategies. Scholars and practitioners have thus devoted their effort to investigating the driving forces of SSCM and measures which serve to enhance its performance. A review of extant literature indicates that previous studies have focused on internal and external pressures as the main drivers of SSCM, while the crucial role of the diversity of the supply chain alliance system has not received sufficient attention. In view of such a literature gap, this research aims to explore the contribution of alliance portfolio diversity in sustainable supply chain practices and its impact on SSCM performance. Relevant diversity-related theories are applied to explain the mechanisms of alliance portfolio diversity and their effect on SSCM performance through several mediating roles. Furthermore, the current research framework is tested within contingencies, thereby providing better insight into the studied subject matter. A field study is conducted to examine the proposed framework and related hypotheses wherein survey data comprised from the participation of more than 300 manufacturing firms are collected and tested. An analysis of the findings confirms the significant role of alliance portfolio diversity in SSCM performance, in particular under contingencies. As a result of such findings, this current research not only provides field evidence for the applicability of applied theories, but also draws a set of theoretically grounded guidance criteria into SSCM policies for field practitioners to enhance supply chain performance within the scope of sustainability.","Nguyen T.T., Le A.N.H., Cheng J.M.S.",The Role of Alliance Portfolio Diversity in Sustainable Supply Chain Management: An Abstract,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127985912&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-89883-0_60&partnerID=40&md5=ce0c14983da9bbb85f63846ae49a4f56

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has received extensive attention by academia and industries recently. However, there are increasing yet still scarce studies measuring the social sustainability performance of supply chain and discussing the interrelationship between social and economic sustainability. Further, the measurement does not fully utilize key performance indicators (KPIs) attributing to the lack of understanding of precise quantitative gauge of the supply chain social sustainable performance. To bridge this gap, this study analyses the social and economic sustainability performance in terms of demand planning, innovation, manufacturing, finance, sales and customer relationship, distribution and delivery and compliance. A framework is proposed to locate key metrics to evaluate the social sustainable supply chain (SSC) performance. A hybrid fuzzy-AHP–DEMATEL–VIKOR method is designed to investigate the social sustainability of supply chain. Data analysis and a case study are given to validate and support the feasibility and potency of the proposed approach. The robustness of our proposed model is executed via sensitivity analysis. From the proposed framework, demand planning and distribution and delivery are found to be the most critical criteria in economic and social dimension, respectively.","Guo R., Wu Z.",Social sustainable supply chain performance assessment using hybrid fuzzy-AHP–DEMATEL–VIKOR: a case study in manufacturing enterprises,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135224940&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-022-02565-3&partnerID=40&md5=86a6bb005aae34c4d66075880e27c1b6

EMJ - Engineering Management Journal,"Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) plays an important role in the success of the company’s sustainability progress. Industrial management faces difficulty designing a resilient, sustainable supply chain (SSC) with emerging new needs. Hence, the industrial management needs to integrate the customers’ requirements (CRs) in designing the SSC as customer satisfaction plays an important role in the success. Knowing the CRs, the industries may figure out the technical requirements (TRs) that may enhance the industries’ technical capability. This study proposes an integrated approach to help design a resilient SSC by considering both CRs and TRs. The integrated approach consists of the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), fuzzy measuring attractiveness by a categorically based evaluation technique (FMACBETH), and quality function deployment (QFD). The results obtained with FAHP and FMACBETH are incorporated into QFD to identify needed TRs. A case study is conducted to verify the integrated approach. Reduced carbon footprint, affordable cost, and on-time delivery are the three important CRs: financial strategy, green supply chain management, and government assistance are the three critical TRs.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"Sustainable value creation is a term that is widely used in sustainable business model literature, and it is gaining importance in other management fields. While there is still confusion on the meaning of this concept, researchers encourage studies that take a network perspective to generate new knowledge and a better understanding of it. In this paper, we address this call by taking a supply chain perspective, which is a type of network, and by focusing on one specific supply chain activity: procurement. Through a single case study of a French multinational, we investigate who creates sustainable value and for whom, taking a stakeholder theory lens. The case study is based on an inductive and qualitative-driven mixed-methods approach, involving interviews of key procurement and sustainability employees, ethnographic observation, and content analysis to provide new knowledge in both the sustainable business model and sustainable supply chain management fields. The findings provide empirical data that show, in the case of the firm studied, that the procurement function has a key role to play to create sustainable value for multiple stakeholders within and outside the firm. Sustainable procurement creates sustainable value for the firm, suppliers, clients, investors, municipalities, schools, NGOs, and associations. This value relates to economic, social, environmental and ethical dimensions. To our knowledge, this is the first study that clearly underlines the role of sustainable procurement to create sustainable value, which is relevant to guide researchers in digging further the importance of the procurement function and the supply chain lens in the sustainable business model field. The findings also highlight the need for top management and supporting functions such as finance to build capacity among the procurement department to develop sustainable procurement practices as, with a long-term perspective, it improves the sustainability performance of the firm and its supply chain partners.

Procedia CIRP,"Systems of Systems combine constituent systems (such as financial, transportation, energy, food, and water) to improve performance. System of Systems employment, however, often requires additional material and infrastructure investment. Due to their widespread use, it is essential that Systems of Systems are sustainable. One approach to increasing Systems of Systems sustainability is to increase its resilience (e.g. a less-resilient System of Systems would require additional resources to recover from a fault). The need for increased Systems of Systems resilience inspired our research question: How does SoS resilience change environmental impact during post-fault operation? To examine this research question, a model of an electric motor supply chain is examined. The supply chain architecture is divided into two parallel supply chains servicing four distribution centers. If supply to a distribution center is disrupted, the non-impacted supply chain can provide motors, but at a changed use-phase impact due to new shipping routes (e.g. further geographic distance). To answer our research question, each of the 14 constituents were disrupted one at a time, supply rerouting occurred as necessary, and the change in operational impact is reported (additional km of supply chain travel per week. This study provides key evidence that even if System of System infrastructure repair could occur without impact, changes in operational impact is an important factor for decision makers.

Findings reveal that the benefits of BCT have mostly been conceptually demonstrated in the sustainable supply chain literature, but with few practical applications. Moreover, technically driven challenges including scalability and control are still prevalent. It reaffirms the fact that participants within a blockchain enabled supply chain network must be at the same level of knowledge regarding the technology and its functionality. The study also indicates evidence of a growing research interest in the niche, which will eventually bring about solutions to address ongoing challenges faced by BCT in its integration into supply chain management.

Lecture Notes in Logistics,"Technological advancements, increased globalization, political, social, and environmental concerns are changing the world we live in. Firms applying a global strategic management approach to enter a new country have to dynamically assess and align their performance objectives and micro capabilities with the changing macro logistics higher-order capabilities and resources at the regional or country level, and vice versa. Higher-order capabilities are present in a specific location and emerge over time as a result of systematic interactions across firms and institutions, whereas micro capabilities and performance objectives are firm-wide. Previous research on logistics and supply chain performance measurement hasn’t precisely addressed this macro-micro perspective with a global strategic management view. Furthermore, this aspect associating macro and micro capabilities and performance has been only projected with the help of case study-based empirical investigation within the previous research. To investigate the magnitude of this association, this research uses an integrative literature review strategy that includes a qualitative content analysis of the most important/cited supply chain performance measurement literature. With the help of a macro-micro supply chain performance measurement framework adapted from the supply chain performance measurement literature, the findings bring out the link between various macro logistics higher-order resources and capability elements (input) such as collaboration, knowledge sharing between logistics partners, transportation mode and energy efficiency and the strategic firm performance objectives and dynamic micro capabilities (output) such as sustainability and process innovation. It also extends framework propositions to guide future supply chain performance measurement research with a particular emphasis on global supply chain decision-making.","Bhardwaj D., Kinra A.",The Linkage Between Macro Logistics Capabilities and Micro Firm Performance Towards Framework Development for Supply Chain Performance Measurement,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129721519&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-05359-7_1&partnerID=40&md5=a8ece504543d22eb8e0f72cde4f9f836
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Technological advances such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, social media, and geographic information systems represent a building block of the digital transformation that supports the resilience of the food supply chain (FSC) and increases its efficiency. This paper reviews the literature surrounding digitalization in FSCs. A bibliometric and key-route main path analysis was carried out to objectively and analytically uncover the knowledge development in digitalization within the context of sustainable FSCs. The research began with the selection of 2140 articles published over nearly five decades. Then, the articles were examined according to several bibliometric metrics such as year of publication, countries, institutions, sources, authors, and keywords frequency. A keyword co-occurrence network was generated to cluster the relevant literature. Findings of the review and bibliometric analysis indicate that research at the intersection of technology and the FSC has gained substantial interest from scholars. On the basis of keyword co-occurrence network, the literature is focused on the role of information communication technology for agriculture and food security, food waste and circular economy, and the merge of the Internet of Things and blockchain in the FSC. The analysis of the key-route main path uncovers three critical periods marking the development of technology-enabled FSCs. The study offers scholars a better understanding of digitalization within the agri-food industry and the current knowledge gaps for future research. Practitioners may find the review useful to remain ahead of the latest discussions of technologyenabled FSCs. To the authors’ best knowledge, the current study is one of the few endeavors to explore technology-enabled FSCs using a comprehensive sample of journal articles published during the past five decades.","Rejeb A., Rejeb K., Abdollahi A., Zailani S., Iranmanesh M., Ghobakhloo M.",Digitalization in food supply chains: A bibliometric review and key-route main path analysis,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121676968&doi=10.3390%2fsu14010083&partnerID=40&md5=55a9cd837b116f4489f9958da48b1610
Environmental Progress and Sustainable Energy,"Technology plays a crucial role in fighting COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic impacts all facets of human life, including food preservation and supply chain. The changes in the food processing and preservation brings changes to the global food choice. In the age of the COVID-19 pandemic scare, the present article explores the framework for food security. It offers insights into food security with a focus on renewable energy to help rural farmers, besides, exploring the possibility of the diffusion of COVID-19 via food chain. This article indicates that the implementation of stand-alone and hybrid renewable energy systems is relatively fresh in food processing, preservation, and transportation chain. Green food preservation may be a revolutionary idea to address the challenges of the future to secure both producers and customers, besides, to improve the attractiveness of the ecological, economic, and creative sectors. This study reveals that the transformation can be achieved from a technological and economic point of view with the key steps to fulfill this goal in a cost-effective manner. The observation also shows a suitable methodology to identify the best energy, economic and environmental scenario towards fulfilling the energy needs in isolated areas.","Edwin M., Nair M.S., Sekhar S.J.",A comprehensive review on impacts of COVID-19 in food preservation and cold chain: An approach towards implementing green energy technologies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126026213&doi=10.1002%2fep.13820&partnerID=40&md5=ef2b31e68bd55b1bb1f48398fd69f332
Uncertain Supply Chain Management,"Telecom supply chain (TSC) research has determined several risk sources can happen for sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) due to their ambiguous nature. However, investigation of these risks is relatively sparse and has primarily been independent with less combinatory research, despite their interrelationships and causality. The present study aims to address that gap by an extant literature review and analysis of relationships among risk factors using a combination of fuzzy approaches. A mixed approach was used, including empirical data from private and government firms in a developing telecom sector. This research finding confirmed that economical dimension risk is major for SSCM in the TSC. In developing countries, it could help telecom service providers in determining which risk factors are critical and those that are crucially significant. As a result, they will be able to more effectively develop strategies focussing on the most affecting risk dimension for SSCM. This is the first study using a hybrid fuzzy approach that analysed interrelationships of risk factors for SSCM. Further, it gives a comprehensive view of risk assessment in the risk management context in the supply chain.","Nalluri V., Chen L.-S.",Risk assessment for sustainability on telecom supply chain: A hybrid fuzzy approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124524445&doi=10.5267%2fj.uscm.2021.11.007&partnerID=40&md5=6b5e08c2545adeda2a2b652a9f708202
"Environment, Development and Sustainability","Textiles products have high environmental impact compared to other products. Numerous studies have been performed on the environmental impact of various textile products and production-related activities with the aim to reduce the impact from textile supply chain. This report reviewed some existing studies on the environmental impact throughout the textile supply chain. It provides the background, practices and knowledge gaps in respect of the environmental implications of specific textile products as well as their supply chain. The literature generally confirms that the textile production stage and use stage contribute the highest impact for different impact categories. The recommendations for future work derived from this study include evaluation of the environmental impact of fibre mixing, environmental impact of various recycling/reuse options compared to landfill and environmental impact of technical/smart textile products. Investigation of the environmental impact and economic feasibility of different recycling options compared to the landfill option is a significant area of research which is involved in the policy development to increase circularity of textile waste. Analysis of the environmental impact of textile consumption and disposal using life cycle assessment in respect of different geographical location is also another future investigative topic to develop a model of sustainable supply chain.

IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,"Thailand is one of the most significant pineapple producers and exporters in the world. In 2020, the pineapple cultivation area is around 72,656 hectares, which generated agro-waste after harvesting such as leaves, rhizome, and stem. The estimation of waste from leaves is about 37.5 tons per hectare, which results in waste of around 2.7 million tons per year. In addition, most farmers burn agro-waste rather than decompose causing pollution problems. Previous research showed that pineapple leaves can be used as raw materials in other industries such as textiles, paper, packaging, reinforcing materials, etc. Meanwhile, in Thailand, very few producers have the potential to produce pineapple leaf fiber due to high production costs, insufficient production capacity, lack of knowledge and labor, etc. Therefore, this research studied the pineapple leaf fiber supply chain. The objectives were to analyze the present pineapple leaf fiber supply chain of the community enterprise, pinpoint key activities, challenges, and propose guidelines to solve problems. The related stakeholders were interviewed such as farmers, community enterprise, yarn manufacturers, collectors, and government agencies. Next, business processes were identified by applying the Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0). These main activities of IDEF0 are plan, source, make, deliver, and return. After the study, the challenges were uncertain demand, lack of break-even point and cost analysis, long production lead time and high production cost. Thus, the community enterprise should focus on finding a sustainable market, calculate the production cost analysis and apply Kaizen and Lean concepts to improve productivity and reduce production costs. Finally, our guidelines for fiber community enterprise can be employed in other community enterprises to enhance supply chain management and lead to sustainability.","Apipatpapha T., Ongkunaruk P., Chollakup R.",Pineapple leaf fiber supply chain analysis for the sustainability of community enterprise: A case study in Thailand,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138326572&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f1074%2f1%2f012032&partnerID=40&md5=8c1512ddbb29777ba4f1c978b33c584a
"Proceedings of 2022 12th International Conference on Power, Energy and Electrical Engineering, CPEEE 2022","Thailand's industry is a prime sector that consumes a significant amount of energy throughout its supply chain and operations This paper aims to evaluate the energy and environmental efficiency of Thailand's industry with the implementation of energy conservation measures to meet the national target of Energy Efficiency Plan 2018-2037 (EEP2018), Alternative Energy Development Plan 2018-2037 (AEDP2018), and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) targeting at the end of 2037. The efficiency evaluation shows a sustainability score, which consists of 11 indicators within three dimensions: energy, environmental, economic dimension. 4 Scenarios are studied; (1) BAU, (2) the implementation of high-efficiency equipment and energy conservation in designated factories, (3) the implementation of solar PV rooftop, and fuel switching in a boiler system, (4) the combination of scenario 2 and 3. 4 steps of the indicator scoring start from targeting, scoring, weighting, to aggregating. For Thai industry, the analysis shows that the energy score is at 78.99 in the BAU scenario and can be improved to 93.92 when implementing EEP2018 and AEDP2018 measures. Also, it suggests that the corresponding environmental score can be improved from 52.60 in BAU scenario to 80.62 in scenario 4. For BAU scenario, the economic score is shown as 55.75 and gets improved to 73.67 in scenario 4. Consequently, the sustainability score of Thai industry is summarized as 58.73. With the implementation of the EEP2018 measures, the industry can increase a score to 71.14, 21.27% higher than that of BAU. However, for scenario as an implementation of AEDP2018, it is shown that the sustainability score will decrease to 64.48. Then, the industry implements both EEP2018 and AEDP2018 measures, increasing a score to 79.86. In particular, the chemical sector can reach a perfect score of 100 in all three dimensions. This shows a great contribution to meet the national target and bring the sustainable development to the country. However, the non-metallic products sector reveals the lowest score but it can be improved by implementation of additional measures suitable for the industry such as carbon capture storage (CCS) in the cement industry, material substitution, and material efficiency, etc.","Jaitiang T., Vorayos N., Vorayos N.",The Energy and Environmental Efficiency Assessment of Energy System: A Case of Thailand's Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127948123&doi=10.1109%2fCPEEE54404.2022.9738715&partnerID=40&md5=2127b90221a323d08d6251c18c83aae5

Environmental and Resource Economics,"The “Dasgupta Review” of the economics of biodiversity (Dasgupta 2021) identifies many factors that threaten the ecological sustainability of our economies. This article examines how two policy failures - the underpricing and underfunding of nature – influence global land use change and terrestrial biodiversity loss. If natural areas are priced too cheaply, then converting them to agriculture, forestry and other land uses is less costly than protecting or preserving habitats. Underfunding nature further reduces the incentives for conservation and restoration. The current global funding gap for biodiversity is just under $900 billion annually, and especially impacts developing countries. Ending the underpricing of natural landscape requires removing environmentally harmful subsidies and adopting policies that place an additional cost on the use of land and natural resources or on pollution. Overcoming the funding gap means expanding public and private sources of financing nature, particularly for poorer countries, such as biodiversity offsets, payments for ecosystem services, debt-for-nature swaps, green bonds, sustainable supply chains and international environmental agreements.

Journal of Industrial Ecology,"The academic literature offers some insights about lagging progress on circular economy (CE) transition, including cultural, regulatory, market, and technical barriers. There is also an increasing body of knowledge about barriers to CE adoption that takes a macro-level perspective across industries. However, such studies have largely neglected the industry scale. This study fills that gap by examining barriers to CE transition in the Dutch technical and interior textiles industries. Using data from 27 interviews with manufacturers and retailers, the study finds that high costs for production and marketing, along with lack of consumer interest, are among the most substantial barriers. To provide a system-wide perspective, the study conceptualizes relationships among barriers as a chain reaction: limited knowledge of CE design options raises the difficulty and cost of delivering high-quality circular products at the firm level, while limited availability of circular supply streams combined with the orientation of existing production systems toward linear supply chains constrain CE transition at the industry level. These findings highlight the need for intervention at levels beyond the scale of individual firms, a key implication for public policy.","Hartley K., Roosendaal J., Kirchherr J.",Barriers to the circular economy: The case of the Dutch technical and interior textiles industries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113663023&doi=10.1111%2fjiec.13196&partnerID=40&md5=bd739c230e6e853597932eadf3ea9865

Business Strategy and the Environment,"The advent of blockchain technologies is transmuting the way conventional supply chains are being managed. Due to the complexity of dealing with many actors involved in the supply chain networks, contemporary supply chains have limited visibility, transparency, and accountability. Likewise, supply chains are increasingly facing the challenge of integration and sustainability. In this vein, blockchain technologies can play a groundbreaking role in improving the traceability, accountability, and sustainability of complex supply chain networks. The present study examines the instrumentality of blockchain technologies in enabling supply chain mapping and supply chain integration. The study also tests the direct impact of blockchain technologies on supply chain sustainability. Data are collected from 132 Malaysian Electrical and Electronics firms using a close-ended questionnaire. The study employs Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and Partial Least Squares-Multi Group Analysis (PLS-MGA) for analyzing the hypothesized relationships. The results show that blockchain technologies do not have a direct impact on supply chain sustainability. Nevertheless, this finding reveals a robust indirect effect of BT, through SC integration and SC mapping, on the SC sustainability. The study's findings imply that the notion of the sustainable supply chain can be significantly attained by mapping upstream, midstream, and downstream supply chains. The well-mapped supply chain can further improve supply chain sustainability. The findings of the study also suggest the adoption of blockchain technologies as a broad-based strategy to attain multi-tier goals, for example, supply chain mapping, sustainability, and integration.","Khan S.A., Mubarik M.S., Kusi-Sarpong S., Gupta H., Zaman S.I., Mubarik M.",Blockchain technologies as enablers of supply chain mapping for sustainable supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126769679&doi=10.1002%2fbse.3029&partnerID=40&md5=3435de5efb9598b36a95e6a39b8803c7

"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","The agri-food sector is one of the key sectors where the action is needed to ensure the transition to a more sustainable development model in line with the principles of the circular economy (CE). The use of indicators to monitor progress and areas for action is a key element in the shift of companies, regions, and countries toward a circular model. This study aims to create a dashboard that can be used at various spatial levels to guide the agri-food sector toward a CE and sustainable development. Starting with the relevant literature, we identified 102 indicators classified according to three areas of sustainability (environmental, economic and social) and spatial dimensions (macro‑meso-micro) within 8 scopes. The dashboard provides a toolbox for directing decision-making processes and strategies through the targeted use of indicators with respect to the context in which the CE is applied. In addition, the dashboard allows us to highlight missing aspects related to (1) new indicators not covered by the tool; (2) new scopes not yet explored in the literature; and (3) the need to adopt cross-sectional indicators. For this last aspect, the analysis revealed only 17 such indicators.

Polish Journal of Management Studies,"The aim of the research developed is to recognize the importance and impact of supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) in the horizontal collaboration as a relevant factor to mitigate the risks in the supply chain, but also to contribute to sustainability in SME’s that are located in emerging economies, even more face to the post-pandemic scenario. The methodology used to analyze the theoretical constructs related to the study was PRISMA declaration. It was applied using several databases (Scopus and Web of Science) and specific search equations investigating several lenses related to supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) as an adjuvant to create and promote horizontal collaborative networks (HCN). It mitigates the risks through collaborative processes between actors in the supply chain, developing resilience. The lenses considered are dynamic capabilities view, supply chain resilience and collaborative networks. The study results reveal that collaborative networks could support the risk management in supply chains that develop this practice. In the same way, supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) can be considered as a relevant factor in stimulating integration between different and exogenous actors of the supply chain in a horizontal collaboration, and also considering the collaboration as one of the most important supply chain dynamic capability (SCDC) to be developed for SME’s as a good way to dynamize their supply chains, avoid the risk and as a good practice to improve the corporate sustainability in emerging markets.","Alzate I.C., Manotas E.C., Manotas E.M., Boada A.",IMPACT OF SUPPLY CHAIN DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES (SCDC) AND HORIZONTAL COLLABORATION OVER SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE FOR SME’S SUSTAINABILITY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES [WPŁYW ZDOLNOŚCI DYNAMICZNYCH ŁAŃCUCHA DOSTAW (SCDC) I WSPÓŁPRACY POZIOMEJ NA ODPORNOŚĆ ŁAŃCUCHA DOSTAW NA ZRÓWNOWAŻONY ROZWÓJ MŚP W GOSPODARKACH WSCHODZĄCYCH],https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133974492&doi=10.17512%2fpjms.2022.25.2.05&partnerID=40&md5=2066bf825bc42e1c90322ca92b9be83a
Operations Management Research,"The aim of this paper is to present empirical evidence about the relationship between Agri-fresh Food Supply Chain Quality (AFSCQ) practices and Organizational Sustainability (OS) outcomes. Organizational Sustainability embraces economic, environment and social sustainability. Based on literature review, a set of AFSCQ practices has been identified to create a theoretical model and to setup their relationship to OS as Economic Sustainability (ECS), Social Sustainability (SOS) and Environmental Sustainability (ENS). The measurement scales of AFSCQ practices and measures of OS were established in four stages: initial instrument development; structured interviews and utilization of Q-sort method; wide-ranging data collection by survey questionnaire; and analysis to confirm reliability and validity. Finally, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to validate the model with survey data collected from Indian agri-fresh food industry. The study developed relationships between AFSCQ and OS. Specifically, Customer Focus (CF) and Supplier Management(SM), both have direct and indirect influence on OS while Top Management Leadership and Commitment to AFSCQ, Internal Management(IM) and Supply Chain Integration Management using IT(SCIMIT) have indirect and direct influences on OS, respectively. The results also show that AFSCQ practices should be executed as an integrated coordination instead of independent practices, wherein they co-operate with each other and enrich OS. The empirical outcomes of this paper give evidence to count the AFSCQ as a reliable medium for OS. The AFSCQ practices are favorable to develop organizational sustainability, and then improve economic, social and environmental performance indirectly. The suggested model establishes the relationship between AFSCQ and OS. Additionally, the model’s justification to utilize the Indian agri-fresh food industry gave significant insights both from theoretic and realistic perspectives.","Siddh M.M., Kumar S., Soni G., Jain V., Chandra C., Jain R., Sharma M.K., Kazancoglu Y.",Impact of agri-fresh food supply chain quality practices on organizational sustainability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114325284&doi=10.1007%2fs12063-021-00196-x&partnerID=40&md5=c3212cbac3374fa672d851d1c55685a1
Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"The aim of this paper is to provide a multi-criteria decision-making intelligent approach based on Industry 4.0 and Triple Bottom Line principles for sustainable supply chain development in the renewable energy sector. In particular, the solar photovoltaic energy supply chain is used as a case study, encompassing the entire energy production process, from supply to disposal. An exhaustive literature review is conducted to identify the main criteria affecting social, economic and environmental sustainability in the photovoltaic energy supply chain, and to explore the potential impact of Industry 4.0 on sustainability. Subsequently, three Fuzzy Inference Systems combining quantitative and qualitative data are built to calculate the supply chain's social, economic and environmental sustainability. Experts' opinions are used to identify the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on the three pillars of sustainability for each supply chain stage. Finally, a novel sustainability index, Sustainability Index 4.0, is formulated to compute the overall sustainability of the photovoltaic energy supply chain in seven countries.

In this paper, it is proposed to combine Green supply chain management (GSCM) and Total Quality Management (TQM) for reducing environmental risks, thus enhancing aviation spares supply chain's performance. Special attention is paid to the development of the specific framework for combining GSCM practices and TQM pillars in the entire supply chain at the stages of the product life cycle. The prospects of GSCM and TQM combination for the considered supply chain are identified through the prism of six key critical success factors of GSCM and general principles of TQM stated in the ISO 9000 family.

"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","The aluminum extrusion industry is growing rapidly; however, there has been little work on quantifying or reducing extrusion's environmental impacts. This article first derives cradle-to-gate cumulative energy demand, greenhouse gas emission, and cost models for direct aluminum extrusion using data collected from extrusion companies, life cycle inventory measurements (e.g., electricity demand) from our own case studies, and physics-based extrapolations. These models show there is significant scope for increasing both the process energy and material efficiency; however, only increasing the material efficiency will lead to significant environmental benefits and cost savings. Subsequently, an alloy-shape-application material flow analysis of the 2018 North American extrusion industry is conducted to highlight opportunities for improved material utilization throughout the supply chain. Material flow data were collated from existing academic and gray literature in addition to semi-structured interviews with North American extrusion experts. The material flow analysis reveals that around 40% of all aluminum cast into extrusion billets is scrapped before completion in a fabricated product, which increases the cost of the fabricated profile by approximately 16% and the greenhouse gas emissions and cumulative energy demand by approximately 40%. Most of this scrap is created by removing structural and surface finish extrusion defects that are inherent to the current process. Process adaptations that might reduce the material scrapped due to these defects are identified and discussed. Even a 10% reduction in extrusion process forming scrap could save the North American (U.S. and Canada) extrusion industry 270–311 million USD per year and prevent the release of 0.5–2.3 Mt.CO2eq annually.","Oberhausen G., Zhu Y., Cooper D.R.",Reducing the environmental impacts of aluminum extrusion,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121981297&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2021.106120&partnerID=40&md5=8050057f5c745f0cf0b0c033505ec3d9

The Digital Supply Chain,"The application of blockchain or, more generally, distributed ledger technology in logistics and supply chain management has created a huge amount of interest among academics and practitioners. Blockchain's inherent characteristics include immutable data, seamless information flows, and shared access to data. Also, the potential to deploy smart contracts (program code executed automatically) with blockchain has raised high hopes for improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of supply chains. In this chapter, we clarify the meaning of terms used in the blockchain ecosystem and present the results from an extensive literature review from which we summarize current findings. We highlight the principal drivers influencing blockchain adoption—traceability, trust and transparency, supply chain integration, data security, privacy, and sustainability. We note technical, organizational, and regulatory barriers that may inhibit adoption of blockchain in supply chain applications, including scalability, investment costs versus perceived benefits, data sharing and interoperability challenges, and lack of standards or regulations. Although blockchain adoption is still in its early stages, an increasing number of applications are being reported. We identify reported supply chain applications classified by industry sector.

Operations Management Research,"The application of blockchain technology (BT) to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has enriched the operations management processes with higher degrees of safety, traceability, transparency, and efficiency. This technology effectively helps prevent fake products and fraud across the supply chains, reducing costs and enhancing efficiency. However, the implementation of BT in supply chain management (SCM) is still in the initial stages since companies generally pay too much attention to the adoption phase while neglecting the managerial/organizational strategies required to succeed in this path; they also overlook the establishment of an effective link to the three main pillars of sustainability (i.e., the environmental, social, and economic aspects). Despite high potentials formerly confirmed for BT, a number of barriers have blocked the rapid adoption of this technology. Accordingly, the current study attempts to propose an innovative model hybridizing the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) and criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) methods to identify and evaluate the barriers to the BT adoption in SSCM in the manufacturing sector. In the proposed model, CRITIC is responsible for calculating the criteria weights, and CoCoSo for evaluating the preference order of the organization. To exhibit the practicality of the introduced model, a case study is taken to evaluate the barriers to the adoption of BT in SSCM within PFSs environment. Moreover, we exhibit a sensitivity analysis over parameter values in view of examining the stability of our proposed approach. Finally, we draw attention to a comparison between our developed PF-CRITIC-CoCoSo decision-making framework with an existing PF-WASPAS method to show its superiority and potency.","Han X., Rani P.",Evaluate the barriers of blockchain technology adoption in sustainable supply chain management in the manufacturing sector using a novel Pythagorean fuzzy-CRITIC-CoCoSo approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129881270&doi=10.1007%2fs12063-021-00245-5&partnerID=40&md5=63580d987d8b2e207794d00f58062ed6

Ecological Economics,"The assessment of sustainability at the level of the agri-food supply chain is complex.Achieving sustainability in agri-food chains requires coordinated interaction between chain actors. The aspect of coordination is rarely included in the assessment of sustainability and current assessment methodologies do not allow conclusions about the linkage between coordination and sustainability. This paper analyzes the state of the art in the assessment of agri-food supply chain sustainability based on a structured literature review. Following the structured review that includes category analysis and content analysis, we develop a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for agri-food chains across multiple stages. The novelty of the framework is to incorporate the dimension of coordination across chain stages as a critical sustainability dimension. The study contributes to research on the assessment of agrifood supply chain sustainability by incorporating the role of coordination across chain stages and its relationship with economic, environmental, and social performance. This essential relationship between coordination and sustainability offers several areas of interest for future research.

Expert Systems with Applications,"The automotive industry is one of the most competitive sectors, and it requires a well-structured logistics system to meet the industry' vital requirements such as just-in-time, lean and agile supply chain operations, productivity and sustainability. Well-located and well-designed warehouses can make reaching these aims for the automotive industry possible and more accessible. Hence, determining a location for a warehouse is a highly critical, tactical, and managerial resolution for the automotive industry, as there is a strong correlation between well-located warehouses and the well-structured logistics network in the automotive industry. Although the WSS is a significant decision-making problem, we observed four critical and severe gaps in the existing literature: (1) the authors preferred to apply traditional objective & subjective frames, and they overlooked existing highly complicated uncertainties. (2) The number of studies focusing on the WSS problem in the automotive industry is surprisingly scarce. (3) It is not sufficiently clear how these factors used in the previous studies were determined, which causes doubts about their reliability. (4) there is no satisfactory evidence of which approaches were used to identify the factors in the previous papers. By considering these gaps, we propose two approaches which can be accepted as a novelty of the paper. First is the extension of the Delphi techniques based on the Fermetean fuzzy sets (FFs) used for identifying the criteria. It also combines the two traditional approaches (i.e., literature review and professionals' evaluations to identify the criteria) with the FF-Delphi technique. The second is the Double Normalized MARCOS approach based on FFs (FF- DN MARCOS) implemented to identify the weights of the criteria and ranking performance of the alternatives. The proposed model was implemented to identify the best warehouse location for the automotive manufacturing company. The results show that the C1 “energy availability & cost” criterion is the most influential criterion and the C5 proximity to port and customs criterion is the second most crucial factor.

Procedia CIRP,"The beginning of the 21st century is marked by the fourth industrial revolution, which could be a great opportunity for a sustainable technological transformation. The key role of these technologies in the development of a more sustainable future implies the need for the evaluation and monitoring of both supply risks as well as environmental and social impacts of a number of raw materials in the supply chain. These raw materials that are important to the economy and might be under supply risk are referred to as Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) in the EU. The integration of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) - well established for sustainability evaluation - and Criticality Assessment (CA) - increasingly used as governance tool - is therefore consequent to support decision-making regarding efficient use those natural resources. Based on a critical review of CA methods within and outside the framework of an LCSA, this research aimed to investigate the compatibility of CA methods with the life-cycle approach. The methods range from specific CA methodologies (e.g., NRC (USA) and EC-CA (EU)) to the existing methods integrating CA and LCSA (e.g., ESSENZ and GeoPolRisk). The evaluation of the methods was based on a set of criteria (e.g., acceptance and credibility) and further analysis of compatibility with frameworks from ISO 14040-44 and UNEP-SETAC. The current challenges for integration in the field are identified, namely: interpretation of criticality within the three pillars of sustainability (social, economic or environmental); the incompatibility among inventories and the characterization of material's criticality; arbitrariness in the interpretation of what is ""critical""; and the uncertainty intrinsic to CA models. Potential solutions towards the operationalization of criticality indicators in a product-oriented LCSA include the definition of the impact pathway of criticality in LCSA, the linkage of criticality indicators to product/technological flows, the use of intermediate indicators (supply risk and economic importance), the characterization of criticality at the normalization and weighting step, and addressing uncertainties in an LCSA.

With the recent focus on environmental preservation and sustainability, as well as government pushes toward sustainable growth, firms are ready to use a green future strategy to increase market share and outperform competitors. The current study aims to provide an insight into the perspectives of various agents of construction supply chain and enhance the construction market sustainability. Further, the factors that influence supplier selection and sustainability are explored and the relevant supply chain participants' perspectives to the current state of sustainability in construction supply chains is investigated. In the current research the key trends in sustainable construction supply chain management are analysed using a sample of 279 responses from construction raw material manufacturers and suppliers, logistic teams, and end users. This study also will seek to determine how companies are understanding sustainable supply chain management processes and how it stands in their business in terms of cost, supply chain orientation and effectiveness. Relative Importance Index method (RII) is used to evaluate the responses of the survey. It was observed that the suppliers believe that they are doing enough to conserve resources and conserve the environment, while the clients perceive that the suppliers’ efforts are insufficient. While the manufacturing industries claim that emissions are measured on a regular basis, but only a few of them publish emission reports on their websites. Although the industry believes that adopting sustainable practices in manufacturing and along the supply chain will result in future cost savings and increased market penetration in dynamic markets, it has been observed that the initial high investments and a lack of proven models are impeding the adoption of sustainable practices.

The unsustainability issues are arises due to environmental unease such as climate change, global warming, resource scarceness, and ecological degradation. Circular Supply chain (CSC) has gained momentum in the last few years and acts as one of the sustainable and innovative approach for the manufacturing industry. CSC adoption enhances the social, economical, and ecological aspects of the production and supply chain system. However, very less research has been done on the identification and exploration of numerous challenges to CSC implementation in developing nations, particularly, in India. Thus, this research objective is to explore and evaluate the challenges to CSC implementation in the perspectives of Indian manufacturing sector. Total 24 CSC challenges are recognized through literature review and experts input. This research proposes the Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (PF-AHP) technique. This technique is used to prioritize the challenges of CSC adoption based on their relative importance. The empirical example of an Indian case organization is considered for demonstration of the applicability of proposed method. The result reveals that lack of top management support is the most crucial challenge to CSC adoption.

Environmental Research Letters,"The cattle industry in the Brazilian Amazon causes vast deforestation while producing at only one-third of the sustainable capacity. Slaughtering cattle at a younger age directly increases production per hectare per year, all else equal, and provides a potential path for sustainable intensification. Here we show that slaughter age is decreasing in the Amazon biome, but this increase in productivity varies across space and throughout the cattle supply chain. We characterize the properties and municipalities that have reduced slaughter age, providing insights into the incentives and barriers to this form of intensification. Most notably, reductions in slaughter age occurred in regions with low remaining forest cover and on properties with little current deforestation, suggesting that ranchers intensify via slaughter age as an alternative to deforestation. We then estimate how changing production practices to reduce slaughter age can reduce enteric methane emissions, accounting for production of additional feed. Our results indicate that reducing slaughter age through improved pasture and feed sources are a path to lower global GHG emissions from cattle production, particularly as beef is increasingly produced in developing countries with historically higher emissions.

Proceedings - SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition,"The challenge of climate change and the imperative of moving to a low carbon economy has intensified and added to traditional objectives of affordable, safe, and clean energy in oil and gas production. Recycling parts from artificial lift equipment has been an industry-standard practice for decades. Equipment component reclaim has been a way to deliver high-quality, cost-effective products to our customers, especially in tough market times. It will be a critical best practice to reduce carbon emissions and enhance environmental sustainability. With customer cooperation, service companies develop procedures to re-use the most significant components of an Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) system. These include the pump, cable, seal chamber section, and motor. The motor stator, bearings, and rotors are a high percentage of reclaimable parts in an ESP system. Reclaiming the induction motor (IM) rotors has been standard practice for decades. However, with the advent of permanent magnet motors (PMM) and the change in rotor construction, the current process does not apply. The driving force for PMM application is to improve energy efficiency and lower cradle to grave carbon emissions. We could not fully realize the vision of environmental sustainability and reduced carbon footprint if PMM rotors were not part of the reclaim process. Therefore, recycling the PMM rotors strengthens the justification for replacing IMs with PMMs, especially given that the value of magnetic material is highly variable and has doubled in the past year. The PMM rotors from a recovered motor may suffer from de-magnetization or be contaminated with production fluids or metal debris. Like IM rotors, the most effective method to remove contaminants from the PM rotor is to bake at high temperatures for a period. However, baking the PMM rotor magnets at elevated temperatures will be at least partially de-magnetized during the process and result in the PMM rotors no longer meeting performance specifications. This paper will present innovative technology and apparatus to re-magnetize the de-magnetized rotors for reclaiming. The research has developed a process where, without disassembling the rotor, the magnets in the rotor are re-magnetized in-situ by a specific apparatus. Testing has proven that PMMs assembled with reclaimed rotors have the same performance-rated power and torque as those built with new rotors. On the other hand, since magnets in PMMs account for more than 50% of total carbon emission of all reclaimable parts in PMMs, factoring in mining, manufacturing, logistics, and processing of magnets that generates toxic byproducts to the environment, PMM rotor recycling contributes to corporate responsibility and our overall ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) rating. Furthermore, reclaiming PMM rotors can enable us to build PMM more cost-effectively, gain competitiveness in the market, and keep our PMM supply chain more stabilized.

Africa Journal of Management,"The challenges and opportunities facing African organizations reflect a long history of tensions, tragedies, triumphs, and accomplishments in relationships across continental boundaries. For example, Africa has long been a source of critical minerals and other raw materials that are integral to a wide range of global industries, but scholars of management have not integrated an understanding of Africa's role in global commerce fully in research on international exchange. Perhaps most importantly, scholarship in the field of management has not addressed the extensive opportunities for the development of innovative ideas, capabilities, capacities, inventions, and breakthroughs that would be made possible by international investments in human development and human capital on the continent. Resolving African problems and pursuing African opportunity requires renewed commitment by management scholars to this agenda. In this introductory article, we focus particularly on the structure of relationships across continental boundaries through global value chains (GVCs) and the role political and corporate sustainability conversations and initiatives play. We also seek to explore their implications especially for African organizations that simultaneously pursue economic growth and constructive social and environmental impact. We conclude with a framework for further study by management scholars on these important issues.","Hofstetter J.S., McGahan A.M., Silverman B.S., Zoogah B.D.",Sustainability and global value chains in Africa: Introduction to the Special Issue,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123221588&doi=10.1080%2f23322373.2021.2018220&partnerID=40&md5=6694a052f8c76eb5000a01cd7b8d6a2e
Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science,"The change in the climate conditions and the increase of the consumption with the increased population, forced change in the agricultural field. This change brings a question of how to reach enough natural products even in small areas. Vertical farming option emerged as one of the sustainable options with the short supply chain processes. Besides, it helps to decrease the effects of climate change and improve the sustainability since it utilizes less water and avoids problems such as arid soil, soil infertility etc. Technological developments started to spread rapidly in the agricultural field and led to various digital transformations according to the needs. Recently, the new concept of smart agriculture makes agriculture more efficient and effective thanks to high-precision algorithms. The most significant farming applications are irrigation management, pest and disease control, greenhouse condition monitoring, soil and water quality monitoring, precision agriculture and dairy management. In this study, machine learning methods are applied such as CNN image processing model which can detect and identifying diseases on plants. In this research, AI based lettuce diseases detection system is proposed. An AI model is developed to identify different lettuce diseases. The model was built with ResNet50 and ImageNet on Tensorflow. Various over fitting prevention methods are also applied to the model to compensate for the limited training dataset and the results of the study are discussed. It will guide people towards enhancing awareness of the importance and necessity of using various machine learning techniques and various alternatives to traditional agriculture for the sustainability.","Siropyan M., Celikel O., Pinarer O.",Artificial Intelligence Driven Vertical Farming Management System,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137079159&partnerID=40&md5=b93dde54ab7b012a9e008405ec76cb3f
Journal of Cleaner Production,"The chemical industry has growing importance in sustainability because of the potential adverse effects on the environment. Also, stakeholders emphasize many social issues besides environmental protection for the chemical industry. Relying on a solid supplier base has become the main prerequisite for chemical manufacturers to achieve environmental targets and fulfill stakeholders' expectations while remaining competitive. This study develops the Integrated Sustainable Supplier Evaluation & Development Framework (ISSED-F) to support chemical manufacturers with managing supplier relationships according to the economic, environmental, and social facets of sustainability. Although the literature is rife with evaluation models aiming to fulfill the supplier selection tasks, these models mostly ignore the developmental role of supplier evaluation. To remedy this gap, ISSED-F adopts a deductive and holistic approach from setting the criteria to setting the measurement structure, evaluating the suppliers, and developing the suppliers. Materiality analysis, Analytic Network Process (ANP), Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE), and cluster analysis are the fundamental methods that constitute the ISSED-F structure. A case study presents the use of the ISSED-F in a transnational chemical manufacturer's supplier relationship management (SRM) process. The case company evaluates 69 suppliers and assigns development strategies to the relevant performance segments within the implementation. The successful implementation of ISSED-F shows that it can be a roadmap for chemical manufacturers to adopt sustainability practices and ensure continuous development in their supply chains.","Coşkun S.S., Kumru M., Kan N.M.",An integrated framework for sustainable supplier development through supplier evaluation based on sustainability indicators,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122478238&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2021.130287&partnerID=40&md5=a785b77aa424b9708a2cdddc248c53d2
International Journal of Production Economics,"The circular economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 are both vital new perspectives in production economics and operations management. However, it remains largely unclear whether or not there are complementary effects on performance which can be achieved by adopting them together. This paper bridges this gap through an empirical study. Drawing upon the resource-based view and complementarity theory, original quantitative primary data is collected through a survey of supply chain managers working for companies operating in Brazil. The individual and joint effects on sustainability of adopting CE and Industry 4.0 technologies (including economic, environmental, and social measures) and firms’ operational performance are examined. Our original findings indicate that there is indeed a synergistic effect on performance resulting from joint adoption of CE and Industry 4.0 technologies; in addition, the isolated adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies does not affect social performance. However, through the joint adoption of CE and Industry 4.0 technologies, a positive influence on social performance is identified. This paper contributes to the literature by (i) confirming a potential synergistic effect between CE and Industry 4.0 technologies, as well as revealing their importance to business operations and social performance, and (ii) extending the contributions of previous conceptual and exploratory studies on the nexus of CE and Industry 4.0.","Lopes de Sousa Jabbour A.B., Chiappetta Jabbour C.J., Choi T.-M., Latan H.",‘Better together’: Evidence on the joint adoption of circular economy and industry 4.0 technologies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135876791&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108581&partnerID=40&md5=7b246d23c05d0d1d497ac8b961abf756

Journal of Cleaner Production,"The circular economy (CE) concepts have attained great attention to achieve sustainable development goals. However, the implementation of CE requires identifying its drivers and barriers. These drivers and barriers further require identification of the pathways to execute the implementation plan. To address this gap, this study explores the drivers and barriers of CE implementation to evaluate their cause and effect relationships and implementation pathways in the context of the Pakistani manufacturing industry – an emerging economy. The results show that resource efficiency sits at the top of the list of internal drivers. Among the external drivers, support from parent company, social responsibility, and international competition and push appear as equally important drivers of CE. The results on the external barriers show a significant role of all three barriers: lack of government policies, lack of industrial support, and lack of supply chain integration and effects of supply chain complexity. Reduction of cost exhibits its multi-faceted effect on profitability/market share and customer-supplier relationship, and lack of expertise affects profit and market demand level.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The circular economy (CE) has been proposed as a potentially significant catalyst to enhance the current response to the global climate crisis. The objective of this study was to investigate the scientific literature of the research between climate change and CE adopting a knowledge mapping approach. Based on a total of 789 peer-reviewed publications extracted from Scopus, we found that research on climate change and CE is continually growing and interdisciplinary in nature. Europe notably leads scientific production. Keyword evolution shows that CE has been influenced by more lines of research than climate change. We also found that waste management is the CE approach most associated with climate change, mitigation is the climate action most impacted by CE, and food is the most reported greenhouse gas (GHG)-emitting material. However, there are knowledge gaps in the integration of the social dimension, the promotion of climate change adaptation, and the association of sustainable development goal (SDG) 13. Finally, we identified four potentially valuable directions for future studies: (i) CE practices, (ii) bioeconomy, (iii) climate and energy, and (iv) sustainability and natural resources, in which carbon recovery technologies, green materials, regional supply chains, circular agriculture models, and nature-based solutions are promising themes.","Romero-Perdomo F., Carvajalino-Umaña J.D., Moreno-Gallego J.L., Ardila N., González-Curbelo M.Á.",Research Trends on Climate Change and Circular Economy from a Knowledge Mapping Perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122202701&doi=10.3390%2fsu14010521&partnerID=40&md5=9c915117303520c56275a661eea05318
Journal of Developing Societies,"The circular economy (CE) is a topic of growing interest, spurred by climate change and increasing recognition of the considerable costs of energy and materials waste, that reflect increasing stress on global environmental systems. Those costs range from physical landfill expenses to effects on human and natural world health. While there are a growing number of articles about the CE, there remains a great deal of ambiguity around pathways to implement it, and even fewer practical examples. Lieder and Rashid (2016) conclude in their overarching examination of CE research that while it is broad and multidisciplinary it is also fragmented, highly granular, and “rarely touching implementation.” In this article, we review recent efforts to identify models for scaling up circular economy practices in specific sectors of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia economies, based on information produced by the Sustainable Manufacturing and Environmental Pollution (SMEP) program. The SMEP program has been established by the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and is being implemented in partnership with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). SMEP seeks to reduce pollution in manufacturing in the Global South. After a brief discussion of the CE concept, this article focuses on the innovative features of the SMEP program, its preliminary findings and lessons for the transition to circularity.","Hira A., Pacini H., Attafuah-Wadee K., Hassall J.",Sustainable Manufacturing and Environmental Pollution Programme (SMEP): A Circular Economy Experiment in the Global South,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133494275&doi=10.1177%2f0169796X221106013&partnerID=40&md5=8c3d8c1cb7ebb7ef17a6981be7721f7b
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"The circular economy (CE) paradigm aims to prevent environmental degradation while ensuring the economic and social well-being of the present and future generations. Recently, the CE has garnered rising interest from academics, managers, and policymakers, especially in the food sector. The CE can not only open up avenues for waste reduction, but the corporate players in the food sector also look forward to a CE to enhance customers' loyalty and trust. This paper maps the relatively novel but growing CE and food literature territory by systematically reviewing the studies. The analysis is carried out by integrating different interdisciplinary perspectives that lead to essential themes and sub-themes. The findings include that food waste management is a prominent theme in conjunction with the CE, followed by food packaging, resource nexus, policies and legislation, CE performance, CE principles in the food supply chain, transition challenges, and CE rebound & circular premium.

International Journal of Production Research,"The circular economy (CE) seeks to maintain products and materials at their highest utility and value. The organisational and governmental policy have seised onto the CE philosophy to advance socio-economic and environmental development. CE remains an essentially contested concept – making its utilisation as a foundation for managerial and policy decisions challenging. Circularity assessment has not been systematically adopted, especially within supply chain management. Using critical scholarly and practical evidential foundation, we proposed a comprehensive set of metrics that can be utilised in supplier selection, monitoring, and development for circularity. These metrics include the macro, meso, and micro levels.

The proposed BWM-DHFE-RT integrative analytical method can accommodate decisionmaker psychological behaviour under uncertainty while simultaneously capturing divergent or conflicting opinions of different decision-makers.

The most influential stakeholder classes for overcoming the barriers are consumers, industry leaders, and governments. Circumventing measures lie in sustainable end-of-life product and waste management, resource circularity, modularity and standardization in design, and supply chain collaboration.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"The circular economy has been proposed to transform global textile supply chains which are currently challenged by a complex nexus of sustainability issues related to the dominant fast fashion trend. Research on circular economy in the textile sector often focuses on businesses or consumers as key enablers in circular transitions, yet it treats them as independent entities and thereby neglects the study of interactions that can provide insight at the systems level. The proclaimed “circular textile mission” in the Netherlands setting a national target for 100% circularity by 2050 is used as case study to address this research gap. We explore the circular textile transition processes found in the context of the Dutch mission and compare the development and interactions among various technical and non-technological solutions produced by engaged actor constellations for assessing key factors driving and blocking the overall mission fulfilment. To these ends, we derive a theoretical framework based on innovation system theory and conceptualize the Dutch circular textile transition as a Mission-oriented Innovation System (MIS). Analyzing the structure and functioning of the Dutch mission-oriented innovation system, we show that (1) there is a good match between the formal Dutch circular textile mission and system actor perceptions; (2) system actors have formed structures around three dominant solution trajectories in the Dutch system: secondhand, mechanical recycling, and chemical recycling; (3) these trajectories expose distinct key virtuous and vicious cycles, which characterize (4) the entire system as formative. Overall, the secondhand trajectory shows most developed structures and most positive dynamics, chemical recycling carries most technological breakthrough potential, whereas mechanical recycling is a mature technology but lacks market demand and supply. We compare the three solution trajectories, discuss the disruptive nature of the Dutch circular textile transition, and suggest installing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) as a potential intervention for accelerating system transformation.

International Journal of Production Economics,"The circular economy is an important part of sustainable business around the world. Accordingly, this study focuses on developing a sustainable framework for multi-echelon multiple electronics products' closed-loop supply chain in the e-commerce industry toward the circular economy. The proposed framework captures the complexities associated with forward and reverse logistics. The order is picked up from the supplier and delivered to the customer in the forward flow. Return products are picked up from customer locations and delivered to the inspection centre in the reverse flow. During the inspection process, products are classified into three categories: Reselling, Refurbishing, and Recycling (3R). The products that can be resold, refurbished, and recycled are then delivered to their respective final destinations, i.e., the supplier's warehouse, the refurbishing centre, and the recycling centre, respectively. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is developed to reduce total cost and maximize revenue associated with the forward and reverse flow of goods in a closed-loop supply chain while prioritising sustainability. To achieve this, a global solver in the LINGO 19 package software is used to solve and generate the exact solutions of the model. We have conducted 15 computational experiments for small-to-medium-to-large-sized problems to test the model. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to analyze the effect on total expected revenue from sustainable Closed-loop Supply Chain (CLSC) of variations in the major parameters of the model.

Central European Business Review,"The circular economy is presented as the sustainable solution as opposed to the current linear model of production and resource management, whose effects impact negatively on the economic, social and environmental dimensions. Through a systematic review of the literature, this article aims to unify and to uncover the available evidence on innovation in relation to the circular economy and to determine those aspects that remain unexplored or should be studied in more depth in order to be able to continue to make progress in this field. Thus, it was found that although the circular economy is at an early stage of implementation, both its benefits and drivers as well as its challenges and barriers to implementation have already been investigated. More importantly, it was found that ecological innovations, which reduce the environmental impact of production and consumption activities, are necessary for the research of new business models and new ways of operating in supply chains that allow closing the circle and taking advantage of all the waste, such as the system of products and services, dynamic capabilities, 3D printing, the biography of the product and the software recycling.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"The circular economy seeks to reduce waste by reusing, refurbishing, and recycling used products. It increases the resource value of used goods. In this study, we proposed a circular business gap exploiter model in which a re-commerce company exploits residual value in product systems utilization. A game-theoretic approach is used to investigate the coordination problem of a two-echelon circular supply chain with e-commerce and re-commerce companies. In addition, we proposed a coordinated structure under the revenue sharing contract and the two-part tariff contract through Nash negotiation to address the coordination problems. We compared the centralized and decentralized model findings and observed that the decentralized model shows potential for improvement. We showed model's applicability through numerical examples and sensitivity analysis to indicate how parameters such as wholesale price and retail price affect channel decisions and member profits.

This study uses data-driven analysis to clarify circular supply chain trends and opportunities in practice. A valid hierarchical circular supply chain structure is composed of a big dataset. However, the attributes of the hierarchical circular supply chain structure must be explored to identify the opportunities and challenges of the circular supply chain.

Palgrave Studies in Sustainable Business in Association with Future Earth,"The climate is already changing, making climate change adaptation (CCA) an essential component of any sustainable development strategy. Similarly, the capacities of different actors to adapt to climate change are significantly affected by social and economic factors including nutrition, health, and employment. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) characterize progress toward the aforementioned factors as well as CCA through targets under SDG 13 (Climate Action). More recently, the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR) illustrates the interactions within and between SDGs, showing how many other SDGs influence progress toward CCA and vice versa. Businesses need to be mindful of these complex interdependencies when developing risk management, supply chain management, and sustainability strategies to make effective contributions to CCA while avoiding ineffective or maladaptive strategies. In this chapter, we demonstrate these interdependencies by modeling the interactions defined in the 2019 GSDR using the cross-impact balances (CIB) method, which identifies self-reinforcing scenarios and traces the systemic effects of interventions. We focus our analysis on how existing global business priorities may push the system toward certain scenarios over others, centering the implications for CCA. Through our analysis, we find six self-reinforcing scenarios for global SDGs, half of which indicate progress in CCA. We also identify six SDGs that appear critical to achieving all SDGs, highlighting gaps in current business efforts and areas for additional focus. Among these critical SDGs is SDG 13 (Climate Action), reaffirming the importance of CCA in progress toward sustainable development.","Lazurko A., Kearney N.M., Siddhantakar N., Kurniawan J.H., Schweizer V.",Weaknesses in Corporate Commitments to Climate Change Adaptation and How to Fix Them: A Systemic Scenario Assessment Approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126438454&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-86803-1_6&partnerID=40&md5=6214bfec1145fe3184d9c80cb28bf90c
Journal of Industrial and Production Engineering,"The closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) is the supply chain that includes various recovery plans for used products to be reused in the industry. Most of the previous stochastic CLSC studies considered the effect of uncertain parameter changes on the economic aspect only, while the other sustainability aspects were neglected. The purpose of this study is to develop a realistic mathematical model that represents and analyzes the impact of uncertainty in demand and recovery rate of products on the economic, environmental, and social sustainability aspects in the CLSC. The objective functions were optimized using the constrained optimization by linear approximation (COBYLA) algorithm along with preference-based Pareto optimal solution set algorithm at multiple computations to optimize various objectives simultaneously and efficiently. The results show a significant correlation between demand uncertainty, rate of return uncertainty, and the sustainability objectives in the CLSC using optimal inventory management settings.","Elfarouk O., Wong K.Y., Wong W.P.","Multi-objective optimization for multi-echelon, multi-product, stochastic sustainable closed-loop supply chain",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113802582&doi=10.1080%2f21681015.2021.1963338&partnerID=40&md5=c68a5f12e25c5f29adf06d0753bec711
IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,"The concept of circular economy (CE) has gained prominence in management research as a new industrial approach that society, companies, and policymakers should follow in aiming to manage for sustainability issues. The adoption of CE principles has highlighted particular managerial practices that companies can implement in their business models. However, existing research still falls short of describing in sufficient detail the enablers of these practices for a circular business model design. This issue, especially in rural areas, is particularly interesting for the agri-food sector, which is characterized by enormous sustainability challenges, including food production and waste, packaging, transportation, consumer habits and behavior, and energy production and consumption. This article takes stock of this gap through an analysis of the enablers of managerial practices in Fiusis, a company operating in the agro-energy sector of a rural area, which has designed a circular business model and was recognized as &#x201C;the best business model in the rural area&#x201D; by the European Commission in 2019. The case highlights the importance of a suitable political and institutional environment beneficial to the starting-up and development of the business, and the importance of collaborating within the community of stakeholders for the creation of a new culture of sustainability.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"The concept of sustainable development is becoming incomprehensible and complex in global supply networks, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) that are most affected by ever-changing industry challenges and standards. Smart technologies emerged by Industry 4.0, sustainability, and circular economy (CE) connection, which remain unexplored, can be integrated into the supply chain as a business strategy to increase collaboration and cooperation between different tiers of the supply chain to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) according to LMIC. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to discover the drivers of a smart sustainable circular supply chain (SSCSC) in achieving the SDGs in LMIC through stakeholder theory. First, a systematic review is employed to identify the drivers of the SSCSC to achieve the SDGs in the LMIC incorporating existing literature on the subject. Second, the Best-Worst Method (BWM) is applied to analyze the identified drivers, and then the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to analyze the SDGs. The applicability of the solution methodology was illustrated by providing a numerical example. The results of the study are twofold: firstly, drivers are analyzed by implementation of BWM. The results of the BWM reveal that economic sustainability is the best key driver among the eight driversin achieving the SDGs, meaning that without financial assistance and support achieving the SDGs becomes ineffective. Secondly, the TOPSIS analysis reveals that SDG 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions) is the SDG most supported by drivers.","Kayikci Y., Kazancoglu Y., Gozacan-Chase N., Lafci C.",Analyzing the drivers of smart sustainable circular supply chain for sustainable development goals through stakeholder theory,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127735593&doi=10.1002%2fbse.3087&partnerID=40&md5=873832f7bda24c24571876e35343717a
Understanding Complex Systems,"The concepts of sustainability and supply chains are critical components for modern businesses as they face enormous competition and manage economic, social, and environmental sustainability. However, the poultry livestock sub-sector has received insufficient attention from academics, according to current literature. As a result, this particular industry is suffering from unstructured supply chain processes, a lack of awareness of the implications of the sustainability concept, and a failure to recycle poultry wastes. Furthermore, the Covid 19 pandemic puts additional strain on this industry and its supply chain. As a result, the current study uses a case study to develop an integrated poultry forward supply chain model. The integration process model is an expanded version derived from real-world scattered processes performed by various supply chain members. With the help of ‘system dynamics’ and case study method, this quantitative study used the positivist paradigm and ‘design science’ methodology. The findings revealed that supply chain integration could provide economic and social sustainability and a structured manufacturing process to support the research objectives and questions.

International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing,"The concepts of sustainable supply chains and Industry 4.0 are progressively getting attention in different domains. Companies have started developing and implementing these practices in their business models. However, several challenges influence the adoption of sustainability and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This study aimed (i) to identify the adoption barriers of sustainability and I4.0 and (ii) to establish the interrelationship among these barriers for SMEs. An extensive literature search supported by interviews with supply chain practitioners from three SMEs identified 12 critical barriers to adoption. The barriers are then ranked using ‘Interpretive Structural Modeling’. The results suggest that the ‘lack of resources’ and the ‘lack of employee’s competence/expertise’ are the most influencing barriers. Changing government regulations on the allocation of capital and financial incentives for SMEs to encourage training and skills development programs could promote sustainable supply chains and practices.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The construction industry plays an essential role in economic development since it is one of the largest industries all over the world. Blockchain has the potential to reshape the structure of all accessible networks in the future. Construction businesses are increasingly interested in embracing blockchain technology to improve supply chain sustainability performance and supply chain resilience in times of globally increasing risks and volatility. This study evaluates the readiness of actors involved in the producing of concrete goods to emphasize the necessity to bring blockchain into the construction industry, as it may be a solution for supply chain resilience and long-term sustainable growth. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in collecting and analyzing the data and testing the hypotheses. Data were collected using an online questionnaire distributed to 300 employees who work within the biggest concrete producing companies in Saudi Arabia. 120 respondents completed the questionnaires. Additionally, confirmatory semi-structured interviews with experts in supply chain financing, IT departments, and procurement departments have been conducted; the study’s findings revealed a low level of blockchain knowledge within Saudi Arabia’s construction industry, since (90%) of respondents have not worked with Blockchain technology. Several technologists barely understand it, and the level of readiness is very low. How-ever, there is a lot of potential, and it is worth investing in it combined with other technologies such as BIM technology. In this study, the authors have sought to provide a measure of Saudi professionals’ attitudes and understanding of blockchain technology solutions within the construction industry in Saudi Arabia.

Buildings,"The construction industry, as one of the most complex sectors, depends on using wasted and recycled materials, timely decision-making, and adequate execution of all activities in supply chains. This paper presents tests of mixtures for cold in-place recycling where existing material is used. In this research, we used cement and bitumen emulsion as well as fly ash, zeolite, slag, and Bakelite. A total of seven mixtures were tested in order to increase sustainability. It was tested the indirect tensile strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity after seven and 28 days for dry specimens, after 28 days for water-saturated specimens and for specimens exposed to frost. After completing the tests using the MEREC (MEthod based on the Removal Effects of Criteria) and CoCoSo (Combined Compromise Solution) multi-criteria model, mixtures were evaluated and ranked in terms of mechanical properties, price, and environmental protection. Considering the ranking of mixtures using the CoCoSo method, the highest quality mixtures, for most combinations of weight factors, are mixtures with slag, mixtures with fly ash, and mixtures with 2% of cement and 2% of bitumen emulsion. Sensitivity analysis was also performed with new simulated values of the criteria in order to determine the individual influence of the criteria on the ranking of mixtures. The conclusions are as follows: the use of bitumen emulsion, cement, waste materials, and other materials in cold recycling would reduce the cost of recycling pavement structures, increase environmental protection, while the mechanical properties of the pavement structures are within acceptable limits.","Marinković M., Zavadskas E.K., Matić B., Jovanović S., Das D.K., Sremac S.",Application of Wasted and Recycled Materials for Production of Stabilized Layers of Road Structures,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129750467&doi=10.3390%2fbuildings12050552&partnerID=40&md5=e5037d2706ba202081252360f65a2e84
Frontiers in Built Environment,"The construction industry’s inherent fragmentation fuels Construction Supply Chain (CSC) complexity. Logistics form an essential part of the CSC in terms of costs and project management. In turn, transportation accounts for more than half the logistics costs due to construction materials being low-cost/high-volume, and most other logistics processes being business processes and not physical ones. Construction transport is almost entirely road bound, one of the least sustainable modes with externalities far out of proportion to its numbers. Ergo, its optimisation presents substantial greening (de-carbonisation) opportunity, with potentially far-reaching sustainability impacts. The ASI (Avoid-Shift-Improve) concept considers activity, modal structure, and energy intensity/efficiency as transport carbon components, providing a fundamental optimisation framework. 93% of New Zealand’s freight (a third of it construction related) is road bound, with 99% fossil-fuel (diesel) dependence. Government adoption of ASI elements viz Supply Chain (SC) efficiency, transport optimisation, data/information sharing, and collaboration for transport decarbonisation aligns with Industry 5.0, but seeks further research for concrete implementation pathways.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The construction sector and concomitant supply chain has been acknowledged in the literature as a major contributor to environmental “stress”, from the design, sourcing and extraction of raw materials through to transportation, design, construction and demolition. Clear indicators/solutions have been showcased as vehicles for reducing this stress, ranging from lifecycle costing through to waste reduction strategies, carbon assessment and “green” environmental assessment tools to name but a few. However, this paper argues that whilst some of these (intervention strategies) may have had some positive effects, the main challenge rests with people—inter alia, the key decision-makers and leadership structures with the “position power” to effect change. Acknowledging this as a supposition, this paper uses three discreet construction organisations engaging in offsite construction as a micro-study (cf. cross-case study) to evaluate sustainability perceptions. In doing so, it focuses specifically on sustainability practices and business processes underpinning technology (adoption, absorption and diffusion), including the perceptions of different stakeholders involved in each of these three companies. In total, 30 respondents from three organisations (cases) participated in this study, representing three tiers of management (top, middle and first line). Priority areas are high-lighted, along with the reasons supporting these perspectives. Findings from this work present a new technology diffusion sustainability model for offsite construction. This model identifies sustainability causal links, super catalysts, actuators, barriers, forces and facilitators. More importantly perhaps, this work presents a clear case for “conjoined thinking” in order to instill a collective mindset change and common purpose for those wishing to evidence offsite sustainability.","Ezcan V., Goulding J.S.",Offsite Sustainability—Disentangling the Rhetoric through Informed Mindset Change,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128985351&doi=10.3390%2fsu14084606&partnerID=40&md5=eb66e12e55b7c58080f4a57aa553d604
Journal of Cleaner Production,"The construction sector has suffered from low productivity and considerable wastes due to the fragmentation of its value chain, the large number of diverse stakeholders and the complex nature of the projects. A promising way to reduce construction wastes and encourage value chain integration is to implement circular economy (CE) strategies. Many recent studies in the fields of construction management and sustainability have advanced CE from multiple perspectives. There remains room to refine such knowledge by clearly identifying all the possible strategies and drivers to be carried out in practice that help stakeholders slow, narrow, and close resource loops. A systematic review was conducted in this study to examine the relevant literature on construction circularity to address the knowledge gap. A total of 61 relevant publications in the past ten years were rigorously selected and reviewed in-depth based on an iterative coding procedure. The phase-specific circular economy strategies were classified into five categories: 1) Design phase (including design with LCA, design with reused materials, design with recycled materials, and design for disassembly); 2) Manufacturing phase (including industrial symbiosis); 3) Construction phase (including lean construction methods); 4) Operation and maintenance phase (including service life planning); and 5) End-of-Life phase (including diversion of wastes). Internal drivers were identified to consist of BIM (Building Information Modelling)-based design and evaluation, IoT (Internet of Things)-based material tracking, predictive data analytics, and logistics network optimization. External drivers included material certifications and legislation, financial incentives, market maturity and material flow balance, and social engagement. The review revealed that the BIM-based and LCA-based methods have been widely used; however, logistics network optimization to allow industrial symbiosis was not adequately addressed in the existing literature. The strategies and drivers were also composed into a framework to guide the future implementation of circular construction projects. The framework could help construction researchers and project participants clearly understand circular resource flows across various construction supply chain stages and thus help them to keep up with the global action of “Net Zero Emission” by 2050.","Chen Q., Feng H., Garcia de Soto B.",Revamping construction supply chain processes with circular economy strategies: A systematic literature review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122218221&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2021.130240&partnerID=40&md5=a9204a61828edf902ddbcc4c5a1ed1d4

Sustainable Alternatives for Aviation Fuels,"The continuous and rapid development of the aviation industry will result in excessive greenhouse gas emissions and overreliance on conventional fuels. Therefore, the search for alternative aviation fuels has drawn more and more attention from countries around the world. Biojet fuels have been an attractive alternative to aviation fuels because it has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. A complete life cycle assessment usually requires the construction of the entire product supply chain, which is known as a cradle-to-grave analysis. This chapter summarizes the biomass feedstocks available for aviation fuel and their conversion paths. Next, the technical economic and environmental impact of biojet fuel are reviewed from the perspective of the life cycle. The results show that hydrogenated esters and fatty acids, and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis technology are the most promising biojet fuel production technologies in the near future. At present, the development of biojet fuel still faces some challenges, including the availability, economy of scale, and sustainability of feedstock, which make it unable to be applied on a large scale.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The continuous decline in the sustainable agro-food supply chain (AFSC) towards a Circular Economy (CE) has become a matter of great concern for the key stakeholders, including government organizations, businesses, end-users, and farmers. In line with this, the main purpose of this study is to develop a sustainable food Supply Chain Network (SCN). The SCN enables the collection of agro-food grains from different farmers’ locations and delivers the same to food processing units. To design an efficient and effective sustainable pickup and delivery network, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) mathematical model is formulated. The proposed model achieves the sustainability goal by minimizing the collection costs. The developed MINLP model is solved by using an exact optimization approach in LINGO 18 software. Further, to test the efficacy of the developed model, various computational experiments are performed, varying from small to large size data.

Thus, this paper investigates how the pandemic has challenged the UK's development status by analysing how the pandemic has impacted the country's food industry. A literature review was conducted and used to identify, select and critically appraise publications between 2000 and 2021 discussing the challenges in the UK food system. The findings reveal that the UK's food industry is unsustainable as there are significant flaws in the system, that is food insecurity and food waste that go unaddressed. The impact of the pandemic has exacerbated the social and economic impacts of operating with such a system. Compounded with the geopolitical adjustments caused by Brexit, the UK is faced with the challenge of restructuring and developing new frameworks such as policies, regulations, schemes and partnerships to support the food industry's sustainability. Lastly, the findings reinforce that ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ nations encounter similar food challenges, which manifest differently in various landscapes and contexts. Therefore, the world (not just the UK) needs to shift away from Eurocentrism, moving towards a universal but equally personalised development outlook.

Research in Transportation Economics,"The COVID-19 pandemic affected many supply chains worldwide, including the Brazilian green-fuel ethanol supply chain. Our analysis considered sustainability variables (social, environmental, and economic) to investigate the pandemic's effects on the ethanol industries of 15 ethanol producing Brazilian states, comparing data from 2020 to 2019 and applying a novel Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA): the Double Frontier Slack-Based Measure Malmquist Productivity Index (DF-SBM MPI). The findings show that all states suffered negative impacts from the pandemic and some incurred a risk of collapsing it. The least negatively impacted states were São Paulo and Mato Grosso. São Paulo's ethanol sector is a benchmark for income derived from trade in carbon-credits by RenovaBio certified mills, while Mato Grosso's sector is able to take advantage of the largest spread between ethanol and gasoline prices, certainly a competitive advantage for ethanol producers. We recommend the implementation of public policies to support, mainly, the most affected states by assisting their mills to become environmentally certified participants to take advantage of income opportunities available in the carbon-credit trading market.

Starting March 2020, given the skyrocketing prices of PPE in the open market, healthcare institutions were confronted with the dire need to reshape their PPE procurement strategy. One avenue that financially constrained healthcare institutions pursued were donation platforms that offered access to donated PPE by individuals and organizations. We document a real-life case study of one of the most prominent donor platforms that emerged during this period: Get Us PPE. From 20 March 2020 to 2 July 2021, Get Us PPE received 23,001 total individual requests for PPE from every US state and some US territories. In response to these 23,001 requests, Get Us PPE delivered 17,540,571 units of PPE. The number of PPE units delivered was still less than 25% of the total units of PPE requested, indicating the enormity of the PPE shortage. Using this case study, we identify key supply chain issues that manifest during emergencies and highlight the formation of a platform ecosystem to resolve these issues. We also observed a robust supply chain network design that addresses key supply chain sustainability metrics such as minimizing material waste and transportation miles, while balancing other stakeholder factors such as donor and recipient characteristics as well as shipment complexity. We argue that the roadmap followed by Get Us PPE could serve as a template for organizations that emerge in the context of future humanitarian crises.","Bala R., Sarangee K.R., He S., Jin G.",Get Us PPE: A Self-Organizing Platform Ecosystem for Supply Chain Optimization during COVID-19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126307270&doi=10.3390%2fsu14063175&partnerID=40&md5=8530017a806619638345cda7ecf038cb
Mathematics,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all sectors of the world’s economy and society. Firms need to have disaster recovery and business sustainability plans and to be able to generate profits in order to develop. Trade credit may be a good way for firms to free up cash flow and finance short-term growth. Extensions of payment will provide firms with low-cost loans under the COVID-19 credit guarantee scheme. Implementation of hybrid trade credit activities has been shown to improve the financial crisis of many firms, and the effects are particularly evident within two-echelon supply chains. An economic order quantity (EOQ) model is derived under conditions of deteriorating items, an upstream full trade credit or cash discount, and downstream partial trade credit in a supply chain. A computer program is developed to provide a numerical solution and a numerical example is used to show the solution’s form and verify that the solution gives the minimum total cost per unit time.","Ruan P., Huang Y.-F., Weng M.-W.",Impact of COVID-19 on Supply Chains: A Hybrid Trade Credit Policy,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128759413&doi=10.3390%2fmath10081209&partnerID=40&md5=6d26eed668fc24119e32b205398493ca
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought global economies to a standstill and created challenges for a variety of sectors, including housing, building and infrastructure. Many business and government organisations have experienced some form of supply chain disruption—either through suppliers going offline, a sudden spike in demand or both. While embedding sustain-ability in procurement is a powerful tool for bringing about positive change in an organisation’s supply chains, this global pandemic has had a myriad of impacts on these procurement processes. Through focus group discussions with industrial practitioners and government decision makers from the Australian built environment sector, this study presents their lived experiences related to COVID-19 impacts on sustainable procurement. The emergent themes are: (1) the effects of COVID-19 on sustainable procurement, (2) the rapid development of reactive procurement responses and (3) levers for post-COVID-19 sustainable procurement. In order to learn from the challenges related to COVID-19, both government and industry need to re-assess their supply chain risks and determine the supply chain design that will deliver the most resiliency in the event of another large-scale disruption. There are several key levers, including developing reliable, trans-parent and local supply chains, leveraging innovative tools and digital engineering approaches, creating a coalition between government and industry and assessing risks at multiple levels. This study is the first of its kind to evaluate the COVID-19 impacts on sustainable procurement in the Australian building and construction industries. Government and industry practitioners can immediately apply these actionable recommendations to overcome the impacts of the pandemic and other disruptions on sustainable procurement activities.","Caldera S., Mohamed S., Feng Y.",Evaluating the COVID-19 Impacts on Sustainable Procurement: Experiences from the Australian Built Environment Sector,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128175759&doi=10.3390%2fsu14074163&partnerID=40&md5=1f5b2350864c6e0efeb94293f4b46743
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a confounding collection of transportation, supply chains, and logistical disruptions, which needs to be well addressed by businesses and governments. During this pandemic, several researchers have concentrated on the sustainability and resilience of supply chains in various industry sectors. Nevertheless, the impacts of the pandemic on sustainability pillars, technological change and uncertainties, and resilience approaches in various sectors have not been clarified yet. More specifically, the agricultural biomass sector has experienced serious disruptions induced by the COVID-19. This paper aims to analyze and assess the agricultural biomass supply and production systems during the COVID-19 and their recovery in post-COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the economic, environmental, social, and technological change effects of the COVID-19 on Biomass Supply Chain resilience. Uncertainties of oil and palm energy demand, price, consumption, export, and production of leading producers and suppliers worldwide are analyzed considering the pre-COVID-19 and current COVID-19 period. It is then followed by recommendations for specific strategies, policies for the biomass industry, and general action plan to overcome the problems of resilience in medium, short, and long-term horizon plans. The findings from this study are valuable resources for the governments, biomass industry, and other stakeholders to provide cleaner post-pandemic energy production and supply and enhance the employees’ engagement.","Zahraee S.M., Shiwakoti N., Stasinopoulos P.","Agricultural biomass supply chain resilience: COVID-19 outbreak vs. sustainability compliance, technological change, uncertainties, and policies",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130312155&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2022.100049&partnerID=40&md5=b3be5597be788e2d06c8ea7d914f1739
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of global manufacturing companies to their supply chains and operating activities as one of the significant disruption events of the past two decades. It has demonstrated that major companies underestimate the need for sustainable and resilient operations. The pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions especially in the automotive industry. The goal of the study is to determine impact of the COVID-19 on supply chain operations in a Turkish automotive manufacturer and to develop a framework for improving operational activities to survive in the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) environment. The study identifies how the case study company has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and what challenges the company faced during the pandemic. A diagnostic survey and semi-structured interviews were used as data sources with qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results showed that the pandemic led to significant disruptions through various factors explained by shortage of raw materials/spare parts, availability of transportation, availability of labors, demand fluctuations, increase in sick leaves, new health and safety regulations. Findings also show the necessity to re-design resilience supply chain management by providing recovery plans (forecasting, supplier selection, simulation, monitoring) which consider different measures in different stages. In addition, the best practices were recommended for the case study by considering internal, external, and technological challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the given targeted guidelines and improvement for the automotive company might be applicable in the industrial practices for other organizations.

Energies,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the supply chains of traditional fossil fuels. According to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) from 2020, oil-refining activity fell by more than the IEA had anticipated. It was also assumed that the demand in 2021 would likely be 2.6 million bpd below the 2019 levels. However, renewable markets have shown strong resilience during the crisis. It was determined that renewables are on track to meet 80% of the growth in electricity demand over the next 10 years and that sustainable energy will act as the primary source of electricity production instead of coal. On the other hand, the report also emphasized that measures for reducing environmental pollution and CO2 emissions are still insufficient and that significant current investments should be further expanded.

All around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic affects different dimensions of SCs, including but not limited to finance, lead time, demand changes, and production performance. There is an urgent need to respond to this grand challenge. The catastrophic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted scholars to develop innovative SC disruption management strategies and disseminate them via numerous scientific articles. However, there is still a lack of systematic literature survey studies that aim to identify promising SC disruption management strategies through the bibliometric, network, and thematic analyses. In order to address this drawback, this study presents a set of up-to-date bibliometric, network, and thematic analyses to identify the influential contributors, main research streams, and disruption management strategies related to the SC performance under the COVID-19 settings. The conducted analyses reveal that resilience and sustainability are the primary SC topics. Furthermore, the major research themes are found to be food, health-related SCs, and technology-aided tools (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), and blockchains). Various disruption management strategies focusing on resilience and sustainability themes are extracted from the most influential studies that were identified as a part of this work.

Annals of Operations Research,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a slew of new business practices that have put the society and environment under strain. This has drawn the attention of supply chain researchers working to address the COVID-19 pandemic's looming social sustainability issues. Prior literature has indicated that collaborative relationships improve organizational performance. Over the past years, problems related to justice are reported (e.g., between Walmart Canada and the Lego group), which might negatively affect the buyer–supplier relationship. In the new normal, the effect of justice on collaborative buyer–supplier relationships on social sustainability in the COVID-19 context is obviously essential but under-explored. The current study examines buyer–supplier collaborative relationships' influence on social sustainability under the moderating effect of justice and big data analytical intelligence. In this paper, we employ the stakeholder resource-based view, loose coupling theory, and resource dependency theory as the theoretical lens to establish the research hypotheses. Using primary survey data collected from supply chain practitioners in South Africa, hypothesis testing is done using a covariance-based structural equation modelling technique. To enhance research rigor, we have checked the dyadic perspectives of both buyers and suppliers. Our empirical results reveal that collaborative buyer–supplier relationships positively influence supplier social sustainability in the new normal era. However, it is relatively stronger from the suppliers’ perspective when compared with the buyers’ perspective. Secondly, the moderating effect of perceptions of organizational justice and big data analytical intelligence on the relationship between collaborative buyer–supplier relationships and supplier social sustainability is also statistically significant. However, it is relatively stronger from the buyers’ perspective when compared with the suppliers’ perspective. These are major findings of this study.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a strict 100-day lockdown period in Spring of 2020 in China. One of the consequences of the lockdown was the disruption of the food supply chain for the millions of people confined to their homes. The well-established online food delivery service (OFDS) in China were disrupted by pressure to scale up rapidly to resolve the last mile of food delivery. The importance of the OFDS during periods of crises became apparent, as did the realization that uninterrupted food distribution was only possible due to the presence and scalability of the existing delivery network. Focusing on the importance of an established OFDS as a foundation for food distribution, this paper seeks to explore factors that affect consumers’ perception and acceptance of the retail food delivery system in urban China. By applying the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB), mean value calculation, univariate linear regression, and multiple linear regression have been adopted to test the hypotheses. Data obtained online from 260 participants demonstrate that the software’s characteristics concerning hedonic motivation (HM), convenience motivation (CM), perceived ease of use (PEOU), navigational design (ND), information quality (IQ), privacy and security (PS), restaurant credibility (RC), and perceived severity (Psev) have positive and significant impacts on customers’ intention to use (ITU), and thus, affects the actual use (AU) of the application in a positive way. The findings of this research contribute to the existing literature by consolidating, validating, and extending the TPB model, especially under the large-scale public health crisis circumstances.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"The current emerging economy of the leather industry is primarily linear. Increasingly rigorous legislative specifications for environmental preservation in developed countries have created huge pressure for the leather industry. In light of international efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a circular bioeconomy approach has gained compelling traction in addressing waste management challenges in the leather industry. The concept of circular bioeconomy encourages recycling of wastes yielded from leather processing. However, as of now, there is still a lack of research on bioeconomy concepts in the leather industry context. Hence, the purpose of this study is to put forth the antecedents for circular bioeconomy practices (BEP) in the leather processing industry (LPI), along which a firm can enhance its sustainability. Seventeen antecedents of BEP have been identified from the extensive literature review and experts survey; and their effects on each other are assessed using a blended grey based decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory model. Four major antecedents such as sustainable infrastructure for leather industry, biodiversity, advancement in sustainable products, sustainability threshold levels for bioeconomy technologies are identified as the most crucial key antecedents for BEP in the context of the LPI. In the present study, six antecedents are identified as causal, whereas eleven antecedents are identified as effect group antecedents. The sustainable infrastructure for leather industry is identified as the most crucial driving antecedent in ensuring circular BEP.

Electronics (Switzerland),"The decision-making of sustainable supply chain network (SSCN) design is a strategy capacity for configuring network facility and product flow. When optimizing conflicting economic, environmental, and social performance objectives, it is difficult to select the optimal scheme from obtained feasible decision schemes. In this article, according to the triple bottom line of sustainability, a multi-objective sustainable supply chain network optimization model is developed, and a novel performance-oriented optimization framework is proposed. This framework, referred to as performance-oriented optimization framework, integrates multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms and entropy-weighted technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (EW-TOPSIS). The optimization framework can comprehensively evaluate the performance of overall SSCN by EW-TOPSIS and guide the evolution process of algorithms. In this framework, decision-makers can obtain the feasible schemes calculated by meta-heuristics and determine the optimal one according to the performance value evaluated by EW-TOPSIS. This article combines three performance evaluation strategies with four meta-heuristic algorithms, namely, non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-2), multi-objective differential evolutionary (MODE), multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), and multi-objective gray wolr optimization (MOGWO), for verifying the effectiveness of the performance-oriented optimization framework. The results validate that the proposed framework has much better sustainability performance than the traditional optimization algorithms and evaluation methods.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"The deep tillage of soil consumes fuel at higher costs, which creates a large amount of carbon emissions. For large-scale farming in particular, the threat to the environment cannot be ignored. Currently, very few studies have considered the impact of the size of the deep tillage area on carbon emissions. Effectively controlling the size of the deep tillage area can reduce the emission of carbon dioxide at a certain level and optimize profits, which is crucial to the sustainable development of agricultural supply chains. In this paper, we design a new contract-farming rice supply chain network based on “Cooperative + Storage Company”, which considers tillage as the start point for the supply chain echelon. A multi-product, multi-period, bi-objective optimization model is proposed to maximize profit and minimize carbon emissions in the network. Moreover, we consider the grain rotation task of the storage company in the modeling. The Lp-metrics method is used to solve the bi-objective model. Subsequently, an actual scenario is used to verify the effectiveness of the model. The results indicate that changes in the size of the deep tillage area have a significant impact on carbon emissions, and the size of the deep tillage area is negatively correlated with the total farm size, thereby affecting the carbon dioxide release. The results also indicate that carbon emissions can be minimized by increasing the number of cooperatives or expanding the size of farms. The proposed model can aid decision-makers in selecting an optimal set of solutions based on their preferences or policies.","Li J., Fang Y., Yang J.",Minimizing carbon emissions of the rice supply chain considering the size of deep tillage lands,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120344810&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2021.11.022&partnerID=40&md5=a5e317dc91dc20dc51173ded9e695f19
International Journal of Production Research,"The delivery of goods (freight) accounts for the major cost and emissions in logistics systems worldwide. The effective management of the supply chain requires logistical efficiency and sustainability. Several logistics performance measurements such as distances driven and fuel efficiency are also indicators of sustainability. As an emerging paradigm, the Physical Internet (PI) addresses logistical, societal, and sustainability goals. However, the question remains whether some aspects of logistical efficiency in traditional logistics could be incorporated into the PI paradigm. To this effect, we examine how peddling, a consolidation strategy in traditional logistics, can enhance PI supply chain. Specifically, we formulate optimisation models and study the case of a Mexican automotive supply chain from both the PI and traditional logistics perspectives by comparing three different configurations; namely, Model P built on PI, Model S based on conventional standard peddling, and Model H, a hybrid. The hybrid Model H is optimised in a two-phase solution framework. We show via the case of a Mexican automotive supply chain that Model H outperforms others on average distance travelled and truck utilisation. Thereby, it is concluded that appropriate peddling and shipment consolidation policies may enhance PI supply chain logistics performance.","Chadha S.S., Ülkü M.A., Venkatadri U.",Freight delivery in a Physical Internet Supply Chain: an applied optimisation model with peddling and shipment consolidation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110750013&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2021.1946613&partnerID=40&md5=031d80b734e83f3e76989be8937cd048
Applied Geography,"The demand for ‘local food’ by U.S. consumers has grown markedly over the last several decades, accompanied by confusion over how to define local food. Is ‘local’ food defined by the location of the farm, food processing factory, distribution warehouse, or all three? Is ‘local’ food defined by geographic, political, or biophysical boundaries? Is ‘local’ solely farm-to-table or can it include factories? This study evaluates food commodity flow ‘localness’ using jurisdictional boundaries and physical distance to investigate the potential for food system transformation and the tradeoffs inherent to ‘localizing’ food production. We take a supply chain approach by making data-driven distinctions between farm-based flows of food and industrial, energy and nonfood (IENF) crops, and manufacturing/distribution flows of food and agriculturally-derived industrial inputs. We analyze the diversity, distance (a proxy for environmental impact), political boundaries, population, weight, and price (net selling value) of food commodity flows. The diversity of a community's food supply has an optimal range of zero to four-hundred miles. We find tradeoffs between food system diversity and local food sourcing, sustainability, and self-sufficiency. As communities look to improve food system resilience, they will need to balance food-miles and the other values associated with local food.","Bingham D.R., Rushforth R.R., Stevens B., Ruddell B.L.",Mapping local food self-sufficiency in the U.S. and the tradeoffs for food system diversity,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128377159&doi=10.1016%2fj.apgeog.2022.102687&partnerID=40&md5=e3814780358ba3ec1388633387ed19cf

From the ten projections, four are those with the highest probability of occurrence (EP > 70%), with high impact (I > 3.5) and desirability of occurrence (I > 3.5). Expert evaluations make it possible to identify that Industry 4.0 and the digital skills of workers, their financing, and the efficiency of Government policies have a high probability of occurrence in the adoption of the CE in 2030. This research responds to the special call of papers providing evidence favouring the implementation of I4.0 in the CE from a holistic approach to draw a roadmap towards adopting the CE practices.","Dongfang W., Ponce P., Yu Z., Ponce K., Tanveer M.",The future of industry 4.0 and the circular economy in Chinese supply chain: In the Era of post-COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129879068&doi=10.1007%2fs12063-021-00220-0&partnerID=40&md5=d6d5785e13c7356e7e303627c26dba42
Cleaner Engineering and Technology,"The development and implementation of recycling networks seems to be a promising way to cope with and mitigate the environmental problems of waste. As a mandatory condition, recycling networks must guarantee the achievement of sustainability requirements. Since the first proposal of the TBL (Triple Bottom Line) in the early 1990s, some authors have suggested that this model should be extended to include more dimensions. Recent studies have proposed that for a system to be sustainable, it should not only include the economic, environmental, and social dimensions but must also consider technological and political aspects and their subsequent sustainability indicators for their evaluation. In regard to recycling networks, however, social, technological, and political dimensions are still to be formalized to facilitate their use when designing recycling networks or evaluating their impact. In order to understand how these social, political, and technological dimensions should be integrated into the sustainability evaluation process of a potential recycling network, a systematic literature review has been conducted. A total of 160 journal articles were selected and analyzed. Information was identified on the problem addressed, the recycling domain, the methodologies used, and the social, technological, and political aspects under consideration. A set of social, political, and technological indicators to be considered for the main recycling network problems (design and planning, decision-making and performance evaluation, provider selection, price, and coordination) is then proposed. The main contribution of this work lies in the understanding for future research of how to consider social, political, and technological aspects taking into account the most common problems addressed in a recycling network. At the same time, findings and research gaps have been derived from these results. This study provides a basis for future work oriented toward the holistic evaluation of sustainable recycling networks.","Santander P., Cruz Sanchez F.A., Boudaoud H., Camargo M.","Social, political, and technological dimensions of the sustainability evaluation of a recycling network.

Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology,"The development of digital technology has facilitated the growth of e-commerce and the recent pandemic has changed the purchasing process and strongly impacted supply chains. These must adapt in order to keep their performance level. As a response to this challenge, the concept of the Physical Internet, which is based on the Digital Internet, looks promising. Hence, we can take advantage of advances in information technology to develop the Physical Internet and to accelerate its implementation. In this paper, we propose a review of the Physical Internet literature based on mathematical programming to answer the following questions: (1) what is the coverage of nodes and links in a supply chain by the current literature on the Physical Internet? (2) What mathematical programming models and formulations are used for modeling and optimizing the problems of supply chains in the context of the Physical Internet? (3) How are sustainability aspects addressed by the proposed models? Following the qualitative content analysis method, we worked in detail on 60 publications up to 2022. We studied them through three categories and presented the quantitative and qualitative results. These findings led us to propose our perception of the supply chain in the context of the physical Internet and in particular the issues of considering a supply network instead of a supply chain.

The Digital Supply Chain,"The digital transformation of supply chains is happening at the same time as environmental and social impacts are leading to a radical rethink of the very nature of supply chains, how they are designed, and how they are managed. We examine the intersection of digital transformation and sustainability in the supply chain and consider whether they are complementary or in tension. We analyze sustainability in the digital supply chain by combining the supply chain SCOR model with the triple bottom line sustainability perspective that incorporates economic, environmental, and social dimensions. The complexities and trade-offs among these factors can lead to unintended consequences for sustainability initiatives. We consider two illustrative case studies: the emerging supply chains for electric passenger vehicles and the beef supply chain. Automotive and agricultural supply chains have to deal with substantial and complex sustainability issues. We identify how digital technologies may support sustainability initiatives or create unintended negative consequences. We draw insights from the two cases to discuss important issues and questions for both research and practice. Given the importance of sustainability, we highlight the need to consider carefully all the consequences of applying digital technologies in order to achieve intended benefits and reduce unintended harm.","Beltagui A., Nunes B., Gold S.",Sustainability and the digital supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137853540&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-323-91614-1.00023-X&partnerID=40&md5=7fcf3ca54646e8ac455db7eb673bdd9d

Blockchain Technology for Emerging Applications: A Comprehensive Approach,"The early days of cyberspace expansion saw many people hesitant to use the internet for two dominant reasons: obscurity and skepticism. Yet, the internet soon became a one-stop solution to a diverse range of sectors, where a need to resolve issues such as data confidentiality and integrity gained prime importance. In 2008, an online currency called Bitcoin was launched by an anonymous developer or developer community called Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was deemed to be a viable alternative to fiat or government-issued currency. What made Bitcoin famous and easily adaptable was the ease of accessibility in the form of a device application or simply “wallet” that included the nodes or “blocks” on which transaction data would be stored and processed instantaneously and the intention behind it to create a trustworthy cash system that would give individuals complete ownership of their transactions, not at risk of security breaches. With the advent and success of Bitcoin, new doors opened for other cryptocurrencies and digital assets like Ethereum and Litecoin, and it was observed that unlike fiduciary money, the sustainability of a thorough and transparent record must be maintained in connection with the exchange of digitalized money between any two parties whose anonymity would be preserved. Eventually, this became a turning point and marked the beginning of blockchain technology, which functioned as a distributed ledger system ensuring secure transactions given its strong and complex cryptographic background strengthened with the help of hashing techniques and timestamps. Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database as a part of the implementation, and the technology synchronized all transactions across multiple geographies in a peer-to-peer network (P2P) without the involvement of mediating authorities like a bank or payments processing company. Having received extensive attention, blockchains revolve around a fundamental concept that transactions are clustered into blocks and exchanged and checked by a network of nodes in the distributed environment with mutual agreement or consensus. To achieve this, consensus algorithms are implemented to instill certainty regarding user security and ledger consistency in a distributed network. Over time, this technology penetrated spheres other than virtual currency management. It showed the unimaginable potential to eliminate enormous amounts of record organization and storage problems, streamlining supply chains, making blockchain unarguably the most important innovation since the emergence of artificial intelligence.","Venkat Narayana Rao T., Likhar P.P., Kurni M., Saritha K.",Blockchain: A new perspective in cyber technology,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137600371&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-323-90193-2.00004-1&partnerID=40&md5=39984b5e2c19e47b265315629fa8c55f
Advanced Organic Waste Management: Sustainable Practices and Approaches,"The effect of COVID-19 is changing the ways in which we live, starting with one day then onto the next. While national and local regulatory interventions are widely centered on securing human wellbeing and economies, effective and sustainable waste management approaches are of paramount importance to limit the possible secondary environmental impacts in the longer run. In addition, considering the trend of the last 20 years, the COVID-19 episode is the third reported pandemic this century, following SARS and MERS in 2003 and 2012, individually. Therefore, similar pandemics with potentially greater magnitude and graver impacts are more likely to occur in the future based on the earlier analyses of disease outbreaks. It is within this context and more broadly to address overwhelmed waste management system exposed during the pandemic, the chapter aims to present: (i) the status of global solid waste generation and changes in its dynamics brought upon by COVID-19 crisis due to the fluctuated resource consumption, (ii) pandemic induced consumer’s behavioral changes resulting in panic purchasing of groceries, food stockpiling, over-buying, inappropriate storage, and overcooking which ultimately ended up as households waste, (iii) challenges and limitations faced by waste management authorities in handling the abrupt increase in volume and type of the solid waste generated globally, and, (iv) opportunities and strategies that gravely enables in obtaining resilient and sustainable waste management practices to overcome similar challenges in future pandemics.","Parashar N., Hait S., Hussain C.M.","Implications of COVID-19 pandemic on waste management practices: Challenges, opportunities, and strategies towards sustainability",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130157866&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-323-85792-5.00007-1&partnerID=40&md5=1cdd9265af41bd88f56a67eb48e510b7
Materials Today: Proceedings,"The effect of globalization has been the spread of manufacturing across the globe driving the competition to increase the profitability of business organizations. The economic prosperity resulting from globalization increased the consumer demand and this, in turn, created a demand for goods and services. The majority of the organizations had aimed for increasing profits which resulted in severe damage to the environment due to the process and the end of the useful life of the products. The increased awareness has created back pressure on the suppliers of goods and services to have improved sustainability practices which lead to the implementation of many good environmental practices. Green Supply Chain Management is one among several concepts of sustainability, which encompasses all the activities of the products and services from the raw materials to the end of life and disposal. Many elements of the GSCM are implemented across the geographies in various sectors to varying degrees and the higher the level of implementation, the higher is the economic and environmental performance. The diversity of priorities of people across nations makes it difficult to implement the GSCM practices at the same level and thus there is a need to focus on the local levels for better implementation by eliminating the issues faced at the micro-level.","Kumar Shetty S., Subrahmanya Bhat K.",Green supply chain management practices implementation and sustainability -A review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127444764&doi=10.1016%2fj.matpr.2021.10.135&partnerID=40&md5=0059b0d50fea68ecfd000394c5162a09
Climate Change Management,"The effects of climate change on agriculture and productive resources would be geographically different. As a result, food trade would provide a vital bridge between countries with surplus and those with deficits. The virtual resource flow concept, such as virtual water or land use, quantifies the indirect transfer of productive resources via food commodity trade. Virtual water or land use refers to the volume of water or area of land used, respectively, to produce a given quantity of food commodity which is traded. The hypothesis of the virtual resource flow concept seems potentially capable of providing a theoretical context for a trade strategy or policy that can serve coupled resource-food security goals to support adaptation and resilience to climate change. However, opponents have argued that some conceptual limitations diminish the utility of the virtual resource flow concept for trade policy or strategy. The main limitation relates to difficulties in quantifying and isolating the usefulness and effects of virtual resource flows on the resource security of the destination country. The conceptual limitation for policy or trade strategy can be redressed by evaluating virtual resource flows in an agri-compatibility framework. The objective of this chapter is to promote the agri-compatibility framework to advance the utility of the virtual resource flow concept for strategic trade decisions or adaptive policy in response to climate change. The chapter reviews the virtual resource concept and its limitation for policy and then sets out the usefulness and the conditions for evaluating virtual resource flows in the agri-compatibility framework as a basis for coupled resource-food security policy or strategy under climate change. It is concluded that the virtual resource flow concept is useful for policy if it meets the conditions of agri-compatibility. Future work on estimates of agri-compatible virtual resource flows in different contexts is recommended to facilitate wider practical applications.",Yawson D.O.,The Utility of Agri-Compatible Virtual Resource Flows for Food Security Policy and Strategy Under Climate Change,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128887320&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-87934-1_9&partnerID=40&md5=4f24df6b3ec4582d5f001c6d8165534e

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The efficiency of sustainability assessments of textile products is generally prevented because of a lack of available and reliable data across complex and globalized supply chains. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how blockchain traceability data can improve the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of textile products and to measure the actual value of exploiting this specific traceability data. To do so, a case study consisting of two LCAs modeling the production of wool top lots in China was conducted. A first LCA was conducted with generic data and the second with the added value of specific blockchain traceability data. Based on the second LCA, different wool top lot composition scenarios were then modeled to account for the environmental impact of different farming practices. Two main results were obtained: the environmental impact of wool top lots can vary up to +118% between two batches depending on their composition, and the specific data changes drastically from the impact calculated with generic data, with +36% calculated impact for the same wool composition of batches. Therefore, it was concluded that blockchain traceability data could be a strong asset for conducting LCA at the batch level by providing differentiated data on batch composition and origin and providing readily available specific data for a more representative assessment.","Carrières V., Lemieux A.-A., Margni M., Pellerin R., Cariou S.",Measuring the Value of Blockchain Traceability in Supporting LCA for Textile Products,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124726686&doi=10.3390%2fsu14042109&partnerID=40&md5=fb8bf9b76572d0f32ddf92c3a88a4e1e
Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,"The Electricity Supply Chain is a system of enabling procedures to optimize processes ranging from production to transportation and consumption of electricity.

Complexity,"The electronics manufacturing industry is in an era of collaborative thinking and rapid change, as the rise of strategic alliances (SAs) plays a critical role in supply chain management. Strategic alliance (SA) collaboration is one of the most common strategies in the electronics industry, helping companies to complement each other. Most organizations or alliances operate together to produce more beneficial technologies for mutual benefit based on the sustainability thinking, such as in the areas of 5G, electric vehicles, aerospace, and smart healthcare. As the prompt evolution of information technology and electronics has a deep impact on global business activities, selecting partners based on a sustainability perspective is an urgent task. This paper proposes a complete sustainable SA partner selection framework to select the optimal partners. A neutrosophic-based decision-making model is used in the analysis. The neutrosophic ITARA technique is proposed to generate a set of criteria objective weights, and the neutrosophic TOPSIS technique is applied to determine the performance and priority of sustainable SA partners. This study introduces neutrosophic fuzzy logic to reflect the uncertainty in complex problems. Real-world data from a multinational passive component manufacturing company are used for case demonstration and analysis. The framework and methodology proposed in this study have many contributions to the electronics industry, including the establishment of assessment criteria, the identification of criteria, and the provision of partner selection practices.

Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 have threatened the world’s public health security. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many countries and significantly smashed the global economy, and also affected the health of the environment. This has upraised many apprehensions about its high transmission rate. Even though the most important routes of its transmission include direct contact and respiratory droplets, the infection through non-direct contacts also plays an important role. The increasing demand for intensive healthcare, escalating death toll and disruption in supply chains and trade have directed to mass implementation of testing, quarantine, and lockdown to restrain virus transmission. The lockdown has been a boon and a bane as well when it comes to the health of the environment. It had improved the air and water quality since the industrial activities were banned and therefore there was no addition of pollutants in the environment, but the usage of plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical waste has simultaneously resulted in huge plastic pollution that is choking seas and marine lives. The precautionary measures given by the United Nations Environment Programme in its COVID response factsheets suggest ways to reduce medical waste and to prevent the spread of the present pandemic. The recent green innovations and environmental stringency programs have resulted in reducing the threats to the environment that would eventually help in inhibiting the spread of such pandemics. In addition, proper measures should be adopted to safeguard the complete health of humans and the environment to execute safety and sustainable development that will help in achieving a stable biome.

International Journal of Production Economics,"The emergence of Physical Internet (PI) has profoundly changed the logistics supply chain paradigm. Logistics service providers (LSPs) could benefit from the improved logistics efficiency and environment sustainability if they finish the door-to-door services by themselves. However, in practice, door-to-door services are usually provided by both short-distance LSPs and long-distance LSPs, rather than a single LSP. And the short-distance LSP usually has private demand information, which has to be shared if the PI-enabled operational model is adopted. Therefore, how to coordinate LSPs' incentives regarding profit allocation and demand information sharing becomes the bottleneck of PI adoption. We thus build a logistics service supply chain model where differentiated logistics services are jointly provided by a short-distance LSP and a long-distance LSP. We find that, the long-distance LSP always benefits from PI because it can determine a more accurate service price with the short-distance LSP's shared demand information. However, the short-distance LSP's preference of PI depends on the degree of logistics efficiency improvement and the service competition intensity. When the logistics efficiency improvement is in a moderate range, the short-distance LSP prefers PI when the service competition intensity is either low or high. We further identify a “dilemma” where the environment sustainability is deteriorated under PI-enabled operational model.","Niu B., Dai Z., Liu Y., Jin Y.",The role of Physical Internet in building trackable and sustainable logistics service supply chains: A game analysis,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124579722&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108438&partnerID=40&md5=410f618b3b897f674c909869797169d3
Cogent Engineering,"The emerging concerns towards sustainability have encouraged industrial stakeholders to get involved and cooperate to achieve a sustainable supply chain. This paper develops a coordination mechanism for a closed-loop supply chain, operating under several policies to control the carbon emission, namely a carbon tax regulation, government incentives policy, green technology investment, and energy-saving investment. The carbon tax regulation is implemented to lessen the emissions from the manufacturer’s activities. Whereas, to encourage the manufacturer to cut down the emission as well as to increase the product return and energy savings, the government provides incentives based on a target level. The system operates under a variable market demand which is affected by the retailer’s selling price, green technology, and energy-saving levels. The proposed problem is formulated under two different scenarios, which are the centralized model and the decentralized model. To improve the supply chain coordination, we also propose two different contracts, namely the green technology revenue-investment-sharing contract (GRIS contract) and the energy saving revenue-investment-sharing contract (ERIS contract). The system inflicted with two types of inspection error in classifying the returned products. The models are formulated mathematically and optimized using a proposed algorithm. The result shows that the centralized model performs better in maximizing the total profit compared to the decentralized model. The results also imply that the government incentives toward product returns, green technology, and energy-saving actually affect the optimal decision of the supply chain system. In addition, the proposed contracts are proven to provide win–win solutions and improve supply chain coordination.","Adam N.A.F.P., Jauhari W.A., Dwicahyani A.R.","Manufacturer-retailer coordination in a closed-loop supply chain system with emission reduction, government incentives, and energy-saving level",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135907455&doi=10.1080%2f23311916.2022.2107789&partnerID=40&md5=53659c1e40bbf8b1e607c122a0f44f87
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The endeavour to align the goals of the Swedish food strategy with the national environmental quality objectives and the 17 global SDGs, presents an extraordinary challenge that calls for systemic innovation. Industrial symbiosis can potentially provide the means for increasing sustainable food production, using locally sub-exploited resources that can reduce the need for land, agro-chemicals, transport and energy. This case study of the municipality of Härnösand, aims to assess opportunities and challenges for using waste flows and by-products for local food production, fa-cilitated by industrial symbiosis. A potential symbiotic network was developed during three work-shops with the main stakeholders in Härnösand. The potential of the COVID-19 pandemic to insti-gate policy changes, behavioural changes and formation of new alliances that may catalyse the transition towards food systems based on industrial symbiosis is discussed. The material flow inventory revealed that many underexploited resource flows were present in quantities that rendered them commercially interesting. Resources that can be used for innovative food production include, e.g., lignocellulosic residues, rock dust, and food processing waste. The internalised drive among local companies interested in industrial symbiosis and the emerging symbiotic relations, provide a fertile ground for the establishment of a local network that can process the sub-exploited material flows. Although there are multiple challenges for an industrial symbiosis network to form in Härnösand, this study shows that there is a significant potential to create added value from the region’s many resources while at the same time making the food system more sustainable and resilient, by expand-ing industrial symbiosis practices.","Haller H., Fagerholm A.-S., Carlsson P., Skoglund W., van den Brink P., Danielski I., Brink K., Mirata M., Englund O.",Towards a Resilient and Resource-Efficient Local Food System Based on Industrial Symbiosis in Härnösand: A Swedish Case Study,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124825875&doi=10.3390%2fsu14042197&partnerID=40&md5=25f4aa2d06b636b6ae4f65899f3935f0

The perimeter of the LCA is the full offshore substation (all electrical equipment, auxiliary equipment, platform systems and structures) all over the asset life, except the HV export cables and the IAC cables. The process is iterative and, over the time, allows to build a quantitative model where the characteristics of each component are identi ed, the environmental impacts are calculated, all over the asset life. Several alternatives in design have been tested in the model, covering driving choices for the equipment and the infrastructure. The results have enabled RTE to understand the factors that allow to reduce the environmental impact and make the offshore substation as sustainable as possible. Finally, the future step of implementation are described. The main ambition is to drive the company choices in design, supply chain, construction, operations and maintenance aspects. The vision is to reduce the environmental footprint of all the infrastructure all over its life cycle, create a positive integration within the environment, foster technical and social innovations, and support new solutions for the sustainable development of a future decarbonized system infrastructure.","Botrugno D., Nunes-Rte M.",Eco-design as a systemic innovation method for offshore substations,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127950504&partnerID=40&md5=3cacb0b1873a2e1b3e3c91ccbaf8dd05
Journal of Cleaner Production,"The environmental and economic aspects of sustainability have been the most common subjects in the manufacturing industry, while the social one tends to be neglected. The process of semistructured interviews is conducted with design practitioners in the computer, communication, and consumer electronics industry in Taiwan to comprehend how the participating companies can move from a business-as-usual model to a more sustainable business by design. Results show that ecodesign and design for circular economy are commonly applied as sustainable design strategies, highlighting the concept of dematerialization. The three pragmatic tools applied alongside for balancing the three pillars of sustainability are life cycle thinking, design thinking, and business model tools. To achieve sustainable industrial ecosystems, three key actors, namely, a driver, a facilitator, and a supporter, play an important role to create stakeholder engagement and supply chain collaboration. Hence, the companies must tackle major challenges related to organizational culture, social reputation and communication, resource availability, service at the end of life, and effective waste treatment. Relying solely on product level for sustainability is insufficient; the companies need to tap into socio-technical systems by creating new partnerships, supporting multidisciplinary teams, embracing new markets, integrating emerging technologies for social sustainability, and promoting innovative and social inclusive thinking.","Suppipat S., Hu A.H.",Achieving sustainable industrial ecosystems by design: A study of the ICT and electronics industry in Taiwan,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135913871&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.133393&partnerID=40&md5=44c14b1d7926f3172769e96432f581e8
Science of the Total Environment,"The environmental impact of Parmigiano Reggiano PDO cheese was quantified using the Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCRs) in a Traditional System (TS) and in an Improved Management System (IMS). The TS differs from IMS with respect to slurry management (raw slurry storage vs anaerobic digestion and storage of the liquid fraction of digestate) and application of nutrients to the field (by slurry tanker with a diverter plate vs soil injection at pre-sowing and side dressing). Two additional scenarios were evaluated by considering the possible environmental enhancement achievable by reducing enteric methane production and by using soybean grain produced in Italy as the protein source for animals' diets. The environmental impact was quantified both for 1 kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) and for the production of 10 g dry matter equivalent of cheese as single score. For the first assessment, the environmental impact results were 124 and 112 μPt kg FPCM−1 for TS and IMS, respectively. In the second case, it was 10.8 μPt and 9.9 μPt 10 g dry matter equivalent−1 of cheese, for TS and IMS, respectively. The specific cost for reducing the GHG emissions in this production chain was equal to 34 € Mg−1 milk produced. Finally, although specific studies should consider the reduction of enteric methane emissions and the use of soybean grain nationally produced as feed source, the scenarios evaluated in this study highlighted some potential for environmental improvements. Even small environmental improvements to the Parmigiano Reggiano PDO cheese supply chain can bring substantial improvements to the sustainability of the food market, because of the widespread demand on the global market of Parmigiano Reggiano and of its chance of attracting consumers who are sensitive to environmental problems.","Lovarelli D., Tamburini A., Garimberti S., D'Imporzano G., Adani F.",Life cycle assessment of Parmigiano Reggiano PDO cheese with product environmental footprint method: A case study implementing improved slurry management strategies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132933222&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.156856&partnerID=40&md5=acfe080fbd52ad2d255f2f2226d109a2
Fuel,"The environmental policy of the European Union is boosting the development of renewable energies. Among these, bioenergy holds the main share and is expected to further increase. Such development requires a higher degree of efficiency in the whole supply chain. This is achieved also with an enhanced fuel quality control and a better matching with the energy conversion systems. For solid biofuels, moisture content is the main quality parameters, influencing the sustainability of the whole energy system. With the aim to provide a real-time and portable tool for moisture measurement, a hand-held near infrared spectrometer was tested on a dataset of 817 wood chip samples provided by an industrial facility. A set of key performance parameters were used to compare the estimation of three alternative prediction models and the standard oven dry method. Results show a satisfactory reliability with R2 ranging from 0.86 to 0.89 depending on the model. A single measure can be acquired in few seconds, and the potential to deploy the non-destructive analysis directly at the fuel storage (yard) and at different steps of the supply chain discloses a wide range of options to efficiently control fuel quality.","Toscano G., Leoni E., Gasperini T., Picchi G.",Performance of a portable NIR spectrometer for the determination of moisture content of industrial wood chips fuel,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126945532&doi=10.1016%2fj.fuel.2022.123948&partnerID=40&md5=fbfdbcd239b5ecd6dd36307532930035
Business Strategy and the Environment,"The environmental sustainability of logistics facilities is widely acknowledged as an important issue, but a comprehensive standardised methodology for assessing their environmental impact is lacking. This study proposes a structured model for quantifying both consumptions and generated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, adopting a three-phase methodology that combines multiple methods. A literature-based conceptual framework was leveraged to design an analytical model, and in-depth interviews with 11 senior logistics managers were conducted. The study offers a replicable methodology that considers heterogeneous sources of consumption and related end-use types, further splitting consumptions and emissions by warehouses' functional areas. It offers a set of Environmental Performance Indicators (EPIs) that could bolster a clearer understanding of the warehouse environmental performance.

Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering,"The environmental, economic, social, and technical challenges associated with implementing the air pollution control technologies (APCTs) in oil, gas, and petrochemical industries (OGPIs) necessitate a sustainability prioritization analysis. Environmental issues, economic parameters, social concerns, and technical performances all must assessed and weighted. Accomplishing such a crucial decision with rigorous potential environmental, economic, social, and technical effects needs a robust decision support system (DSS) for guiding the sustainability prioritization process of the technologies. This study purposes in developing a hybrid DSS by integrating the analytical network process (ANP), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and multi-objective optimization on the basis of ration analysis (MULTIMOORA) methods based on the fuzzy set theory for sustainability prioritization of implementing APCTs. Three cases of the petrochemical plant, gas refinery, and oil refinery in Iran are selected to assess and prioritize the most commonly used of APCTs including four alternatives of Electrostatic precipitators, Fabric filters, and Wet scrubbers, and Cyclones by the proposed DSS. The sustainability ranking of implementing the four technologies sequentially for three cases is obtained. The suggested DSS is feasible for group decision-making based on experts’ opinions and uncertain data. It can assist the stakeholders/decision-makers to attain the energy and carbon management (ECM) policies in three cases and apply to advance the oil & gas supply chains towards the targets of sustainability, green growth, and low-carbon economy.

Erde,"The ethics of ecological production, egalitarianism, and democratic control underpinning recent research directions in agri-environmental governance are common to many of the issues explored in the alternative economies literature. One way in which these ethics are put into practice in agri-environmental governance is through the concept of ‘nested markets’. Using qualitative methods of interviews and a focus group discussion, we examine newly constructed markets for food at different spatial scales in West Bengal, India. We find that multifunctional farmers and other actors along the supply chain started to construct and/or strengthen their own outlets and channels to reach consumers and to sell their products. Some of these markets build on long, historically deeply-rooted experiences, such as local periodic markets; others are relatively new constructions, making use of internet marketing platforms or messaging services and direct home delivery. Although they are market segments that are nested in the wider commodity markets for food, they have a different nature, different dynamics, a different redistribution of value added, and different relations between producers and consumers. Surprisingly, environmental issues were considered to be less important motivations than the creation of solidarity between producers and consumers. A deeper examination of these markets suggests new possible answers to the question of how to improve the sustainability of agricultural systems within an alternative economies framework.","Chatterjee S.A., Bernzen A.","What drives the creation of nested markets?

Case Studies on Transport Policy,"The evidence base evaluating post-privatised commercial ports is virtually non-existent, especially with respect to sustainability and environmental performance. Despite acknowledged methodological limitations, a case study approach is adopted using Port Botany, Australia, as an example of a “privatised” port. In the post-privatisation period from 2013, we examine the respective roles of the public and private sectors in terms of legislation, policies and practice. How has NSW Ports responded to challenges of sustainability and environmental regulation within the port's jurisdiction? to what extent have governments continued to be involved in planning and investment in the logistics chain to support the import and export of containers? and what are the relative costs to the private sector and the government to achieve more efficiency? The methodology involves material retrieved from websites, government and company reports, and discussions with key informants to verify the factual robustness of our findings. The findings show that the pre-privatisation environmental and regulatory framework has been effective, and that NSW Ports have been part of an Australian-wide ports initiative to implement best practice on climate change, and on economic, social and environmental sustainability countering claims in the literature that privatised ports put shareholder's profits before the “greening” of ports.

Agronomy,"The excessive use of agrochemicals to ensure food security under the conditions of a growing population, global climate change, weather extremes, droughts, wasteful use of freshwater resources, and land degradation has created severe challenges for sustainable crop production. Since the frequent and abrupt environmental changes are outcompeting the existing agricultural technologies of crop production systems to meet food security, the development and use of modern technologies and nature-based solutions are urgently needed. Nanotechnology has shown potential for revolutionizing agri-production and agri-business in terms of nanofertilizers and nanoparticles for crop protection. Furthermore, in the recent past, biochar has been identified as a negative emission technology for carbon sequestration and soil fertility improvement. However, supply chain issues for biochar, due to feedstock availability, challenges its worldwide use and acceptability. Meanwhile progress in algae research has indicated that, algae can be utilized for various agro-ecosystem services. Algae are considered an efficient biological species for producing biomass and phytochemicals because of their high photosynthetic efficiency and growth rate compared to terrestrial plants. In this context, various options for using algae as a nature-based solution have been investigated in this review; for instance, the possibilities of producing bulk algal biomass and algal-based biofertilizers and their role in nutrient availability and abiotic stress resistance in plants. The potential of algae for biochar production (hereafter “phycochar” because of algal feedstock), its elemental composition, and role in bioremediation is discussed. The potential role of agal nanoparticles’ in mitigating abiotic stress in crop plants was thoroughly investigated. This review has effectively investigated the existing literature and improved our understanding that, algae-based agro-solutions have huge potential for mitigating abiotic stresses and improving overall agricultural sustainability. However, a few challenges, such as microalgae production on a large scale and the green synthesis of nanoparticle methodologies, still need further mechanistic investigation.","Abideen Z., Waqif H., Munir N., El-Keblawy A., Hasnain M., Radicetti E., Mancinelli R., Nielsen B.L., Haider G.","Algal-Mediated Nanoparticles, Phycochar, and Biofertilizers for Mitigating Abiotic Stresses in Plants: A Review",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137360303&doi=10.3390%2fagronomy12081788&partnerID=40&md5=4370e602c14d5a5dc4a33dfeb5a5a88b
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The existence of external two-fold pressure regarding competitiveness and sustainable development in a capital-intensive industry supports the need for sustainable performance. However, endeavors to create a sustainable framework to measure the performance of the oil and gas (O&G) industry are mostly devoted to the production and supply chain of petrochemical products and rarely focus on a maintenance perspective. Motivated by such scarcity, the goal of this research was to discuss and articulate the performance assessment framework by integrating concepts of maintenance and sustainability in the O&G industry. This study proposed the use of a range of performance measures for assessing sustainability on offshore production and drilling platforms. The conceptual framework consists of four aspects of sustainability categorized into technical, environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Each measure was assigned according to its relevance at the strategic, tactical, and functional levels of maintenance decision making. The conceptual framework resulted in hierarchical clusters of twelve strategic indicators. These indicators consist of conventional measures as well as new ones relating to the safety and reliability on offshore platforms. The potential contribution of the present study is found in its intention to empower a better understanding of sustainable maintenance and encourage those making decisions about practical implementation within the O&G industry.

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","The expanding customer consciousness of ecological sustainability has motivated supply chain members to participate in green activities. In this paper, the coordination issue of a dual-channel supply chain is studied under consideration of the greening level of the items. The two-stage supply chain consists of a manufacturer and a retailer. The manufacturer is responsible for keeping the item’s greening level and sells the products through two channels (a) a direct online channel and (b) a traditional retail channel. Market demand depends on the selling price and greening level of the item. Furthermore, the pricing and greening strategies of the channel members are discussed under the centralized and decentralized scenarios. Compared to the centralized scenario, optimum pricing at the retail channel is higher in the decentralized scenario while the greening level of products is low. The outcomes exhibit that the profit of the supply chain in a decentralized scenario decreases compared to the centralized scenario. To enhance the supply chain profit, we have developed two coordinate mechanisms of the decentralized scenario with a cost-sharing contract and a profit-sharing contract. Our analysis shows that the profit-sharing contract can realize the coordination, but the cost-sharing contract cannot. A numerical example has been demonstrated to quantify the effectiveness of different contracts, and the model’s finding is demonstrated.","Das R., Barman A., Roy B., De P.K.",Pricing and greening strategies in a dual-channel supply chain with cost and profit sharing contracts,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126878114&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-022-02255-0&partnerID=40&md5=b8bcbb9286a7b3ca494b1134a426b672

Insects,"The expected global population growth to 9.7 billion people in 2050 and the significant change in global dietary patterns require an increase in global food production by about 60%. The protein supply for feed and food is most critical and requires an extension in protein sources. Edible insects can upgrade low-grade side streams of food production into high-quality protein, amino acids and vitamins in a very efficient way. Insects are considered to be the “missing link” in the food chain of a circular and sustainable economy. Insects and insect-derived products have entered the European market since first being acknowledged as a valuable protein source for feed and food production in around 2010. However, today, scaling up the insect value chain in Europe is progressing at a relatively slow pace. The mission of SUSINCHAIN (SUStainable INsect CHAIN)—a four-year project which has received funding from the European Commission—is to contribute to novel protein provision for feed and food in Europe by overcoming the remaining barriers for increasing the economic viability of the insect value chain and opening markets by combining forces in a comprehensive multi-actor consortium. The overall project objective is to test, pilot and demonstrate recently developed technologies, products and processes, to realize a shift up to Technology Readiness Level 6 or higher. In addition to these crucial activities, the project engages with stakeholders in the insect protein supply chain for feed and food by living labs and workshops. These actions provide the necessary knowledge and data for actors in the insect value chain to decrease the cost price of insect products, process insects more efficiently and market insect protein applications in animal feed and regular human diets that are safe and sustainable. This paves the way for further upscaling and commercialization of the European insect sector.","Veldkamp T., Meijer N., Alleweldt F., Deruytter D., Van Campenhout L., Gasco L., Roos N., Smetana S., Fernandes A., van der Fels-Klerx H.J.",Overcoming Technical and Market Barriers to Enable Sustainable Large-Scale Production and Consumption of Insect Proteins in Europe: A SUSINCHAIN Perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126928782&doi=10.3390%2finsects13030281&partnerID=40&md5=a94ad8a89e9e538887486b84c40e9d2d

Moreover, demand for new products is currently extremely high, thus determining more sources to be managed, waste, a greater impact of production systems. Several studies have been proposed in literature addressing sustainability issues, but companies' perspective is rarely included and empirical research was highly recommended from researchers. In response, the will to collect evidences of some selected aspects related to drivers encouraging sustainable actions, practices, and performances reached. To this end, a survey was developed and sent to some Northern Italian companies operating in the fashion field. Descriptive, factor, cluster and discriminant analyses were performed on the sample using Statistical Package for Social Science software package. The companies surveyed show awareness and information about the issues related to sustainability and they are also willing to support actions for greening their supply chain. However, they are also hesitant towards the concrete adoption of green practices (both at present and in the future). Among the main findings, unexpectedly, the topic of Reverse Logistics turned out to be of scarce interest, while the quality of garments is perceived not to be affected by the usage of recycled or alternative raw materials.

"Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies, CISTI","The fashion industry is considered unsustainable as products are made and disposed quickly causing damage to the environment due to huge amounts of water consumption, pollution, and large carbon emissions. To fight this growing problem, more and more companies in the fashion industry are required to show proof of sustainability which can be a very difficult task as this industry needs global supply chains for their activities, and these are very fragmented and have serious transparency and traceability issues. Thus, there is very poor data quality control, disruptions are hard to communicate and searching for data is very difficult as it often gets lost.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The fast fashion industry is subject to growing calls for transparency, from civil society groups as well as consumers. Despite universal pressure on retailers to disclose information on supply chain practices, uptake of transparency policies and practices has been heterogenous amongst large fast fashion companies. In this paper, we explain variation in transparency practices through a comparison of the four largest fast fashion retailers: H&M, Inditex, Gap, and Fast Retailing. Drawing on cross-case comparison and within-case process tracing, we offer insights into why some retailers are more transparent than others. Our findings suggest that sustainability scandals are a necessary but insufficient condition for motivating firms to increase transparency in their supply chains.

Driven by currently enhanced, ability to store different layers of information per merchantable unit (tree assortments at final or semi-final form or containers of woody biomass), RFID applications can provide valuable solutions and revolutionize wood supply chains by warranting traceability, combating illegal logging, minimizing waste and offering detailed information of the wood products properties, among other benefits that are presented in the text. The benefits can be identified at the ecological, social and economic levels, addressing the sustainability concerns of modern societies. To make use of this huge potential, a continuous flow and fusion of information at all supply chain stages must be taken for granted, as well as the close cooperation among stakeholders.","Tsioras P.A., Żak J., Karaszewski Z.",RFID IMPLEMENTATIONS IN THE WOOD SUPPLY CHAINS: STATE OF THE ART AND THE WAY TO THE FUTURE,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138186119&doi=10.12841%2fwood.1644-3985.420.07&partnerID=40&md5=cdb0945c93a40b41848ae4897c2f415d

International Journal of Production Research,"The food grain production in India has progressively risen in the past few decades, whereas the storage capacity has remained limited. The policymakers in India are attempting to close this capacity gap while addressing sustainability objectives. However, the quantification and integration of multiple social sustainability factors have remained a challenge. To improve the overall sustainability, the study attempts to develop a mathematical model considering procurement, transportation, inventory, and location-related issues. Several supply chain network factors are integrated and assessed while focussing on the social sustainability dimension. Three cases of India's largest food grain-producing and consuming states are analysed with the help of two Pareto-based algorithms. Multiple relationships between variations in supply, demand, and the capacity of silos with three defined objectives are evaluated. It is observed that, the demand significantly influences the economic and environmental objectives compared with the supply and silo capacity. The capacity of silos has a more significant impact on social objectives than economic and environmental objectives. Results reveal the importance of establishing a sufficient number of modernised silos, which reduces environmental impact and improves social factors such as farmers’ economic condition and welfare, balanced economic development, number of jobs created, and public health level.","Mogale D.G., Ghadge A., Cheikhrouhou N., Tiwari M.K.",Designing a food supply chain for enhanced social sustainability in developing countries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131212628&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2022.2078746&partnerID=40&md5=d14242ed71eef1320e08361203536e1e
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"The food industry being pressured to reduce its environmental footprint, and replacing single-use packages with reusable containers would provide one such avenue for improving sustainability. The uncertainty of where and when containers are available for backhaul, insufficient washing service levels, and other barriers like intensive transportation have limited the widespread adoption of reusable containers. This paper models the tactical operations of a circular containers network with diverse actors, exploring the interdependence between uncertainty, service level, and transportation. A linear programming model is constructed where the packaging pooler's costs are minimized while meeting the demands and service needs of the food suppliers and the retailers. This model is applied to a real-world case study of a reusable container network in Italy involving the fresh food supply chain. The model is then augmented with simulations to estimate uncertain parameters and is resolved via robust optimization. We find that improving the pooler's current solution is possible, even with uncertainties of where and when containers are collected for backhaul. We quantify how improving washing service levels will change the network solution and raise costs. We likewise explore how reducing the distance suppliers must travel to collect containers impacts the pooler's operations and costs, as well as the overall distances and subsequent emissions associated with the transport of containers. While there is great potential to improve the current solution, future work is needed both to build better decision support tools and to understand of how to determine where on the Pareto frontier the solution will lie and perhaps influence it for the greater good.","Accorsi R., Cholette S., Manzini R., Mucci L.","Managing uncertain inventories, washing, and transportation of reusable containers in food retailer supply chains",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125836041&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.02.014&partnerID=40&md5=a4c39be33b35760e03f2df649960ea29
Business Strategy and the Environment,"The food industry is increasingly using decision support tools to address the food loss and waste challenge. Extant food loss and waste tools predominantly focus on environmental metrics and do not sufficiently integrate important social and financial considerations. They have therefore been deemed to lack business readiness. This critical review aims to assess how tools can be integrated within organisations supporting the progress towards sustainability and what tensions are inherent in preventing and reducing food loss and waste (FLW). This review extends paradox theory by adding the dimensions of FLW and tools to previous research on paradoxes and sustainable development. The significance of the review is creating an opportunity for scholars and practitioners to rethink current business practices as necessary for addressing sustainability challenges. The review contributes to previous research in FLW-reducing tools within the context of business responses to sustainability issues. The findings show the role of leadership in promoting participation and collaboration for positive environmental outcomes. These findings offer three practical recommendations for businesses: (1) simple yet comprehensive tools tailored to business needs can enhance decisions, (2) a paradoxical approach for considering food supply chain demands and (3) leaders should encourage individuals and teams to learn and collaborate for business success.",Somlai R.,Integrating decision support tools into businesses for sustainable development: A paradoxical approach to address the food waste challenge,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122766609&doi=10.1002%2fbse.2972&partnerID=40&md5=f24abee48722d1ed833427771ee8f0ac
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The food industry is one of the main drivers of climate change, with serious impacts on the living and working conditions in developing countries. Due to these sustainability issues, consumers, governments, and non-governmental organizations are pressuring food companies to rethink their current business concepts of food production. Food companies rely on supply chain governance and its mechanisms to implement sustainability standards across all tiers of their supply chains. This study examines the sustainability governance at all stages of a cocoa supply chain, from the raw material production to the retailer, by using a qualitative case study approach. The results show a differentiation of the sustainability governance according to the different supply chain stages. At the raw material production stage, sustainability is mainly improved using contracts, extensive and frequent knowledge sharing, and audits. After the raw material production stage, environmental and social sustainability is almost exclusively coordinated by certificates, while other governance mechanisms are used to foster long-term economic business relationships. This study gives detailed insights into the application intentions and the functioning of sustainability governance mechanisms and provides propositions on how to efficiently improve sustainability in food supply chains.","Keller J., Jung M., Lasch R.",Sustainability Governance: Insights from a Cocoa Supply Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139558505&doi=10.3390%2fsu141710763&partnerID=40&md5=4f741946669784ae94b513b2326c5a62
Foods,"The food industry is quite interested in the use of (techno)-functional bioactive compounds from byproducts to develop ‘clean label’ foods in a circular economy. The aim of this review is to evaluate the state of the knowledge and scientific evidence on the use of green extraction technologies (ultrasound-, microwave-, and enzymatic-assisted) of bioactive compounds from pomegranate peel byproducts, and their potential application via the supplementation/fortification of vegetal matrixes to improve their quality, functional properties, and safety. Most studies are mainly focused on ultrasound extraction, which has been widely developed compared to microwave or enzymatic extractions, which should be studied in depth, including their combinations. After extraction, pomegranate peel byproducts (in the form of powders, liquid extracts, and/or encapsulated, among others) have been incorporated into several food matrixes, as a good tool to preserve ‘clean label’ foods without altering their composition and improving their functional properties. Future studies must clearly evaluate the energy efficiency/consumption, the cost, and the environmental impact leading to the sustainable extraction of the key bio-compounds. Moreover, predictive models are needed to optimize the phytochemical extraction and to help in decision-making along the supply chain.","Cano-Lamadrid M., Martínez-Zamora L., Castillejo N., Artés-Hernández F.",From Pomegranate Byproducts Waste to Worth: A Review of Extraction Techniques and Potential Applications for Their Revalorization,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137995473&doi=10.3390%2ffoods11172596&partnerID=40&md5=19f94dcd18c81833ad13a6e019b08c7f
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The food sector is responsible for a considerable impact on the environment in most environmental contexts: the food supply chain causes greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, reduction in cultivable land, and other environmental impacts. Thus, a change in food supply is required to reduce the environmental impacts caused by the food supply chain and to meet the increasing demand for sufficient and qualitative nutrition. Large herds of livestock are inappropriate to achieve these goals due to the relevant impact of meat supply chain on the environment, e.g., the land used to grow feed for animals is eight times more than that for human nutrition. The search for meat alternatives, especially for the intake of critical nutrients such as protein, is a consequent step. In the above context, this paper summarizes the health aspects of protein-rich food alternatives to meat and carries out a literature review on the life-cycle environmental impacts of this alternative food.","Cellura M., Cusenza M.A., Longo S., Luu L.Q., Skurk T.",Life Cycle Environmental Impacts and Health Effects of Protein-Rich Food as Meat Alternatives: A Review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122940902&doi=10.3390%2fsu14020979&partnerID=40&md5=b3f5696cdf6064947f819b3db16849a6
Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,"The food supply chain is one of the most sensitive supply chains as it is directly related to the health of humans and society. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the components of the sustainable supply chain in the food industry. For this purpose, in the first step, several studies and research backgrounds have been conducted by researchers to identify the effective index on sustainability in the food and agricultural supply chain. After reviewing the literature, general indicators of sustainability that affect the agricultural supply chain are specified. Next, by using the fuzzy DEMATEL method, the effectiveness and efficiency of these criteria in three economic, environmental, and social dimensions have been assessed. The results show that in the economic dimension, the use of high technology in the production and the presentation of various citrus forms by using intermediate and conversion industries is the most effective. Criteria for purchasing and using livestock manure instead of using chemical fertilizers have a very high level of effectiveness. In the environmental dimension, reducing or eliminating waste production using recyclable and environmentally friendly materials has the most significant impact. In the social dimension, the positive mental image of customers has a more positive approach to manufacturers who use a sustainable supply chain and has the most impact. The main achievement of this study is that the most important factor in sustainability is the citrus quality control of the agricultural supply chain.","Fesharaki M.H., Safarzadeh H.",Modeling the Sustainable Supply Chain Network Design for Food-Agricultural Industries considering Social and Environmental Impacts,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138311007&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f6726662&partnerID=40&md5=c500706e521d6d6e481fe9c7f8e73929
International Journal of Food Studies,"The food system has become globalized and industrial. As a consequence, food travels long distances to reach consumers and its production is over-reliant on chemicals, leading to high levels of carbon emissions and soil degradation. Short food supply chains (SFSCs) have been advocated as more sustainable alternatives and have been explicitly mentioned by the Dutch government and the EU as a strategy towards achieving sustainability goals. While SFSCs are viable on a small scale, scaling and mainstreaming them has proven difficult due to low margins, high costs, and steep learning curves. Their economic underperformance is particularly glaring when compared to the highly cost-efficient - albeit energy and resource intensive – conventional commercial supply chains. In practice, SFSCs therefore remain isolated success stories, failing to contribute to systemic change in food systems. In efforts to enhance the performance of SFSCs, this paper introduces the GAIN transition model, a novel framework based on gamification which provides a holistic and actionable framework for SFSC actors to coalesce and strategize around a common vision. We illustrate the underlying principles of GAIN and its potential for institutionalizing SFSCs. We find that thus far, GAIN has helped to catalyze action and has proven a useful tool which provides a common language for actors to navigate this complex space. Future research and more dissemination are needed to conclude with more certainty on the quantitative impact of GAIN in terms of enabling and strengthening SFSCs.","Moore D., Massar B., Frederiks M., Veltkamp R., Runhaar H.",Gamification for Sustainable Food Transitions: Supporting Multi-Level Cooperation in Short Food Supply Chains Through GAIN,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135384252&doi=10.7455%2fijfs%2f11.SI.2022.a10&partnerID=40&md5=bb64d9be3412ed836a1c33b0ad00b457

The aim of this study is to understand if there is a market for a high-quality “Parma ham PDO”, produced in sustainable supply chain at an environmental, health and animal welfare level. In this paper, we use discrete choice experiments to investigate Italian consumer's preferences and their willingness to pay (WTP) for Parma ham PDO with different characteristics, amongst which the use of air scrubber technology reducing pollutants emissions. Results seem to encourage the pork industry in better exploring pollutant emissions' reduction, showing a consumers' willingness to pay for this production technology.

Voprosy Ekonomiki,"The form of organization and performance of both the entire supply chain and the markets at its individual links are determined by the structure and mechanisms of vertical interaction of its participants. Most existing approaches to explaining such forms emphasize the differences between hierarchy, market and hybrid contracting. This study specifies the forms of vertical interaction in supply chains and determines the factors of their choice. Supply chain integration on a par with vertical restrictive agreements is proposed to be considered as a form of hybrid contracting. On the basis of the theory of the firm the question of the choice of the form of vertical interaction is considered. It is shown that supply chain integration leads to a fundamental transformation of market multilateral relations into bilateral supply contracts and to the formation of transactional-specific assets which ensure the sustainability of this form of vertical interaction. As a result, compared to market interactions, there is a decrease in transaction costs while control costs increase, so supply chain integration occupies an intermediate place between the market and vertical restrictive agreements.","Petrov S.P., Gilmundinov V.M.",Supply chain integration as a form of vertical interaction in the theory of the firm,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128467551&doi=10.32609%2f0042-8736-2022-3-147-160&partnerID=40&md5=3e08f03d457cbcc2f398fa95266f52e0
Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"The formalization and solution of supplier selection problems (SSPs) based on sustainable (economic, environmental, and social) indicators have become a fundamental tool to perform a strategic analysis of the whole supply chain process and maximize the competitive advantage of firms. Over the last decade, sustainability issues have been often considered in combination with resilient indexes leading to the study of sustainable-resilient supplier selection problems (SRSSPs). The current research on sustainable development, particularly concerned with the strong impact that the recent COVID-19 pandemic has had on supply chains, has been paying increasing attention to the resilience concept and its role within SSPs. This study proposes a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method to solve SRSSPs. The fuzzy best-worst method is used first to determine the importance weights of the selection criteria. A combined grey relational analysis and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is used next to evaluate the suppliers in a fuzzy environment. Triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) are used to express the weights of criteria and alternatives to account for the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent to subjective evaluations. However, the proposed method can be easily extended to other fuzzy settings depending on the uncertainty facing managers and decision-makers. A real-life application is presented to demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed model. Sixteen evaluation criteria are identified and classified as economic, environmental, social, or resilient. The results obtained through the case study show that “pollution control,” “environmental management system,” and “risk awareness” are the most influential criteria when studying SRSSPs related to the manufacturing industry. Finally, three different sensitivity analysis methods are applied to validate the robustness of the proposed framework, namely, changing the weights of the criteria, comparing the results with those of other common fuzzy MCDM methods, and changing the components of the principal decision matrix.","Afrasiabi A., Tavana M., Di Caprio D.",An extended hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision model for sustainable and resilient supplier selection,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123249488&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-021-17851-2&partnerID=40&md5=9fd0be2fd741651b507f2fee5118299d
Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety,"The fourth industrial revolution (I4.0) intends to digitalize the product life cycle using smart technologies interconnected with web-based platforms. I4.0 elements can be employed to enable packaging 4.0 with improved productivity and efficiency. However, the applicability of I4.0 in packaging science has not been fully investigated due to the understanding gap regarding the I4.0 elements in packaging science. In addition, the evolution of market and customers’ demands results in complexity, which requires a business model with a high level of precision. As packaging stays with goods from manufacturing to the consumer stage, the digitalization of the product life cycle using packaging can be realized. Herein, the implications of I4.0 on packaging science are discussed to identify the potential benefits of packaging 4.0 in various sectors, for example, manufacturing, materials, supply chain, retail, and postconsumer. In this study, packaging 4.0 is defined based on a framework comprised of packaging manufacturing, packaging and products, packaging and consumer, and packaging and sustainability (ecologically, economically, and socially). In addition, a decentralized model is introduced to realize a self-controlling concept using decentralized decision-making centers. In this context, packaging 4.0 can be enabled using the combination of horizontal integration of enterprises, vertical integration of enterprises, and end-to-end engineering. Smart devices, for example, sensors, indicators, actuators, and wearable smart devices, interconnected to the internet of things and the cloud is an efficient way to realize a decentralized paradigm. The implementation of an intelligent platform in the packaging 4.0 context enables decentralized data collection in the supply chain, in-store, and postpurchasing stages, which in turn realizes consistent life-cycle monitoring.","Sadeghi K., Kim J., Seo J.",Packaging 4.0: The threshold of an intelligent approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126357429&doi=10.1111%2f1541-4337.12932&partnerID=40&md5=e260686f8736a55a4d34074a367d9c29

Energy,"The global energy landscape is shifting rapidly, with a heightened emphasis on environmental protection. The oil and gas (O&amp;G) industry is one of the biggest environmental polluters, accounting for 10% of all human-produced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its products, including O&amp;G, account for a further 33% of GHG emissions. Therefore, it is high time for the O&amp;G sector to invest in decarbonisation to meet the global climate goal of zero emissions by 2050. This paper identifies 14 strategies to decarbonize the oil and gas supply chain (OGSC) from the extant literature. These 14 strategies pertain to the OGSC upstream, midstream, and downstream. Eight experts from the Iranian OGSC then rank these strategies. The Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method and intuitionistic fuzzy sets are applied to explore the cause-and-effect relationships between decarbonisation strategies. A prominence relationship map is created for each stream in the OGSC to illustrate the influence of each strategy over other strategies. Results reveal that CO2 flooding technology in upstream, renewable energy integration for transport in midstream, and carbon capture, utilisation, and storage systems downstream of OGSC are the most effective for OGSC decarbonisation. The main contribution of this study is to bring forward a supply chain wide examination of decarbonisation strategies as well as the prioritisation of these strategies so that researchers and practitioners can focus on the most promising ones.

The knowledge map of SSCRM is explored in this study using both quantitative and qualitative analysis. A total of 793 articles were retrieved to reveal the knowledge map of SSCRM. Scientometric and context analysis are combined in quantitative analysis to identify the intellectual structure of risk management research related to SSC. Then, a critical review is conducted in qualitative analysis to summarize and analyze the motivations, strategies, approaches, and tools of SSCRM. Combining the quantitative and qualitative analysis results, a conceptual model is constructed for SSCRM from three aspects: (1) risk identification, (2) risk assessment, and (3) risk mitigating and responding. Finally, future research directions are suggested based on the conceptual model for guiding the theories and practice of SSCRM. This study can work as a roadmap for providing appropriate risk management policies and toolkits to SSC, which could advance theoretical thinking on how to mitigate SSC risks.","Wang L., Cheng Y., Wang Z.","Risk management in sustainable supply chain: a knowledge map towards intellectual structure, logic diagram, and conceptual model",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135264602&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-022-22255-x&partnerID=40&md5=edbe0da2f5fbb47266de38ac3d20bd83
Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,"The global supply chain disruption by the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate as over 94% of the top 1000 fortune companies were badly affected. The need for building resilient supply chains to mitigate the effect of such disruptions is rising rapidly than ever before across the global business spectrum. Building resilience in the automotive spare parts (ASPs) supply chain is critically important as any disruption to automotive spares supply chain will affect the operations of the logistics sector, the backbone of global supply chains. This research work contributes to improving the resilience of the automotive spare parts supply chain by proposing a Viable Supply Chain (VSC) framework design that incorporates Additive Manufacturing (AM) enabled trucks in the automotive spares supply chain network. Based on the proposed model, conceptual case models are developed and tested with proposed AM enabled truck manufacturing closer to end customer. A heuristic approach called shortest time heuristic is also proposed to solve the routing and scheduling of an AM enabled truck to deliver customers’ orders of the spare parts through an online platform. Importantly, the study demonstrate how additive manufacturing can help the ASPs industry to switch from the existing practice of make-to-stock to a more efficient inventory management and cost saving make-to-order model while also achieving resilience and sustainability in by providing a source of spares support for discontinued models of vehicles.","Basu R J., Abdulrahman M.D., Yuvaraj M.",Improving agility and resilience of automotive spares supply chain: The additive manufacturing enabled truck model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137644164&doi=10.1016%2fj.seps.2022.101401&partnerID=40&md5=3557bbe37978cd17e5657210f06302f0
Journal of Cleaner Production,"The global supply chain experienced unprecedented disruption due to the Covid-19 crisis in a dynamic world. Consequently, this situation has resulted in many businesses' discontinuity or closure due to disruptions that seriously affect the possibility of maintaining operations, especially micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in emerging markets. In this scenario, the food value chain is deeply concerned because of its vulnerability and importance to food security. Therefore, this study aims to examine the mechanism that enables businesses in the food value chain to overcome the challenging post-pandemic while rebuilding the foundation for long-term viability and sustainable development. Accordingly, this study examines the relationships between the responsible driving factors (towards the environment, society, and the economy) and the food value chain sustainability (FSCS) of MSMEs by exploiting the mediating role of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in an emerging market. This study applies a quantitative research approach using primary data from a questionnaire-based survey. 568 valid responses were received from managers at senior and middle levels. In analysis, this study uses a smart PLS 3.3.2 version, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique, to analyze the structural relationships. The novelty of this study contributes beyond the extant body of knowledge of supply chain management (SCM) by providing a comprehensive approach to promoting FSCS by incorporating socially, environmentally, and economically responsible practices into SCM practices. In addition, this study contributes to broadening the concept of corporate social responsibility by broadening the perspective of sustainability by shifting the enterprise-based perspective to the food value chain-based perspective. Above all, this research provides a new approach to the food value chain in an emerging market that is inherently too challenging to afford the sustainability concept of the food value chain. In sum, the value of this study's contribution is significant to bridging the knowledge-practice gap by providing profound knowledge and an empirically proven framework for the mechanism boosting sustainability for MSMEs in the food value chain in emerging economies. Drawn upon the above highlights, the findings of this study may be of high interest to academics, business practitioners, and policy-makers.","Le T.T., Kieu X.H., Behl A., Pereira V.",Building up more sustainable food supply chains: Implications for sustainable development,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139855744&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.134650&partnerID=40&md5=bb5ea3042580a924da9cbf159786293e
Journal of Cleaner Production,"The global sustainability development mission of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is easy to suggest, but incredibly difficult to put into action. Fortunately, continuing reliance on green conversion technologies could effectively address business concerns of energy expenditures, ecological pollution, and fossil fuel depletion. To promote sustainable practices, many researchers and practitioners have put their hopes in the environment-friendly use of biomass. Biomass supply chain management, which contributes to saving the planet, societies, and costs, has a high potential for sustainable development. Besides, successful implementation of regulatory policies that incorporate tax and incentive strategies into decision-making processes has shifted biomass businesses toward greener practices. To this end, quantitative analytics propose primary tools in developing sustainability-driven decisions for biomass supply chains. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive classification of methodologies applied in this field which incorporate the role of policy mechanisms into managerial decisions. The current study conducts a systematic review of 450 peer-reviewed papers, where we apply a rule-governed content analysis approach that includes collecting, filtering, and categorizing the prior research in a reproducible manner. We also classify the collected materials using deductive and inductive approaches to determine various structural dimensions and associated analytic categories. In the context of biomass supply chain management, we provide evidence that energy crops and forest-based biomass are the most addressed biomass feedstock types in the existing literature, while municipal solid waste sources could be explored further in future research. Additionally, from a sustainability development perspective we show that the environmental pillar has attracted much more attention than the social aspect that accounts for job creation, safe workplace, food security, and consumer surplus.","Jazinaninejad M., Nematollahi M., Shamsi Zamenjani A., Tajbakhsh A.","Sustainable operations, managerial decisions, and quantitative analytics of biomass supply chains: A systematic literature review",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137837579&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.133889&partnerID=40&md5=a4285d9203224e0ba2f5b35c746ca8b5
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The green supply chain (GSC) has become a major trend that advocates for the sustainability of supply chains. To seek optimal strategies for the GSC, the competition between green and nongreen supply chains (NGSCs), along with the impacts of government subsidies and tax policies and the green preferences of consumers, are discussed in this study. A pricing-strategy model of an NGSC and a GSC was conducted by considering the cross-price effects. The equilibrium strategies (the optimal green-technology level, the pricing, and the profits) were achieved and were comparatively analyzed with backward induction. For more in-depth research, a robust sensitivity analysis was conducted, and the Taguchi method was used to identify the main factors that affect the revenues of NGSCs and GSCs. The results show that the vertical collaboration between manufacturers and retailers can help to improve the greenness of products and bring more benefits to consumers. The government interventions have an effect, and when the government sets a premeditated threshold for subsidies and taxation, GSC members can earn more, and the green products obtain more competitiveness. The green preferences of consumers are the primarily conducive factor to the sustainability and profit increases of GSCs. However, the green-technology-investment cost will not have a significant influence on the equilibrium strategies.","Cheng W., Wu Q., Ye F., Li Q.",The Impact of Government Interventions and Consumer Green Preferences on the Competition between Green and Nongreen Supply Chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130345469&doi=10.3390%2fsu14105893&partnerID=40&md5=ff772c773e138d383723e6708318dd27
International Journal of Production Research,"The green vehicle routing problem advised by the global sustainability conscience is a seminal work on the contemporary green research in supply chain management. Inspired by the replete, pollution routing literature, the present work acknowledges the significance of redesigning the logistic networks in a low emission perspective. The present research proposes three logistic models to address the vehicle routing problem of a dairy plant for collecting milk from chilling centres. The first model generates classical, distance centric and economically viable milk pickup plans. In the second model, the environmental friendly routes are generated. The third model is slated to bring a tradeoff between the first two models. The three models are formulated as integer linear programming models and are solved with branch-and-bound based exact algorithm. Owing to the complexity of the NP-hard problem for generating time-bound results, an ant colony optimisation algorithm is designed to solve the models. The performance of the algorithm is further enhanced by introducing a powerful variable neighbourhood search. The computational study on hybrid algorithm reports an average 0.25% improvement from a time interrupted solution of the exact algorithm.

International Journal of Systems Science: Operations and Logistics,"The growing concern of leading a healthy and balanced lifestyle has instigated the rise of the global consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. However, the overall supply chain, particularly the product delivery system, is significantly hampered due to uncertain circumstances, such as a pandemic, natural disaster, and political strikes. Thus, better strategical decisions such as improved and optimised distribution planning have to be made to reduce this wastage and spoilage and ensure sustainability across its chain. Therefore, to ensure a sustainable supply chain architecture, this research proposes a tri-objective optimisation model for multi-echelon and multi-products aiming to lessen the annual supply chain cost, cold storage setup cost, and enhance the freshness of perishable by establishing a proper distribution channel. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model with three competing goals is proposed to solve the supply chain distribution network design problem. Then, to deal with the multi-criteria problem, a weighted sum method is considered. This was solved using CPLEX optimisation studio. A case study is considered to check the feasibility of the model with two common fruits of Bangladesh, i.e. guava and lemon. Finally, several cost-effective options and trade-offs between three factors are presented to aid the decision-making process.

Transport Policy,"The growing concerns about the energy and environmental crisis drive the development of a sustainable society. The electric vehicle (EV) is a potentially clean technology that can contribute to the decarbonization of the transportation sector. However, EVs face obstacles to being diffused and are not prevalent in the global vehicle fleet. Thus, this research identifies the attractiveness, barriers, and solutions for the diffusion of EVs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key agents of the Brazilian supply chain of this technology. Results showed that EVs have essential attractions, but there are barriers to their diffusion in the Brazilian market related to EV cost, charging infrastructure, and public policies. The main solutions to overcome these barriers and expand EV adoption involve: (i) increase of emission consumer awareness through promotional campaigns by government and industry, (ii) tax and non-tax incentives, e.g., reduction of taxation on EV purchase or parts of it, reduction of annual fees or special transit permits for EV, and (iii) technological advances, notably in terms of battery performance and availability and efficiency of charging stations. This research comprises aspects of EV diffusion in Brazil but can serve as guidance for other countries with emerging economies or regions where EV adoption is still incipient.","Ruoso A.C., Ribeiro J.L.D.",An assessment of barriers and solutions for the deployment of electric vehicles in the Brazilian market,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138112311&doi=10.1016%2fj.tranpol.2022.09.004&partnerID=40&md5=7d6fe770b292a58538c4f934ae78889a
Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,"The growing contribution of aviation industry to climate change has led to the search of new energy sources in the short to medium term. Biofuels appear to be a potential alternative to the fossil fuels, also they are a promising solution to mitigate climate change. Nowadays, the agricultural residues (AR) are one of the most promising feedstocks to produce biofuels due to their high availability. However, their use at industrial scale requires overcoming some challenges such as their seasonal availability and their dispersed geographic distribution. In order to face these challenges, in this work has been proposed a multi-period supply chain (SC) to produce bio-jet fuel in Mexico through the alcohol to jet (ATJ) process using corn stover and sugarcane bagasse as raw materials. The supply chain considered implementing a centralized or decentralized configuration as a result of an optimization based on sustainability criteria, such as economic, environmental and social aspects, which are net profit, eco-indicator 99 (EI99) and jobs generation, respectively.

Journal of Remanufacturing,"The growing environmental consciousness, increasing governmental regulations, and need for sustainability have propelled organizations worldwide to adopt a leaner, cleaner, and greener supply chain. In this context, this research paper develops a centrally controlled production-inventory deterministic model over an infinite time horizon for a multi-echelon closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with a product recovery option as remanufacturing. In the proposed model, the retailer at the lowermost echelon experiences a constant demand (D) from the consumers, which is satisfied by the manufacturer and the remanufacturer's alternate replenishment policy (P, R). The supplier procures the raw material in integral batches and ships it to the manufacturer for a finite number of production cycles. In contrast, the remanufacturer collects the returned product from the customer at a fraction of the demand rate. The mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is solved using the classical optimization technique to minimise the system's joint total cost (JTC). Closed-loop expressions for the optimal lot size and optimal shipment policy is obtained for each entity of the CLSC. An algorithm is devised to obtain the optimal value of independent decision variables and sensitivity analysis is carried out to examine the impact of key control parameters on the model performance.","Mawandiya B.K., Patel D., Bansal M., Nagar M., Makhesana M.A., Patel K.M.",Multi-echelon closed-loop supply chain production-inventory model with finite manufacturing and remanufacturing rates,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129679343&doi=10.1007%2fs13243-022-00115-8&partnerID=40&md5=32fe20827ae5840cac598c85ddec4b15
Heliyon,"The growing global concern with sustainability has driven companies to rethink their business model and seek new ways to operate and face this challenge. Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has shown itself capable of contributing to the development or reformulation of organizational processes to make them more competitive and sustainable. Thus, this article aims to propose drivers for the development of corporate sustainability via I4.0. To this end, a literature review and content analysis were used as research methods to identify and analyze, in recent scientific literature, boosting elements that enable organizational processes to become more sustainable via I4.0. Based on these elements, six drivers were systematized and proposed: strategy; product and process design; energy and material resources; people; smart production; and supply chain. Each driver was discussed in light of the scientific literature to generate recommendations for companies to develop the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The main theoretical-scientific contribution of this work is the deepening and expansion of the knowledge block that articulates corporate sustainability with I4.0, which strengthens the basis for the development of new research on these topics and creates a reference for the analysis and discussion of empirical studies. As an applied-managerial contribution, the drivers proposed in this work will provide organizations and their managers with a point of reference to effectively move towards sustainability, making their businesses greener, fairer, and more profitable. A limitation of this study is that the proposed drivers were based on the 30 most cited articles and did not consider other sources, such as documentation from companies. Therefore, for future studies, we suggest increasing the article base and include organizational repositories and identify how SMEs can become sustainable through I4.0 in a way that strengthens the social dimension of sustainability.","Torres da Rocha A.B., Borges de Oliveira K., Espuny M., Salvador da Motta Reis J., Oliveira O.J.",Business transformation through sustainability based on Industry 4.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135505140&doi=10.1016%2fj.heliyon.2022.e10015&partnerID=40&md5=38b61e36aa005508c235446942e4e2af

European Journal of Operational Research,"The high logistics costs of biomass feedstock and the involvement of other firms that use biomass and independent suppliers make feedstock acquisition increasingly difficult for biomass power plants. Governments provide feed-in tariffs (FiT) for biomass power plants to help reduce the negative impacts of high raw material costs. Using a game-theoretic approach, we study the optimal government FiT for biomass power plants and explore the effects of biomass feedstock competition and the presence of independent biomass feedstock suppliers on FiT strategy. Our results show that governments should subsidize biomass power plants whose competitiveness exceeds a certain threshold. The entry of a feedstock competitor into the biomass supply chain raises this threshold, but the involvement of an independent biomass supplier will not. However, the involvement of an independent biomass supplier reduces the efficiency of the FiT. In addition, FiT for biomass power plants should not be provided if government funds are below a certain threshold, as it does not increase social welfare. By comparing FiT with an alternative use of government funds, the technology subsidy, we find that the technology subsidy should be adopted instead of FiT if the government funds are below a threshold.","Li Y., Lin J., Qian Y., Li D.",Feed-in tariff policy for biomass power generation: Incorporating the feedstock acquisition process,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131100000&doi=10.1016%2fj.ejor.2022.05.011&partnerID=40&md5=4a1e2a159068bd906253e063eb086cbd

The pharmaceutical supply chain processes are considered as the mediators and the emerging technology adoption barriers are proposed as the moderators. The study is evaluated using a survey of pharmaceutical companies in India. The findings indicate that manufacturing, distribution and consumption processes in the supply chain mediate the effects of emerging technologies on supply chain performance; however, mediating effects are weakened due to the presence of intricate barriers.

Physics and Chemistry of the Earth,"The impact of COVID-19 on the human population in Malawi has been documented. However, its impact on the animal population and the environment has not been thoroughly researched. Because of the well-known inter-relationship between human and animal populations and the environment, a study based on a brief scooping review of previous related studies, media and survey reports, was conducted. The findings reveal that except for a few selected studies, the research gap on COVID-19's impact on the environment and animals in Malawi is wide compared to other countries. Nonetheless, from the few identified related studies, this study has revealed that as the restriction of movement and closure of borders disrupted the supply chain of forest resources in the country, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased pressure on forests as a coping strategy due to significant loss of jobs in the informal sector. Although the quality of water and air improved in most parts of the globe due to reduced human activity, there is no substantial literature on the same in Malawi partly due to ineffective monitoring systems. However, COVID-19 has exposed the deficiencies in water security in Malawi, thereby creating opportunities to address them. Conversely, increased demand for water at household levels due to restricted movements contributed to environmental pollution at suburb levels. In particular, the less developed and overpopulated countries suffered from land pollution due to poor disposal of plastic generated from hospitals and personal protection equipment. Elsewhere, studies show that minimal human interference with animals outside homes resulted in an increase of fish and bird biomasses. But, unemployment rates caused by the pandemic have seriously contributed to illegal poaching in developing countries. Therefore, a rapid assessment of the impact of the pandemic on environment in Malawi, to generate the evidence needed for policy makers to use in support of the affected and also plan for the recovery and sustainability of wildlife, is recommended.","Mwakilama E., Mboma A., Kafumba-Ngongondo J.","COVID-19, the environment and animal life in Malawi compared to other countries: A brief scooping review for a research agenda in the developing countries",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134355977&doi=10.1016%2fj.pce.2022.103197&partnerID=40&md5=d38be2fa1a389657b47bdd3f768f2c09

These efforts have attempted to overcome the gap between theory and practice while also acknowledging that luxury and CSR can be considered conflicting concepts. This mixed picture underscores the need for further investigations. The current study aims to illuminate CSR in the luxury context by examining business model development and financial performance. In particular, we conducted an in-depth longitudinal and qualitative analysis of a leading luxury company that had experienced an event that had negatively impacted CSR. Specifically, this event affected the supply chain, and the public indignation that ensued impacted the firm's financial performance. Our results revealed that in the case of a luxury organisation, CSR does not affect financial performance despite a negative event. Ultimately, the study offers insights into CSR in the luxury context by proposing a matrix to explain the various influences on a company's business model and financial performance.","Broccardo L., Culasso F., Dhir A., Truant E.",Corporate social responsibility: Does it really matter in the luxury context?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133126444&doi=10.1002%2fcsr.2341&partnerID=40&md5=9333ccf22c239264f7fa74650302baec
Journal of Cleaner Production,"The imperative for building a sustainable future depends on how organizations manage their supply chains, which are responsible for processing raw materials into finished products. Recently, a new trend has been emerging in some companies, considering not only an entire supply chain but several supply chains inside the organization. This way of approaching sustainability, by focusing on several supply chains, can be called a multiple supply chain perspective, and professionals’ interest in this context has been growing. This study aims to explore essential components needed to manage multiple supply chains toward sustainability from a focal company perspective. Sustainability reports from 25 companies leaders in supply chain management are analyzed using content analysis and correspondence analysis. As a result, a conceptual model is proposed, considering four essential components: supply chain processes; relational mechanisms; monitoring and control mechanisms; and sustainability outcomes. Based on this conceptual model, six propositions are elaborated to be further empirically explored in the literature. The proposed conceptual model helps supply chain and sustainability managers to improve their efforts toward sustainability by revealing what components are needed to manage each different supply chain and by helping to create more focused strategies that are effective in different scenarios.","Brandao M.S., Godinho-Filho M.",Is a multiple supply chain management perspective a new way to manage global supply chains toward sustainability?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138822436&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.134046&partnerID=40&md5=3bc2c32985da58a221ea100c9b0bcd1d
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The importance of supporting agricultural mechanization in agri-food supply chains to achieve agricultural and rural development has been comprehensively recognized. There has been a surge in the attention given to Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization (SAM) in the context of developing countries. However, it is important to address the major challenge of studying the important factors and the influencing path of SAM. As a representative province of China’s agricultural development, Hubei has developed significantly in terms of agricultural mechanization in the past 20 years. Therefore, using a literature review, representative field survey data, and statistical analytical approaches, 28 relevant factors related to SAM were extracted, and the main influencing factors of SAM were determined by building an integrative conceptual framework and using the corresponding structural equation model based on partial least squares (PLS-SEM). The relationships and influencing paths between the factors were analyzed, and a confirmatory measurement model and a structural model of the effects on sustainable agricultural mechanization were constructed. The results show that (1) the PLS-SEM model fits the experimental data well and can effectively reflect the relationships among factors in this complex system; (2) within the factors influencing the development level of SAM in Hubei, China, the economic factors have the greatest weight, whereas government policy factors are the core elements promoting development, and environmental factors are the most noteworthy outcome factors; and (3) economic and policy factors play a very obvious role in promoting SAM through the influencing paths of agricultural production and agricultural machinery production and sales. Ultimately, corresponding suggestions have been put forward for decisions regarding the implementation of SAM for similar countries and regions.","Li Z., Zhu M., Huang H., Yi Y., Fu J.","Influencing Factors and Path Analysis of Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization: Econometric Evidence from Hubei, China",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128744097&doi=10.3390%2fsu14084518&partnerID=40&md5=eaa9d083212dddd4575e0789977352b0
Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"The importance of sustainability in supply chain contracts is not concealed, and there has been a great deal of effort to address some types of supply sustainability issues. Another issue that has been added to this view today is the issue of risk, which we have addressed in this article as supply risk. We have actually tried to combine two supply contracts such as revenue sharing and buyback with these parameters and link the new concepts to the supply chain. Then, we examine the types of risks and their relationship to supply contracts and develop a model based on which the model somehow expresses the relationship between the two contracts clearly. Finally, by some of the Regression analysis, we examined the existing parameters and their role in profit and change variables. The proposed model used Stackelberg game theory.

International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"The importance of sustainability in supply chain management is growing worldwide. It is possible to find reasons for this using various phenomena that negatively affect humanity, e.g., climate change, scarce materials, supply disruptions, and complex fossil fuel dependency. Because of that, is extremely important to constantly look for new ways to systematically increase sustainability in enterprises and their logistics and supply chain processes by considering different stakeholders and influential factors. Therefore, this paper explores how different types of organizational culture and normative commitment impact sustainability and each other in business logistics and supply chains and develops a conceptual model to manage this challenge. Gaining new insights is valuable especially for managers to obtain better information on how to improve sustainability not just by integrating green technologies but mainly by changing culture, attitude, and perception in their enterprises. The research is focused on employees from global logistics or related branches in micro, small, medium, and large enterprises with the primary activity mostly related to manufacturing, transport, and storage. The findings are based on the questionnaire which was sent directly to 1576 employees from 528 enterprises. A total of 516 employees from enterprises that are mostly located in 34 countries responded to requests for participation. The results reveal statistically significant positive and negative impacts, e.g., clan culture has a positive statistically significant impact on the sustainable development of supply chains. Most of the connections to the eighth Sustainable Development Goal by the United Nations (decent work and economic growth) were also found, which was the enterprise’s highest priority with a share of 52.99%.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"The increase of renewable energy production worldwide, occurred in the last years, is also attributable to some agroforestry species cultivated according to the short rotation coppice technique. Although these species are able of enhancing abandoned or marginal land leading to numerous environmental benefits, an increasing number of farmers are introducing them in place of agricultural crops. Therefore, since for a farmer economic sustainability is one of the main factors to introduce a biomass crop, the study aimed at evaluating the profitability of Paulownia, a species that has been spreading in recent years. In particular, an economic analysis has been carried out in a Southern Italian farm in which Paulownia has recently replaced a vineyard, by adopting a discounted cash flow approach. The results show that the Paulownia for both timber and woodchip production, with an annual gross margin equal to 357.91 € ha−1, can represent a valid alternative compared to wine grape (237.41 € ha−1), while Paulownia for exclusively biomass production has almost zero profitability (4.22 € ha−1).

ECS Transactions,"The increased impacts of climatic changes and global warming has led many organizations to adopt green initiatives in several areas of their business processes. Many multinational companies are moving towards reduction of carbon emission across its various operations. Carbon neutrality is the process where steps are taken to achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions. This article proposes measures to achieve carbon neutrality across the supply chain globally. As part of its sustainability initiative, organizations have decided to reduce carbon consumption across their plants. This calls for estimation of carbon dioxide emissions and reducing the carbon footprint in the entire supply chain process. It also involves gauging Green House CO2 emissions during the transportation process for all TMC regions and Transportation models used by various companies. The main calculations include total CO2 emissions, CO2 Emissions per Ton. Of Goods Transported, CO2 Emissions per Transport Km. These calculations are done based on factors such as Full Truck Load, Less Truck Load, Sea mode of transportation and Air mode of transportation. An analysis is performed on the resulting calculation figures for different modes of transportation such as road, air and sea. The analysis shows that there is an increase in overall CO2e for Air mode of transportation. The least increase in overall Co2 is Sea mode of transportation.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"The increasing population and income inequality in the last decades have made it necessary to focus on the concept of sustainability. In the changing world order, with economic crises, instabilities, pandemics, and social media, sustainability awareness differs significantly from past years. In addition, developing new technologies and concepts (big data, blockchain, IoT, robotic, etc.) plays a crucial role in meeting social awareness in terms of sustainability. Food sustainability is also one of the most important pillars in this concept. The integration of new technologies in agriculture and food chains will enable the current world population to use resources more efficiently and sustainably. Blockchain, one of the technologies that emerged with the arrival of Industry 4.0, is a technology that can be used effectively in many sectors. Particularly in supply chain networks, it is seen as a technology that supports the sustainability concept due to its features such as decentralization, reliability, transparency, consensus standards, and traceability. However, since blockchain is an immature and new technology, there are some challenges with integrating it into existing conventional systems. This study aims to present a conceptual framework for the integration of blockchain technology to establish a sustainable tea supply chain, define possible actions, and prioritize the possible risks that may arise in this integration process; this will be done through the Spherical Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (SF-AHP) approach. In this context, initially, the current tea supply chain will be considered and the activities carried out will be defined in terms of technological, environmental, and strategic sustainability. Then, the design that includes the integration of all activities with blockchain technology is presented. The proposed design covers the entire tea supply chain from end to end and is considered with regard to all sustainability dimensions. In the proposed framework, barriers that may be encountered and risks that may arise at each stage of the tea supply chain process are identified; managerial implications are then presented to eliminate these risks. To enhance the use of the recommendations made, risks and barriers are prioritized with SF-AHP management. Thus, the problems that need to be solved primarily in the technological transformation process can be evaluated more clearly. The proposed theoretical framework is expected to extend to all agricultural practices and support technological advances throughout the agricultural sector.","Mangla S.K., Kazançoğlu Y., Yıldızbaşı A., Öztürk C., Çalık A.",A conceptual framework for blockchain-based sustainable supply chain and evaluating implementation barriers: A case of the tea supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126877481&doi=10.1002%2fbse.3027&partnerID=40&md5=37d464d0f177e4ee01a4527f8300ea60
Frontiers in Public Health,"The increasing threat of emerging and re-emerging pathogens calls for a shared vision toward developing and maintaining global surveillance mechanisms to enable rapid characterization of pathogens, a foundational requirement for effective outbreak response. Efforts establishing new surveillance programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have repeatedly led to siloed systems that prove unsustainable or ineffective due to narrowly focused approaches, competing priorities, or lack of resourcing. Barriers inherent to LMICs, such as resource limitations, workforce strain, unreliable supply chains, and lack of enduring champions exacerbate implementation and sustainability challenges. In order to improve adoption and endurance of new surveillance programs, more effective design and implementation of programs is needed to adequately reflect stakeholder needs and simultaneously support population-level disease monitoring and clinical decision-making across a range of chronic and acute health issues. At the heart of this cross-sectorial integration between clinical care and public health initiatives are emerging technologies and data modalities, including sequencing data. In this prospective, we propose an implementation strategy for genomics-based surveillance initiatives in LMICs founded on the use of a target operating model. Adoption of a target operating model for the design and implementation of genomic surveillance programs will ensure programs are agile, relevant, and unified across diverse stakeholder communities, thereby increasing their overall impact and sustainability.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The increasing use of e-commerce introduces major challenges for last-mile delivery, which is critical to ensure smooth functioning of supply chains. Besides the speed and cost of delivery, which are the most important factors for last-mile logistics, environmental and social sustainability factors are taking on an increasingly important role, especially in urban areas. In this perspective, last-mile delivery by drones could be a good choice both in terms of transport speed and sustainability. Being electrically powered, drones can reduce environmental impact; moreover, they enable the reduction of road congestion since they do not interfere with land infrastructures. The goal of this study is to analyse the viability of drones for last-mile delivery in the Italian city of Milan. A stated preference survey was carried out to assess end-user propensity towards drones. Using these results, a goods delivery service by drones was designed. Furthermore, a preliminary financial analysis was performed to evaluate the benefits for a company that would provide such a transport service. Findings show that last-mile delivery by drones can be successfully used to deliver small and light packages, reducing environmental and social impacts, and ensuring profits for the transport provider.","Borghetti F., Caballini C., Carboni A., Grossato G., Maja R., Barabino B.","The Use of Drones for Last-Mile Delivery: A Numerical Case Study in Milan, Italy",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124939213&doi=10.3390%2fsu14031766&partnerID=40&md5=40cabbabed3617f51abf657c5ddc91f3

The prominence of sustainability in Indian automobile industry supply chains has become of utmost importance to be prepared for the future ahead. Despite industry commitment towards sustainability the management lacks direction when it comes to implementation. The study aims to find out factors that contribute to sustainability in the supply chain management of the automobile industry. A systematic review was conducted to explore different social, economic and environmental factors and sub-factors, extensively used for measuring the dimensions of sustainability. A total of 42 respondents were taken from seven Indian automobile industries for measuring sustainability. Further, the identified factors and sub-factors are ranked through the PPS (Percentage Point Score) method. A conceptual framework was developed to show the sub-factors impacts three dimensions of sustainability. Thus, three hypotheses were created and further tested. The study shows that the environmental factor has a more influence on a sustainable initiative with the highest score of 90 points (indicates first rank), followed by economic factor with 67 points (second rank) and social factor has 61 points (third rank). Thus, it was determined which factor or sub-factor is more important and priority than others.

Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,"The industry transition towards digital transformation opens the possibilities to utilize data for enhancing sustainability in industrial operations and build capabilities towards resilient and circular operations, i.e., shift towards industry 5.0. This paper explores how data-driven decision-making (DDDM) can enable sustainable and resilient supply chain operations within the manufacturing industry. A series of in-depth interviews were conducted with experts, researchers, and company representatives across the manufacturing industry and universities in Sweden. The findings show a consensus among companies, researchers, and literature about the potential of data utilization for sustainability purposes; however, in most cases, the complete transformation towards data-driven has not happened yet. Companies have uncertainty about what data is needed rather than its lack. Reliability & validity of data become essential to exploit the potential of the data organizations already possess.

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"The influence of an unorganized sector or micro-retailers in the financial system and sustainable development are becoming highly significant in several countries. Regardless of the fact that such retailers are generally reliant on wholesalers for commerce, the consequences of mediators in green supply chain management have received little attention in the existing studies. A three-tier based green supply chain(GSC) is considered in this study which consists of a manufacturer, a wholesaler and a retailer. The purpose of this investigation is to provide a decision-making structure for the identification and useful implementation of sustainable products by making comparisons of member profits, greening levels, retail prices, and ecological impact under various game structures. A two-period system is introduced to analyze the three-game strategies, especially MS, WS, and RS games. Then a two-period centralized system was implemented. The best possible feasible solution is obtained by comparing the optimal decisions in each game structure and the centralized model. The overall profit of the supply chain and the level of the greening of the products are significantly more significant in the centralized system than in any other game structure. The supply chain members could indeed make compromises on their marginal profit goals to achieve sustainable development. The results may help the supply chain members to implement more sustainability initiatives.","Das M., Jana D.K., Alam S.",Comparative study of centralized and decentralized scenarios of a three-tiered green supply chain in two-period using the game theoretical approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135380141&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2022.100054&partnerID=40&md5=9f2611fa51334077c4bd8eeb4b21825d

The purpose and academic contribution of the paper is to conduct the first systematic review of existing institutional economics frameworks that can be applied to explore sustainable development. The scientific value added of the review is to draw out, cluster, compare and contrast: the focus, contribution, use and institutional approaches of studies, as well as sector applicability, aims of sustainable development addressed and key gaps. Results show that most frameworks can be classed as applying new institutional economics approaches (or similar) and focus on common property or social ecological systems. Most of these frameworks see institutions as rules and often have a strong focus on formal rules. Another key finding is that most frameworks address the environmental aim of sustainable development, but few address all three aims. There was also found to be a lack of frameworks with a foreground focus on the end consumer and downstream supply chains that drive resources use and environmental impact. Classical institutional economics is largely neglected by most frameworks, yet classical institutional economics can inform the cultural shift to more sustainable economies, because of its focus on a wider range of informal institutions.",Bradley P.,An exploration of institutional approaches in pursuing sustainable development,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123020605&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2021.12.010&partnerID=40&md5=9893d422a0ce4773f9a57c6335224b43
Supply Chain Forum,"The integration of actors into Supply Chain Management (SCM) is currently becoming more and more crucial. All actors, including suppliers, manufacturers, customers, consumers and users have a role to play in the company’s performance. Customers, consumers and users have become major actors in the Supply Chain (SC). Their active integration into the SCM is becoming a new challenge for companies. This article aims to take stock of what has been done on the integration of customers, consumers, and users in SCM, in the literature, and to propose future avenues of research. A bibliometric analysis is conducted to study the integration of downstream actors. The analysis provides details on the most cited articles, published authors and influential journals using Bibexcel, and then Gephi is used to create a network. This article first proposes a quantitative analysis of the literature by highlighting the best authors, articles and journals on the integration of downstream actors in SCM. Subsequently, a network analysis reveals five clusters and the challenges to come. Finally, we suggest how and to what end these actors might be integrated.

IEEE Engineering Management Review,"The integration of Surplus Asset Management (SAM) with the circular economy (CE) provides a solution to optimize the use of resources, assets, and equipment throughout their life cycle, enabling new business models, increasing profitability, achieving sustainability goals, and plus reducing obsolescence and waste. We introduce the CE-SAM as a business approach to create value by extending the life cycles of discarded useful equipment. We distinguish four types of value: 1) sourcing value, 2) customer value, 3) information value, and 4) environmental value. Carbon footprints can be reduced by up to 80% by redeploying equipment depending on residual value and customer needs. CE-SAM can be a business game changer if it is integrated as part of the business strategy. The implementation challenges can be best tackled through the collaboration of different actors along the value chain, depending on their capabilities and capacity. REUZEit, a case study company, provides a feasible case study that services life science and pharmaceutical companies to optimize the use of their resources, assets, and equipment, to reduce obsolescence, waste, and increase profit at the same time.","Krikke H., Coronado Palma N., Shell J., Andrews J.",Circular Economic Surplus Asset Management: A Game Changer in Life Sciences,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135484950&doi=10.1109%2fEMR.2022.3174634&partnerID=40&md5=ee8d292da8f9bfc76a3d2cad6743b762
Cuadernos de Gestion,"The interest of this study lies in the fact that the transition from a linear to a circular economy is of key interest in relevant business and academic fields, although the circular economy is an emerging issue and theoretical and empirical research has been limited until recently. However, circular business models are receiving more and more attention, and it is therefore strategically necessary to develop tools that facilitate their implementation. Therefore, because of increasing interest amongst research in the circular economy and sustainability, the purpose of the present study and its strength lies in the systematic presentation of both of these specific academic streams. The approach was qualitative and based on a systematic literature review. We examined several areas in which the circular economy has a place. We highlight sustainability, consumer behaviour, innovation, remanufacturing, operations management, supply chains, intellectual capital, 3D printing, big data, and recycling. We also consider drivers, challenges, the relationship between circular economy and small to medium-sized enterprises, and the influence of circular economy in specific sectors such as textiles and food. It is hoped that the study will facilitate a possible sustainable solution that contrasts with the current linear model of production and resource management.

Procedia Computer Science,"The interest towards Industry 4.0 is growing since its inception. Its introduction has many impacts on the whole supply chain and requires companies to rethink the way they design and manage their supply chain. In particular, companies usually are not able to develop innovation by exclusively relying only on their internal resources. As a consequence, firms are increasingly collaborating with external stakeholders (i.e., suppliers, manufacturers and customers). This led to state that companies are more and more adopting an open innovation model. The objective of this paper is to investigate the topic of Industry 4.0 under an Open innovation lens. Specifically, based on a systematic literature review conducted on 50 papers, three thematic areas have been identified namely, innovation, smartness, sustainability. These trends have been confirmed by means of a multiple case study, involving three companies operating within the Italian food supply chain.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"The issue of food waste has received increased attention in recent years, from both researchers and practitioners, due to the unethical and negative environmental implications of wasting food. Recovering waste effectively depends on existing or emergent relationships between food waste generators and receivers that facilitate food redistribution. Although previous studies have identified the importance of the relational aspect for achieving circularity, the extant literature has not yet fully explored redistribution in practice. The present study fills this void by exploring the formation of relationships for food redistribution that enhance circularity at the end of the food supply chain through 18 interviews in the food donor–receiver dyad. The results of the study reveal four categories – (1) ongoing redistribution, (2) sporadic redistribution, (3) the establishment of new relationships, and (4) relationship imbalance – that highlight that redistribution is supply-driven and thereby depends on a highly responsive demand side.

Projects for development of mineral resources are inextricably linked with river transport. However, inland waterway transport, taking a direct part in the creation of transport infrastructure of land transport, has created competitors in the form of road transport and the railway. Currently, development of river transport is dependent on the emergence of large investment projects and approaches to transport support. The drive towards sustainability in the inland waterway transport sector has been very high lately. The shipping management practice has shown that sustainable development can be achieved through the creation of our own technological processes. A more productive approach is to determine the place of shipping company in the supply chain. The necessity of creating a supply chain, taking into account peculiarities of water transport infrastructure, in particular, waterways, is shown. The article identifies indicators of quality of transport and these indicators become a benchmark for inland water transport.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The jamu (Indonesian traditional herbal drink) industry has grown in popularity because of people’s increased interest in the qualities of herbal remedies for bodily immunity. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected not only the market but also how businesses have managed their supply chains and production. COVID-19 has been claimed to be a test of a company’s long-term viability. Sustainability refers to a company’s ability to last a long time (corporate longevity). The tug of war between economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social justice that guarantees enterprises are profitable and sustainable is the main issue for companies in developing governance. From a theoretical standpoint, longevity is an intriguing problem. There are two types of corporate longevity: corporate longevity (CL) and corporate sustainable longevity (CSL). Little research has specifically examined the internal aspects of CSL. It necessitates several specific characteristics that all play a role in CSL. This research intends to highlight operational resilience as a crucial predictor of CSL’s significance in the jamu business. Companies that have consistently produced and benefitted from their business operations, before, during, and after the pandemic, have faced challenges of sustainability or longevity. Predecessor independent variables, and moderating or mediating variables, can be used to enable the operational resilience stance. To achieve CSL, the company must know how much it will determine its position in numerous ways in company practice. This study contributes to exploring dimensions and indicators of operational resilience to determine CSL in its relevance to the jamu industry. Different roles for operational resilience in different industry practices are also feasible.","Irawan D., Prabowo H., Kuncoro E.A., Thoha N.",Operational Resilience as a Key Determinant of Corporate Sustainable Longevity in the Indonesian Jamu Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131581727&doi=10.3390%2fsu14116431&partnerID=40&md5=79ca37c4a1d13244b21dfaf180547e18

The coordination of forward and backward supply chain becomes difficult due to the players' self-interest and firmographics. It becomes much complicated when we consider the triple bottom line of sustainability (TBLS) in the supply chain. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Industry 4.0 (I4.0) based virtual organization model for the coordination of the forward and backward supply chain. The results obtained through virtual organization model are also compared with the centralized supply chain and traditional cost-sharing contract. The results reveal that virtual organization model can perform better than the price only contract and it will be help firms in achieving greater sustainability with respect to traditional contract mechanisms.","Kumar P., Sharma D., Pandey P.",Industry 4.0 (I4.0) Based Virtual Organization Model for the Coordination of Sustainable Textile Supply Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130915244&doi=10.37625%2fabr.25.1.186-208&partnerID=40&md5=03e54983fe36750545dc334ec11d9527
Journal of Sustainable Metallurgy,"The largest outputs of rare earth mining are the low-value byproducts cerium and lanthanum, which burden rare earth supply chains because they must be separated from more desirable rare earths used in magnet production. Promoting demand for cerium and lanthanum can potentially diversify the economics of rare earth mining and improve supply chain stability for all rare earth elements. A promising avenue for increasing byproduct rare earth element demand is their use in aluminum alloys; an application for cerium and lanthanum offering multiple benefits to manufacturing such as energy reduction and improved throughput. Experimental materials science and economic implications of Al-rare earth element alloys will be discussed. We show that Al–La/Ce alloys have elevated mechanical strength compared to more traditional aluminum alloys, in some formulations can be used without heat treatment, and possess a highly castable eutectic microstructure.

Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,"The leather industry typically generates a large amount of wastewater. Leather production requires large quantities of freshwater and various chemicals are added to the water at every stage of production. The absence of proper regulatory bodies and specialized treatment plants to recycle the wastewater add to the environmental hazards caused by the industry. Due to the problems cited above and the significant cost of safe wastewater disposal, numerous manufacturers illegally discharge their chemically polluted wastewater, causing immeasurable damage to the environment and public health. Governments' failure to adopt suitable taxation and subsidy policies further aggravates the crisis and discourages manufacturers from transitioning toward sustainable production practices. As a result, the majority of manufacturers are on the brink of bankruptcy. In this study, we propose a model for a leather industry supply chain that incorporates the three pillars of sustainability which include economic viability, environmental protection, and social equity. The proposed model features flexible governmental policies and enacts a Stackelberg competition between the producers and retailers under both certain and uncertain conditions in the context of the Iranian leather industry to ensure maximum customer satisfaction. To verify the applicability of the model, it was applied to a real-world case study under uncertainty. In the end, the validity of the model was confirmed when the results were approved by a panel of industry experts.","Fakheri S., Bahrami-Bidoni Z., Makui A., Pishvaee M.S., Santibanez Gonzalez E.D.",A sustainable competitive supply chain network design for a green product under uncertainty: A case study of Iranian leather industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137050328&doi=10.1016%2fj.seps.2022.101414&partnerID=40&md5=9b544b64167a7cedb8a1427e98e089e5
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"The linear flow of production causes several problems, mainly concerning the environmental pillar of sustainability. In logistics, a more circular and green production system is linked to the implementation of Green Logistics (GL), which aims to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, the use of fossil energy sources and the return of materials after their end-of-life. Given the need to reduce the environmental damage of plastic packaging used in the production system, the present study uses a tool to evaluate the performance of GL in the plastic sector to help improve environmental performance within organizations and reduce negative environmental impact. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used with specialists to rank 27 green practices and indicators of the developed tool. Subsequently, the indicators were normalized to create a unified index of the GL in organizations. The tool was applied in two companies of the plastic packaging chain. Results show that some areas of green logistics are being overlooked when companies approach environmental sustainability, thus compromising the progress towards GL. In contrast, the green transportation category presents the worst results, followed by green stocking, green packaging and reverse logistics. Discussions and suggestions for future research on the subject are also drawn. This study presents a practical tool that will help practitioners easily evaluate companies' GL using a unified index.","de Souza E.D., Kerber J.C., Bouzon M., Rodriguez C.M.T.",Performance evaluation of green logistics: Paving the way towards circular economy,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127389093&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2021.100019&partnerID=40&md5=3fd473865e19cb9850e8e65e5d1dc78a
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"The literature already discussed about how the synergic implementation of Circular Economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigms in industrial contexts could enable improvements in Supply Chain (SC) efficiency and competitiveness. However, the experts concentrated on a single topic of circular supply chain (CSC), CE, and I4.0, lacking a systemic approach to the integrated context. To this aim, the paper proposes a systematic literature review investigating and systematizing the knowledge around the circular SC domain enabled by CE and I4.0 and, simultaneously, highlighting the major trends. Starting from six dimensions of analysis (Type of contribution, LC phases, I4.0 technologies, Triple Bottom Line (TBL) layers, CE strategies, and SC typologies), CSC-related articles have been classified basing on five thematic categories (I4.0 enabling technologies, Performance tools and indicators, Challenges and barriers, Business models and strategies, Best practices). Results allowed to provide some peculiarities of each category. From a sustainability side, they confirmed a predominance of economic and environmental aspects over social ones, together with a life cycle perspective. From an I4.0 side, they shown a prevalence and a synergic implementation of internet of things, big data analytics, and cloud technologies. From a CE strategy side, reuse-recycle-remanufacturing, waste management, material and energy efficiency have been identified as prevalent topics. The paper contributes in building an integrated knowledge of the threefold CE, CSC and I4.0 research context.

Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,"The long-term impact of global warming and the resulting climate crisis, brought about by human-induced emission of greenhouse gases, is an imminent environmental concern. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperature rise to below 2° C over pre-industrial levels, to curb this impact. Meeting this limit necessitates reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, which imply no net transport of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The chemical process industry along with associated manufacturing industries such as iron and steel, cement and aluminum contributes significantly towards global carbon dioxide emissions. Mapping the precise routes of Carbon mobilization is the first step towards establishment of a sustainable, circular and Carbon neutral chemical industry. There exist no C flow models for aforementioned energy intensive industries. Current published literature also does not account for C mobilized to meet the energetic needs of global chemical processes. They also do not account for the emissions offset by material exchange between different production processes. In this work, we develop a steady state model of Carbon flow through chemical process and associated industries. Our model traces the flow of carbon from fossil feedstock, to energy carriers and chemical intermediates, and finally valuable products, by-products and emissions. This model makes use of process data, life-cycle inventories models developed by existing studies on the chemical and petrochemical industries, government databases, greenhouse gas emissions data and economy models. Fundamental laws like mass and energy balance are used in conjunction with stoichiometric calculations to estimate missing data and reconcile incorrect data. We represent this model as a Sankey Diagram to better facilitate visualization of the process network and identify scope of process improvement. We elaborate how this model helps the placement of process alternatives such as use of renewables, electrification, green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage in the value chain. These alternatives can be highly energy intensive, requiring a large amount of “net zero” electricity to function. The dependence of renewably sourced electricity on land area availability necessitates its efficient use. Thus, the integration of fossil alternatives in the model paves the path for their targeted and optimal usage towards decarbonization.","Sen A., Stephanopoulos G., Bakshi B.R.",Mapping Anthropogenic Carbon Mobilization through Chemical Process and Manufacturing Industries,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136249237&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-323-85159-6.50092-0&partnerID=40&md5=c1fb8b9ae28a86af1cd397a48a57d80a
Journal of Cleaner Production,"The main aim of designing a supply chain network (SCN) is to develop chain profitability and customer satisfaction. The appropriate design of this network plays a crucial role in obtaining the goals of the supply chain, in particular, the level of responsiveness and efficiency. This paper reports on designing a resilient and sustainable biomass supply network by an optimization method based on the uncertainty in bio-energy demand and the disruption in the bio-refinery. First, the relation between resilience factors and sustainability indicators is determined by specifying the critical resilience factors and sustainability indicators of the biomass supply chain (BMSC). Then, the practical resilience factors in the BMSC are prioritized through multi-criteria decision method (MCDM). The factors of higher priority are considered in the proposed model. The objective function is of a profit maximization type. A robust approach is proposed for overcoming the uncertainty in bioenergy demand. The results of solving models by General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software, are given for representing the model applicability.

Packaging plays a key role in food and beverage production and supply chain, but the increasing volume of packaging used causes many environmental concerns. The wine sector is no exception, especially in Italy that is the largest producer in the world. Eight packaging alternatives were compared in environmental and economic terms assuming a functional unit of three litres and a cradle to grave approach: one aseptic carton system, two bag-in-box systems, two PET bottle systems, and three glass bottle systems. The results were analysed with an eco-efficiency portfolio approach. There was consistency between the LCA and LCC results for most of the packaging systems. From both the environmental and economical point of views, aseptic cartons and bag-in-box systems were the most sustainable alternatives, while the glass systems had the worst global performances due to the high weight and consequent huge energy consumption during bottle production.

Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers the opportunity to decentralize the supply chain and manufacture on-demand without minimum order quantities. While AM could improve sustainability, it also could lead to less eco-efficient localized production or problem shifting within the value chain. To enable a holistic decision support for the changeover to AM, a multi-level framework for the interdisciplinary assessment of AM in spare parts supply is developed and enhanced by an agent-based modelling approach for quantitative assessment.","Mindt N., Dér A., Wiese M., Mennenga M., Herrmann C.",Multi-level Framework for the Assessment of Additive Manufacturing for Spare Parts Supply,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127484116&doi=10.1016%2fj.procir.2022.02.069&partnerID=40&md5=c4c690bf92144bd951df065736246dae
International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"The main objective of the study was to compare young consumer purchasing behaviour towards organic food in Poland (PL) and the United Kingdom (UK), countries with different levels of organic market maturity. The study was conducted by means of an online survey questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic between December 2020 and February 2021. The sample consisted of 862 PL and 161 UK consumers. 31% of PL respondents and 58.4% of UK respondents indicated they purchase organic products. Descriptive statistics, the Mann–Whitney U test and the two proportion Z test were used for statistical analyses. The results indicate that young consumers pay particular attention to the freshness and quality of consumed products. Concern for their own health and that of their loved ones, as well as the desire to eat better-quality products were the main motivations for the respondents to purchase organic products. Organic vegetables and fruits, eggs, dairy products, and meat and meat products, were among the most frequently purchased products in the studied cohorts. Experts (e.g., a dietitian, physician) were declared to be the first source of information concerning food products for young consumers. Next, family members were indicated. Social media content (PL respondents) and information from websites managed by institutions (UK respondents) were mentioned as the third source. UK consumers preferred short supply chains. The present study can be used by government bodies and companies to select the most effective communication channels for education and advertising and to develop effective commercial strategies aimed at young consumers.","Wojciechowska-Solis J., Kowalska A., Bieniek M., Ratajczyk M., Manning L.",Comparison of the Purchasing Behaviour of Polish and United Kingdom Consumers in the Organic Food Market during the COVID-19 Pandemic,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122969050&doi=10.3390%2fijerph19031137&partnerID=40&md5=d0e68bbce0767c36e059ca83753bdf05
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"The main purpose of this study is to identify the Logistics 4.0 service quality (L4.0SQ) criteria and to investigate the effectiveness of emerging technologies as sustainability and value-creating enablers on improving the quality of logistics services. In this regard, first, according to the literature review and using the opinion of industrial and academic experts, the criteria for measuring the logistics 4.0 services quality were classified into two groups: Competitive Lever and Social Value Creator. So that nine criteria were in the Competitive Lever group and five criteria were in the Social Value Creator group. Then, using the Group Grey BWM method, the importance of each of the extracted criteria was determined. In the next step, based on the selected criteria, the impact of each of the sustainability enablers on the logistics 4.0 services quality in the form of different scenarios using Improved Grey Relational Analysis (IGRA) was investigated. The findings show that among the sustainability enablers studied, artificial intelligence (S8), advanced robotics (S4), blockchain (S7) and additive manufacturing (S3) as the most important enablers in the Logistics 4.0 service quality. The results of this study provide a good guide for companies and managers to measure and improve the quality of logistics 4.0 services quality to address the challenges of traditional supply chain and logistics.

Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,"The manufacturing industries of India are facing the global pressure to adopt the sustainable supply chain management practices. While there are some studies related to manufacturing industries across the world to examine the barriers but these studies are from developed nations. There are very fewer studies which are on manufacturing industries and from developing nations. To bridge this gap, it is very important to identify the critical barriers which influence the implementation of sustainable supply chain management in the manufacturing industries of India. Therefore, this study identifies the critical barriers in the implementation of sustainable supply chain management practices. There are total nine critical barriers found out after literature review and experts opinions from the industries and academia. Total ten manufacturing industries dealing in the automobile sectors were targeted to collect the data and responses collected from the both academia and industry. Further data is synthesized and AHP method is applied to rank the barriers and evaluate the effect of the barriers on the SSCM implementation. Cost of the sustainability and economical conditions in the manufacturing industries is found to be most influencing barrier among all the barriers. The findings of this study aims to support the Indian manufacturing industries in the structural way so that policy makers and managers from the manufacturing industries can identify the most influencing barrier and work in future to eliminate that for the implementation of SSCM in their business practices to achieve business excellence.

Journal of Thermal Spray Technology,"The market needs for increased engine efficiency and environmentally friendly solutions remain the key drivers for the aerospace industry. These efficiency gains will be achieved by meeting the challenges of higher engine operating temperatures, weight reduction, and novel surface solutions for increased component longevity. A critical question to address is if the thermal spray (TS) industry can continue to meet the challenges and demands seen by the airlines and the engine manufacturers. In addition to non-aerospace influences, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected the landscape of industry growth, not only directly on airlines but also on the associated supply chain. This article reviews this market, its suppliers, and identifies the challenges and opportunities for future growth. Primary focus is on technology and what will be required to bring about reliable, robust, and cost-effective TS solutions into the marketplace. Several issues affecting the global landscape of the aerospace industry are discussed including (1) sustainability, (2) technology, (3) cost of ownership, (4) evolving marketplace, (5) workforce and behavior, and (6) supply chain vitality. An important question to address is if the TS industry can accelerate development with its supply chain and have the ability to commercialize technology more efficiently. Despite the market setbacks from the pandemic and previous issues with the Boeing 737 MAX fleet, the aerospace industry is poised to make significant advancements. These will create new opportunities for thermal spray technology in materials, equipment, and processes. To deliver on them, the implementation of Industry 4.0 along with the investment in human resources is more critical than ever.

Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,"The motivations and barriers of the actual green purchase behavior are as real as the product itself, which makes it a systematic process to examine the inconsistency between consumers' motivations and their actual behavior (motivation-behavior gap). The study aimed to clarify the direct and indirect effects of motivations on the purchase behavior of green food. The proposed conceptual model was adopted from the Motivation-Opportunity-Ability (MOA) framework and was extended by adding the serial mediation of consumer perceived knowledge and trust as major constructs. Data were collected from 1788 consumers in China. Results provided support for the model and showed that perceived knowledge about the food supply chain could be both barrier and a positive factor of consumers’ purchase behavior, which mainly depends on the trade-off between certification and planting knowledge. Differences in trust exist and consumers hold authorities and certification bodies more accountable than farmers and retailers. For the direct effects, food safety concern is positively associated with behavior, whereas environmental concern is not.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The movement of manufacturing organisations towards a circular economy sets the scene for extensive industrial change. This change is not simply a continuation of current business; instead, it brings up multiple questions concerning ways of thinking, modes of operation, and the very foundation of a business. Manufacturing organisations are experiencing uncertainty regarding how to address this transformation due to its multi-faceted nature. Maturity models are seen by some as a tool for assessing and guiding manufacturing organisations when it comes to complex and multi-faceted agendas, such as that of the circular economy (CE). Maturity models provide scaffolding in the form of presentation of a desired evolution path from which manufacturing organisations can define reasonable and desirable plans for engagement with the circular economy. This study adopts the cumulative capability perspective in developing a CE maturity reference model that explicates the circular transformation by noting six discrete maturity levels across six organisational dimensions: value creation, governance, people and skills, supply chain and partnership, operations and technology, and product and material. The progression of circular maturity is explained by the principles of expertise and the systems perspective. The explication of CE transformation across dimensions and levels provides a boundary object for organisations, i.e., a scaffolding for moving from its current zone of development to its proximal zone of development.","Uhrenholt J.N., Kristensen J.H., Rincón M.C., Adamsen S., Jensen S.F., Waehrens B.V.",Maturity Model as a Driver for Circular Economy Transformation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132866223&doi=10.3390%2fsu14127483&partnerID=40&md5=9b56d343254b3ea1478414b629d26501
Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"The nature of the performance effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has long been debated, yet gaps in the literature remain. In this study, we demonstrated that does it “pay to be good” in the supply chain. Specifically, we explored whether a firm's CSR activities impact value added in the supply chain. Building on theoretical foundations of the O-ring theory of economic development, we developed a production function describing processes subject to mistakes made by any of several suppliers in production networks and the potential impact CSR could have on value-added creation. Our results provide evidence for a positive significant relationship between value-added in the supply chain and the disclosure of CSR reports, implying that the net effect of CSR disclosure is, on average, value-added enhancing rather than value-added destroying for the supply chain in our sample. Notably, we verified that these results are not only driven by increases in CSR disclosure and related improvements in firm performance but also create spillover effects in the supply chain.

PLoS ONE,"The need for environmental protection and involvement of ecological aspects in the business operations is forcing the organizations to re-examine their action plans and rebuild their supply chain activities. Many organizations are incorporating environmental rules and regulations in their everyday matters by focusing on green supplier selection. The proposed research paper develops a multi-objective interactive fuzzy programming model for the selection of suppliers. This model works on a business quartet of green appraisal score, cost, quality, and time. The model uses an environmental scale for different green parameters and all the suppliers are scored based on this scale. In this research model, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methodology is integrated with the multi-objective interactive fuzzy programming. QFD technique is utilized to compute the weights of several green factors used for the selection of suppliers. The model uses a Fuzzy linguistic scale and a triangular membership function to link expert opinions along with their experience to solve the problem. Finally, the model is validated on a numerical case study of the textile industry for green supplier selection which achieves a 100% satisfaction for cost and time, 75% satisfaction for green appraisal score, and 93.95% for the quality. The proposed model assists the decision-makers in selecting green suppliers to improve the overall sustainability of their organizations.","Khattak B.K., Naseem A., Ullah M., Imran M., Ferik S.E.",Incorporating management opinion in green supplier selection model using quality function deployment and interactive fuzzy programming,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132454681&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0268552&partnerID=40&md5=cb8077300d225ad8e5337f918e7fc88e
Forest Policy and Economics,"The need for further ambitious global action to reverse the trend of tropical deforestation and forest degradation and associated human rights concerns is evident. A range of transnational and European Union (EU) regulatory trade policy instruments and market governance mechanisms have been established to achieve these goals. However, illegal timber and forest-risk agricultural commodities continue to be traded internationally. Both the EU and Brazil are part of the problem but can also offer solutions to mitigate the risks of trading illegal timber and forest-risk agricultural commodities. In this paper, we review the main transnational issues at stake and assess under which conditions EU forest-related trade instruments coupled with domestic actions in Brazil can effectively curb illegal and unsustainable commodity production and associated international trade. Shortcomings in the mechanisms for identifying illegality in production, trade, and consumption are identified and possible solutions suggested. Heated political disputes, insufficient political will for transformative changes to tackle negative socio-environmental externalities associated with global commodity trade, and the still non-effective use of available regulatory policies and market mechanisms contribute to international trade practices still far from achieving desired and internationally recognized legality and sustainability standards. Following the assumption that international governance mechanisms of commodity trade between the EU and Brazil may play a relevant role in stimulating positive shifts, we conclude how the existing and emerging possible policy options can be combined through a mix of policy instruments to ensure legal and sustainable production and trade practices that could effectively support the protection and sustainable management of tropical rainforests.","Sotirov M., Azevedo-Ramos C., Rattis L., Berning L.",Policy options to regulate timber and agricultural supply-chains for legality and sustainability: The case of the EU and Brazil,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137411010&doi=10.1016%2fj.forpol.2022.102818&partnerID=40&md5=152fe2c7aeaa755c4f0e9559b38dbb43
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"The need for Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is felt across “agriculture food supply chain (AFSC)” to tackle the global demand for food items and concerns regarding food safety and security. Further, this transformation is possible due to recent advancements in I4.0 technologies, including “Internet-of-Things (IoT), Blockchain, Big Data (BD), Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Cloud Computing (CC) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS)” etc. Each of these technologies has a specific role in making the AFSC eco-system smart enough to address today's world challenges. Thus, this paper reviews these major technologies in AFSC to understand their applications and recent trends. The review is based on 146 articles from the “Scopus and Web of Science” database. The articles include peer-reviewed journals published between 2010 and 2020. The applications of reviewed technology in AFSC are analysed under five research dimensions, namely traceability and food safety, information system management, food waste, control and monitoring, decision making and agribusiness, and other miscellaneous-based applications. The study suggests that the integration of reviewed technologies can be more useful to provide low-cost solutions and empower sustainability in AFSC. Further, blockchain can emerge as a game-changer to ensure food safety and security.

VDI Berichte,"The need for sustainable development has been recognized by a majority of our society and the challenge to reduce the impacts of our actions regarding climate change, resource consumption and shrinking bio-diversity must be tackled. This is especially true for the agricultural sector and food production, a field so strongly and closely connected to the ecosystem. While historically the main focus in this sector was to maximize productivity in the most effective and efficient way, largely irrespective of ecological costs, there is now an urgent need for a shift towards sustainable systems to support our planet’s future. This shift can be tackled on both an overall systemic level as well as in a detailed design of machinery required in the process. Complex products such as agricultural machines and systems, determine the broad scope of areas for improvement, creating an array of possibilities and challenges. On the one hand, we can see the implementation of new technologies can create a shift in machine process design and architecture. This shift is supported by the implementation of smart systems collecting and analysing data, which when transferred to the machinery provide the optimal response to the real world conditions. Autonomous machines, in particular, as the next step in the course of digitizing production systems allow more flexibility and increased productivity. They also allow us to move from current traditional farming procedures, to optimize the whole farming process from soil preparation through seeding to harvest for larger scale mass production, with the additional benefit of targeting and reducing the negative ecological effects on the base process level. Autonomous machines could also be used in more advanced and complex conditions and are more flexible in application than their predecessors. On the other hand, there are already established sustainability aspects of machine design and production. The use of sustainable energy for agricultural applications could be further developed for agricultural machines, with a potential to create the smart systems efficiently collecting and analysing energy use data to develop improvements. Likewise, the efficiency and types of material used in the production could be improved through changes in the supply chain or during the development process. New proposals can take place during design ideation, for example, by implementing modular solutions in the system, thus positively influencing resource consumption and production costs. Other business aspects such as planned obsolescence, fully closed internal systems and machine ecosystems, limited reparability, already deliver increased profits to the company, but transfer financial costs to the user side and ultimately create a bigger ecological burden and waste through the shorter product lifespan. Last but not least, strongly connected with automation is social sustainability, where we have to consider the impact on the community and future users. With fewer workers in industrial agriculture, new systems should allow people to work in areas, where their skills cannot be replaced, such as providing the supervision and support to the whole system. The paper addresses some areas of sustainability improvements in the agricultural sector, with a special focus on implementing autonomous machines in field applications. In addition, we discuss the relevant requirements and approaches when it comes to sustainable service and machine design in agriculture.","Holovač M., Krzywinski J.",Aspects of sustainability improvement in the design of future agricultural systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134547801&doi=10.51202%2f9783181023952-203&partnerID=40&md5=a44dc7b9dea99fcc83e189b1eb509211

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The new business environment, and the new era of digital transformation put pressure on the global supply chain and accordingly on ports to cope with such changes; these require ports to be smarter and adapt to the new technological approaches. Smart ports SP express the prevailing trend for the transformation strategies. Although many previous studies discuss smart ports requirements there is no integrated vision provided before to capture different comprehensive elements of smart port and show its impact on sustainably. Therefore, this research aims at developing an integrated smart port index SPI, capturing different elements of SP and linking them to port sustainability performance. The research conducted a systematic literature review to identify all pillars that are required for the smart port adaptation and showed its impact on sustainability with a full-text reading stage that resulted in 48 articles. The paper indicated that few studies of the SPI have been proposed before to improve SP activity in different domains: operations, environment, energy, safety, and security; however, there is a need to address the several key issues related to port operations, and to consider human resources factor as part of the smart port requirement, particularly an integrated index that captures different pillars in SP elements and shows its effect on sustainable performance. The study reveals that SP initiatives around the world have different integration levels. According to this, the smart port index can be considered as the first integrated index linked to sustainability and including human resources; however, there are some limitations that could be an open issue to future researchers and practitioners to foster new practical research initiatives that can rely on this index to adapt the smart port practices in different ports, taking into consideration the human resources aspect and testing their impact on port sustainability.","Othman A., El-Gazzar S., Knez M.",A Framework for Adopting a Sustainable Smart Sea Port Index,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128920021&doi=10.3390%2fsu14084551&partnerID=40&md5=16ec22b9dfc29264f03d6a68831bef63
Mathematics,"The number of research papers interested in studying the social dimension of supply chain sustainability and resilience is increasing in the literature. However, the social dimension is complex, with several uncertainty variables that cannot be expressed with a traditional Boolean logic of totally true or false.

We validate our approach using the Chile database for training our model and the Mexico database for testing. The fuzzy knowledge database has a predictive power of more than 80%, using social sustainability features as inputs regarding supply chain resilience in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic disruption.

As the supply chain process requires a significant data handling system among the companies, however, companies are lacking in this area. Therefore, the relationship between data storage, data transformation, data utilization, order management and SCS were examined. Data was collected from the rubber industry. For the purpose of data collection, questionnaires were used, and data were collected from the rubber companies of Indonesia. Results of this study shows that Industry 4.0 has a vital role in SCS. Implementation of Industry 4.0 among the rubber companies shows a positive effect on SCS. Particularly, the applications of big data technology have a vital role in order management and SCS. Big data technology has a significant positive effect on SCS.

"Studies in Systems, Decision and Control","The objective of this chapter is to extend and combine two concepts of Eco-holonic structures and spherical fuzzy sets to introduce a novel concept of spherical fuzzy Eco-holonic structures. Both concepts consider different aspects of sustainability around the systems of real-world cases, so that caused an increase in a comprehensive analysis of the system. Eco-holonic structures help to consider many details of the system together with fuzzy logic, which assists to consider and evaluate the uncertainty around the system. Then, a multi attribute group decision making (MAGDM) method based on the spherical fuzzy Eco-holonic structure is proposed. Supply chain selection of aviation fuels is a hot topic these days and has very complexities. Sustainable supply chain (SSC) selection of aviation fuels is the most significant field of study among all aviation fuel supply chain problems because of many intuitive criteria that have to be considered through the decision-making procedure. Constructing and defining such an intuitive and comprehensive model for the aviation fuel supply chain is still out of sight, even though the significant research that have been done in this field. Another hardness of SSC in the aviation fuel is the satisfaction of all criteria based on such a complicated model. In this chapter, a spherical fuzzy Eco-holonic structure is defined for the sustainable supply chain of aviation fuels problem. Then, the proposed MAGDM method in SF Eco-holonic structure is applied to solve the SSC of aviation fuel problem. To show the feasibility and applicability of the proposed SF eco-holonic structure, it is applied in the aviation fuel SSC problem.","Farid F., Donyatalab Y.",Novel Spherical Fuzzy Eco-holonic Concept in Sustainable Supply Chain of Aviation Fuel,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114875161&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-75067-1_9&partnerID=40&md5=1e23fa63e33ab2b558a9f2d96ba09486

The proposed study constructs a model of the critical success factors using the interpretive structural modelling approach and tests the model using regression analysis technique. Analysis of the results indicates that there are some critical success factors which have high driving power and low dependence that require utmost attention and are of great paramount while other cluster consists of those critical success factors which are highly dependent and need futuristic actions. In this work, only regression analysis technique is used to validate the model that is developed using interpretive structural modelling approach. This type of relegation will help the supply chain managers to distinguish between independent and dependent critical success factors and how the relationships among the critical success factors will efficaciously minimise the risk in a supply chain.

Journal of Sustainability Science and Management,"The objective of this study is to identify barriers in participating in the collection of traceable catch landing data for shark and ray species among small-scale fishers in Pahang, Malaysia. As one of the major shark catchers in the world, Malaysia has been recommended to implement a traceability system to manage its supply chain process, starting from catch landings, to ensure sustainable fishing of sharks and rays. The participation of of small-scale fishers in this effort is crucial due to the significant impact of shark and ray population to their livelihood, even though they have limited capability to record catch data due to lack of resources and education. A purposive snowball sampling was used to identify participants for focus group discussions (FGD). A semi-structured open-ended proforma was used as a discussion guide. The findings suggest that there are five barriers to participation, namely (i) shark and ray resources; (ii) governance and management support; (iii) infrastructure and management information system; (iv) fishers' commitment and buy-ins; and, (v) collaboration effort among stakeholders. It is important for policymakers to consider mandatory registration of shark and ray fishers, besides encouraging them to report their catch up to species level with incentives and training programs, as well as information technology improvements, to overcome the barriers.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"The occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic is a disruption that has adversely affected many supply chains (SCs) around the world and further proved the necessity of combination and interaction of resilience and sustainability. In This paper, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for responsive, resilient and sustainable mixed open and closed-loop supply chain network design (SCND) problem. The uncertainty of the problem is handled with a hybrid robust-stochastic optimization approach. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR) method and a constructive heuristic (CH) algorithm are developed for overcoming problem complexity and solving large-scale instances. In order to assess the performance of the mathematical model and solution methods, some test instances are generated. The computations showed that the model and the solution methods are efficient and can obtain high-quality solutions in suitable CPU times. Other analyses and computations are done based on a real case study in the tire industry. The results demonstrate that resilient strategies are so effective and can improve economic, environmental and social dimensions substantially. Research findings suggest that the proposed model can be used as an efficient tool for designing sustainable and resilient SCs and the related decision-makings. Also, our findings prove that resilience is necessary for continued SC sustainability. It is concluded that using proposed resilience strategies simultaneously brings the best outcome for SC objectives. Based on the sensitivity analyses, the responsiveness level significantly affects SC objectives, and managers should consider the trade-off between responsiveness and their objectives.","Vali-Siar M.M., Roghanian E.","Sustainable, resilient and responsive mixed supply chain network design under hybrid uncertainty with considering COVID-19 pandemic disruption",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121614591&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2021.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=fc252ff8e4d5c46f201081f6adf3a4be
Business Strategy and the Environment,"The operationalization of sustainable development involves ambiguity, complexity and uncertainty. It becomes more complex when applied in supply chain operations. Indeed, the research in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) is influenced by positivist paradigms that do not address subjective issues. Therefore, we suggest that SSCM is often dealing with so-called ‘wicked’ problems. This paper aims to emphasize the relationship between wicked problem complexities and SSCM characteristics. Through a ground theory approach, we develop a conceptual framework that relates the social, cognitive and temporal complexities of a wicked problem with characteristics of SSCM. Furthermore, we propose business strategies to mediate this relationship.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The optimization of a product’s whole life cycle has become a mandatory task for manufacturers seeking to deal with circular economy requirements while gaining competitiveness in the market. In order to achieve such a sustainability goal, alignment of production, distribution, and field service activities is needed. In the literature, numerous studies indicate the product–service system (PSS) approach as one of the most promising business models to combine the needs of manufacturers and customers in an efficient and effective manner. However, PSS solutions aimed at practically optimizing supply chain management have scarcely been addressed. In order to reduce this gap, the current study proposes a procedure based on the PSS Functional Matrix, the Screening Life Cycle Modelling (SLCM) method, and stock management theory to optimize aftermarket services based on market demand. A case study in the medical equipment sector, where market demand can fluctuate during the contract period, is presented. The analytical results show beneficial effects in terms of both costs and environmental impact, suggesting the need for further research to augment knowledge on PSS and supply chain management.

WSEAS Transactions on Business and Economics,"The paper shows the state of the art of identification, formation and development of the clusters in Colombia, collecting topics from the decentralization process in Colombia, the fiscal decentralization and the economic growth; a period of economic changes in the country begins from these two topics, the productive apparatus is prepared to compete with the most demanding markets of Europe, Asia and North America. For carrying out this, it was necessary to change the culture of production, it is not a matter of doing what the entrepreneur wants but to propose new goods and services to the global market, generating a brand value and differentiating them from international competitors; Colombia in the twentieth century opened its doors to foreign trade, and started working on the proposal of economic opening, it was necessary to work on the new Political Constitution of Colombia, from that time there is a change, a work of the National Planning Department, in conjunction with the National Council for Competitiveness, the work is based on proposing new productive bets, this as a strategy to face the competition that was seen coming to the country, with the risk of losing national entries in the market by national companies and on the contrary the international companies would arrive at the national market with new products, innovated and of low price, the national industry would not be able to produce and compete at the prices of the imported goods. One of the initiatives is to form associativity, by means of which productive processes could be improved, more advanced technology would be handled, joint research would be carried out, and work would be done to transfer knowledge, strengthen the productive chain and within the organizations would improve the value chain as a strategic tool, through which the company's activities and sources of competitive advantage are analyzed; from this, the clusters are being worked on another proposal, which began to revolutionize Colombia's economic change by moving from an economy based on extractive and mining activity to offering differentiated products with added value, quality was considered an integral part of the good and with a specialized human resource, in this way the regions have made a great social leap, since from this new chain the regions begin to strengthen their economy, to improve their human talent, to manage the supply chain, and above all to export nonmining energy products that in short only leave shortages of products from the family basket, depletes and impoverishes the productivity of their soils, contributing a negative GDP, because in the long time, the land where the mineral exploitation as oil and coal become sterile for that, although at one point they can represent an important sector for the economic activity of the country and reflects in its GDP an important percentage to the economy, this type of economic activity destroys the country's competitiveness in the long term, so in the medium term can be seen as a lever for economic and social development. The clusters represent a new production alternative for the country as a strategy for local growth, for the Colombian economy in global scenarios means diversification in the exportable supply; for this, it is necessary to define strategies that enable productive transformation in the country, this will provide tools and sophisticated knowledge allowing the productive sector to obtain greater profitability and sustainability over time, to offer products, bines and high quality services [28]. The aim that the cluster network has been working for is the generation and exchange of knowledge among the different actors that are part of the productive alliance formation and cluster dynamization.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"The partnership supply of market needs is one of the most regarded orientations in recent years. In this paper, a competitive model is designed in partnership supply networks including parent firms (brands), manufacturing plants, governmental logistics company and franchised stores. In the raised scheme, the involved supply networks seek to develop their upstream and downstream partnerships (respectively with manufacturing plants and franchised stores) in a competitive environment. Besides this cross-network competition, the downstream partners of each network develop some virtual alliances. In such alliances, each of the involved members, further pursuing its own interests, aims to increase the overall share of the parent brand. Even more striking, a multi-agent transportation platform is implemented in the distribution of products to meet the environmental sustainability requirements. The state-owned logistics company, as the market leader of the cited distributed structure, dictates its strategy to the supply networks seeking to gain the most possible partnership interactions. Hence, in this paper, a multi-level competition-oriented problem is considered in the partnership supply networks and formulated upon multiple hierarchical stages. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem and given its structural features, a matheuristic approach based on a combination of the Benders Decomposition method and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is developed. The proposed solving approach is compared against a gaming-based heuristic and also a pure Benders Decomposition.

Applied Mathematical Modelling,"The planting and harvesting of medicinal plants have characteristics that differentiate them from other crop types and complicate their planning. For example, drug processors do not require large quantities of product to be harvested but have a high concentration of active molecules. There is no evidence for any optimization tool to support the planting and harvesting of such plants. Given this sector's importance and its impact on populations’ health, it is necessary to develop solutions to increase the sustainability of their supply chains. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a conceptual framework to characterize a crop planting and harvesting planning problem, and a multi-objective optimization model for the planning of planting, harvesting, post-harvesting, distribution and storage of medicinal plants with variable concentrations of molecules and minimum time between harvests. The model optimizes three objectives aligned with sustainability: supply chain costs, concentration of molecules in plants, farmers’ perceived economic unfairness. It is validated by its application to a case study of medicinal plants in the Basilicata region (Italy). The ε-constraint method is used to obtain 11 non dominated solutions showing the possibility of eliminating farmers’ perception of economic unfairness by maintaining similar values for supply chain costs and concentrations of active molecules when planning the production of medicinal plants. Finally, the TOPSIS method is applied to select the best plan to be implemented into the supply chain.","Esteso A., Alemany M.M.E., Ortiz Á., Iannacone R.",Crop planting and harvesting planning: Conceptual framework and sustainable multi‐objective optimization for plants with variable molecule concentrations and minimum time between harvests,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135964158&doi=10.1016%2fj.apm.2022.07.023&partnerID=40&md5=36c4bb8c36351c8e699ab9ac0ad4f059
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"The present agriculture food supply chain (AFSC) faces numerous challenges about the growing demand for food items and consumer preference regarding food safety. In addition to growing concerns about sustainability, stringent government regulation, food security, and traceability issues force the managers, industries, and practitioners working in AFSC to adopt new tools, techniques, and methodology to model current food supply chain issues and correspondingly design the food logistics network. To this effect, the purpose of this article is threefold: the first focus is to identify the various challenges in AFSC, second is to review the research contribution in the field of designing agro-food supply chain network (AFSCN), while the third aspect is to investigate performance measurement system of AFSC through various performance indicators. For this, 108 articles are reviewed, and the main research findings are discussed in different aspects. Technology adoption and integration in design AFSCN are exciting prospects for future AFSC research. In addition, the digital transformation of AFSC is gaining wide acceptance across all agro-stakeholders and practitioners. Similarly, other research trends are further emphasized, and possible future challenges are also identified.","Yadav V.S., Singh A.R., Gunasekaran A., Raut R.D., Narkhede B.E.","A systematic literature review of the agro-food supply chain: Challenges, network design, and performance measurement perspectives",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120347441&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2021.11.019&partnerID=40&md5=191ca22049fa8572624d030a738c1e6e
Business Strategy and the Environment,"The present article analyzes the use of enterprise resources planning (ERP) packages to be part of the solution for the main issues related to the blockchain. ERP modules have been listed and tested against seven propositions, to check the ability to better use ERP for solving blockchain concerns. The research is based on the previous study of Saberi et al. (2019; 10.1080/00207543.2018.1533261) about the relationship between sustainable supply chain management and blockchain. We use structural equation modeling (SEM) to check the validity of the propositions. Based on the results, we propose recommendations for companies to sustainably improve their supply chain strategy with the use of blockchain, along with ERP modules. The results show that the selected companies would benefit from ERP and blockchain technology integration, as they both improve their sustainable corporate performance and integrate them more successfully in the supply chain. ERP and blockchain are to be used together to approach today's challenges and better prepare companies for the uncertain future.","Sislian L., Jaegler A.",Linkage of blockchain to enterprise resource planning systems for improving sustainable performance,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117070236&doi=10.1002%2fbse.2914&partnerID=40&md5=4eb5eb2f4a2ace9b1e49eed366e1bde1
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"The present article introduces the SPOTTER approach, a novel way to assess supply disruption impacts along the supply chain in the short-term (i.e. the next 5 years) and the medium-term (i.e. in 5 to 15 years) within the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment framework. This approach allows finding the more important supply risks within global supply chains and over different time horizons, which leads to fine-tuned insights that can help creating resilient supply networks. To this end, the SPOTTER approach assesses overall supply disruption impacts for complete supply chains and supply disruption hotspots separately in the short- and medium-term. The overall impacts and hotspots are evaluated from global and country-specific supply disruption events and aggregated into the two categories of 'cost variability' and 'limited availability'. Scores of these impacts and hotspots are calculated by multiplying resource, material and product flows with respective characterization factors, which are case-specific and are defined by diverse indicators of supply disruption probability and vulnerability. The article provides an overview of the SPOTTER approach and its rationale by explaining the selection and use of indicators to define characterization factors and by describing the procedure to calculate the overall impact and hotspot scores. Furthermore, it presents an implementation procedure for the practical application of the approach. Finally, it highlights the data availability and methodological issues that currently affect the implementation practicability and the representativeness of the SPOTTER approach to describe global supply risks in detail and refers to the need for future research and development on this topic.","Berr M., Beloin-Saint-Pierre D., Hischier R., Hool A., Wäger P.",SPOTTER: Assessing supply disruption impacts along the supply chain within Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135498086&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2022.100063&partnerID=40&md5=ad7595286ac4bef80a429c3ee3752e40

The results indicated the sustainability and resilience of SC are hot topics. Therefore, the need for qualitative and longitudinal studies and the use of methods such as ethnography or historical analysis are understood well in this respect. The current study had a holistic approach to SC, and thus simultaneously covered the relevant areas and provided an appropriate strategy for identifying the missing circles in the SC field using the meta-study and scientometric instruments.

Processes,"The present study focuses on supply chain management to improve its sustainability from economic, environmental, and social perspectives. First, improving production process reliability and cost reduction are two main factors for enhancing economic sustainability. Hence, we introduced autonomated inspection and invested in ordering and setup costs. Second, reducing the carbon footprint in supply chains is the main pillar of their environmental stewardship, which is addressed by an eco-friendly and flexible production system in this study. Finally, an advanced single-setup-multi-delivery (SSMD) strategy is utilized to improve social aspects associated with human labor increase. For practicality, demand is considered as the selling price and is quality dependent. The sustainability enhancement is transformed as a term of profit; therefore, our model maximizes the total profit of the supply chain by optimizing a manufacturer’s and retailer’s decision variables. Numerical examples show that autonomation technology increases the system’s reliability by (Formula presented.), where eco-production reduces carbon emission by up to (Formula presented.), and the total profit increases by up to (Formula presented.).

Environmental Footprints and Eco-Design of Products and Processes,"The principal aim of this chapter is to determine the trajectory of the future development of sustainable agriculture. This chapter will undertake a systematic evaluation of the sustainability of circular agriculture by analyzing its contribution to stability, food security, circularity, expanded reproduction, environmental and energy efficiency. The criterion of assessing food security will depend on the availability and affordability of food, neutrality and sustainability of agriculture, and quality and security of food. The critical review presented by the authors epitomizes the circular practices of agriculture in terms of its merits and demerits. The research was arrived at following the Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs) by determining the impact of circular agriculture on their achievement based on international experience. The authors authenticated the merits of demonstration of corporate social and ecological responsibility at agriculture companies that implement circular practices for the sustainable development of agriculture. The following components of the dataset are used: combat against climate variation, corporate social responsibility, and sustainable development. The current economic model was severely affected over the last decade due to unsustainability (Esposito et al. in A systematic literature review. Sustainability 12:7401, 2020 [3]). This economic model was characterized by numerous challenges in the agro-food sector (AFS), resulting in scarcity of resources, decreased food production, and waste generation along the supply chain (Esposito et al. in A systematic literature review. Sustainability 12:7401, 2020 [3]). The authors concluded that there is an imperative need for a paradigm shift toward circular agriculture due to rapid climatic change and biodiversity loss.","Matkerimova A.M., Kadyrov T.A., Torogeldieva A.B., Ogoreva Y.A.",Systematic Assessment of the Sustainability of Circular Agriculture,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131806931&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-1125-5_23&partnerID=40&md5=cd467e21762e5222cec6f44349d1248c
Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering,"The problem of social responsibility and sustainable development in the logistics business does not have sufficiently broad coverage in public reports of companies, in scientific research, and market surveys. Especially it applies to business in the Russian Federation, where the market of 4PL services, fulfillment e-business is at the stage of emerging, and the market of last-mile logistics services is at the stage of active growth. Without achieving business sustainability, entrepreneurs have mostly failed to reach the conscious strategic management of their business. However, today it is exactly the logistics sphere where the issues of the feasibility of innovations, rational use of resources, and environmental protection arise sharply. The policy of corporate social responsibility in logistical subsystems has a clearly defined functional approach and is implemented mainly by transnational companies, large logistics operators. The development of the logistics sphere is tightly connected with the trends of Industry 4.0 and requires the managers to realize the strategic priority of business sustainability. The purpose of the study is to identify the nature of responsible and sustainable logistics in today's economy, search for opportunities for its growth and determine the conditions for effective implementation of CSR principles in supply chain management.

Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"The production and consumption of products are held responsible for most environmental challenges and climatic changes, which adversely affect human lives and compromise the future of generations to come. Sustainable production appears as a strategic route to combat these adversities, the pursuit of which is highly challenging. In this study, we argue that Intellectual capital (IC), featured by human capital, relational capital, and structural capital, can play a dual role in improving the sustainable production of a firm. We put forward that IC contributes to sustainable production directly and indirectly through the adoption of blockchain-driven supply chain management (BCSCM). In this context, the objective of this study is to examine the impact of intellectual capital (IC) on sustainable production. The study also investigates the role of SC mapping and BCSCM in the association between IC and sustainable production. Data were collected from 289 textile firms of Pakistan and Bangladesh with the help of a designed questionnaire. The study employed CB-SEM to examine the modeled relationship. Further, PLS-Multi-group Analysis (MGA) was used for cross-country comparison of the results. The results diverge from the conventional wisdom exhibiting an insignificant direct impact of IC in sustainable production. Nevertheless, the results show a meaningful indirect effect of IC through BCSCM and SC mapping on sustainable production. Results also exhibit a significant direct impact of BCSCM on the sustainable production of a firm. The results call for consideration of IC and BCSCM in improving the sustainability of a firm.","Kusi-Sarpong S., Mubarik M.S., Khan S.A., Brown S., Mubarak M.F.","Intellectual capital, blockchain-driven supply chain and sustainable production: Role of supply chain mapping",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118741792&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2021.121331&partnerID=40&md5=454bf8f372981e21dd44f3bee3b94079
Biofuels and Biorefining: Volume 1: Current Technologies for Biomass Conversion,"The production of biojet fuel from renewable feedstocks such as biomass represents an important goal for the aviation sector and a key strategy in its stated global vision to reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the extensive use of conventional jet fuel. According to the International Air Transport Association, the aviation sector accounts for 2% of all global carbon dioxide emissions. This is equivalent to 705 million tonnes of CO2, a volume that is expected to rise by 340% to 3.1 billion tonnes by 2050. In this regard, there is extensive public and private sector research and development initiatives to explore and develop economically efficient and environmentally sustainable conversion technologies for the production of biojet fuel as a substitute for petroleum-based fuels. This chapter provides a detailed discussion of current and emerging biojet fuel conversion technologies, along with their techno-economic feasibility, supply chain integration, commercial implementation, and environmental sustainability. A number of technologies are described based on their associated feedstock platforms. In particular, four primary conversion pathways are considered: oil-to-jet, sugar-to-jet, gas-to-jet, and alcohol-to-jet. The chapter presents an integrative biorefinery approach which considers each technology in terms of the array of steps spanning feedstock supply, technology scale-up, commercialization, and least-cost conversion into intermediate and final products, while meeting requirements for environmental sustainability.","Mupondwa E., Li X., Tabil L.","Production of biojet fuel: Conversion technologies, technoeconomics, and commercial implementation",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137583766&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-12-824116-5.00005-2&partnerID=40&md5=23e4dc80cb5d513845b751fdebf47327
Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,"The production of dairy products is related to water and energy costs and generation of large amounts of emissions of pollutants. Full sustainability of these systems can be achieved by optimizing all activities in the supply chain (SC) taking into account not only the environmental and economic aspects, but also the social ones. This study proposes a multi-objective modeling approach for optimal design of three-echelon SC for production of dairy products according to different recipes while satisfying environmental, economic and social criteria defined in terms of costs. The environmental costs are associated with the generated wastewater from dairy production and CO2 emissions due to energy consumed and transport of raw materials and products. The social ones are related to the employees hired for implementation of the SC activities. It was implemented on a real case study from Bulgaria. Four mix integer nonlinear programming optimization models were defined–one without and three with social impact consideration. They were solved at different values of the environmental and social constraints. The obtain results showed that stricter environmental constraints lead to higher economic costs and lower profit. Conversely, higher environmental constraints result in higher profit and lower economic costs. The greatest share in the environmental impact has the wastewater generated, followed by CO2 emissions related with energy consumed and CO2 emissions due to transport. The obtained solutions can be used in the decision-making process in terms of seeking a trade-off between profit, environmental and social impact.

Lecture Notes in Logistics,"The production of raw materials has become a backbone of the manufacturing industries and will play a relevant role in the transition process to global sustainability by 2050. Due to its nature, the mining industry (MI) is highly prone to disruptions, by triggering a shortage of mineral raw materials or commodities in the downstream segment of many supply chains (SC).

However, there is no common understanding on the concept of SCRes in the mining industry context in literature. This paper aims to contribute to a conceptualization of SCRes in the mining industry by defining and operationalizing main resilience principles and elements from the mineral SC topics and by taking into account the industrial nature of the MI.

AIMS Environmental Science,"The proposed study described the application of innovative technology to solve the issues in a supply chain model due to the players’ unreliability. The unreliable manufacturer delivers a percentage of the ordered quantity to the retailer, which causes shortages. At the same time, the retailer provides wrong information regarding the amount of the sales of the product. Besides intelligent technology, a single setup multiple unequal increasing delivery transportation policy is applied in this study to reduce the holding cost of the retailer. A consumed fuel and electricity-dependent carbon emission cost are used for environmental sustainability. Since the industries face problems with smooth functioning in each of its steps for unreliable players, the study is proposed to solve the unpredictable player problem in the supply chain. The robust distribution approach is utilized to overcome the situation of unknown lead time demand. Two metaheuristic optimization techniques, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used to optimize the total cost. From the numerical section, it is clear the PSO is 0.32 % more beneficial than GA to obtain the minimum total cost of the supply chain. The discussed case studies show that the applied single-setup-multi-unequal-increasing delivery policy is 0.62 % beneficial compared to the single-setup-single-delivery policy and 0.35 % beneficial compared to the single-setup-multi-delivery policy.

A Stackelberg differential game is modeled, and the equilibrium pricing and emission reduction solutions are compared between integrated and decentralized channel settings. A two-part tariff contract is further proposed to improve channel performance. The numerical analysis illustrates that the emission reduction level, green reputation, demand, and entire profit of the supply chain are larger in the integrated setting than the counterparts in the decentralized setting. However, the relationship between the two channels in terms of retail price depends on unit carbon tax. In addition, the two-part tariff contract can perfectly achieve channel coordination. Results also indicate that firms can benefit from increasing the effect of green reputation on demand.","Wang J., Zhang Q., Lu X., Ma R., Yu B., Gao H.",Emission reduction and coordination of a dynamic supply chain with green reputation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118347770&doi=10.1007%2fs12351-021-00678-7&partnerID=40&md5=46385bceff868825899cdab9ebcb51f3
International Journal of Operational Research,"The purpose of the study is to develop a network model for effective decision making from the sustainability aspect. The study proposes a mathematical programming model to optimise an environmentally constructed supply chain. The effect on the environment by components such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic particles formed during transportation in the supply chain has been considered. The multi-objective genetic algorithm optimises total cost and total environmental impact, which were subjected to constraints of demand, return, flow balance and capacity. The total cost consists of purchase cost, fixed cost, transportation cost, manufacturing cost, processing cost and inventory cost. Environmental impact of production, transportation, handling, lead reclamation, and plastic recycling process was considered. The model also uses life cycle assessment-based method for quantification of environmental impact and establishes Pareto optimal solutions for minimisation of economic as well as environmental impact. Results show a considerable reduction in closed-loop supply chain cost.","Dhage S.S., Narwane V.S., Raut R.D., Dere N.K., Gardas B.B., Narkhede B.E.",Mathematical programming model to optimise an environmentally constructed supply chain: a genetic algorithm approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133163004&doi=10.1504%2fIJOR.2022.123397&partnerID=40&md5=141ff4ca213bc93850a22f7f6d62c66c
International Journal of Food Studies,"The purpose of the study was to identify the motivations and the barriers that stakeholders face regarding Short Food Supply Chains (SFSC). Two focus groups with stakeholders of the agricultural sector and SFSC were conducted in the Netherlands and Switzerland. A first fundamental topic addressed by participants was the one related to the definition of SFSC, which is far from consensual, \short"" being often associated and sometimes confused with local, direct, small, fair, ecological, fresh, healthy, etc. However, a series of positive and negative factors in uencing SFSC development, and the involvement of agri-food stakeholders were identified. On the one hand, the unique relationship built through direct contact between producers and consumers, the fair distribution of value added in the chain that producers can find in engaging in SFSC, the increasing number of SFSC initiatives, the farm resilience, and territorial strategies that are being developed seem to be the most positive aspects, that can explain the trends moving towards these types of distribution channel. On the other hand, many hindering factors were also identified, such as weak communication and marketing capacity of producers, and a lack of efficiency and cooperation between peers. The fierce competition of conventional distribution, using green washing, together with a profusion of labels, price issues, and unsuitable standards were mentioned as the main threats faced by SFSC actors.","Aouinait C., Christen D., Carlen C., Mehauden L., Mora P., Massar B., Frederiks M.",Motivations and Barriers for Engagement in Short Food Supply Chains: Insights from European Focus Groups,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135397903&doi=10.7455%2fijfs%2f11.SI.2022.a8&partnerID=40&md5=ceac1590ab21490d01086fc33b61f4a6
Operations Research Perspectives,"The purpose of this article is twofold: to identify the critical risk factors (RFs) that impact supply chains (SC) in the engineering, procurement, and construction of large-scale projects (EPC-LSP) of the oil and gas industry (OGI) and to apply these RFs in a mathematical model developed, based on multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods in an expert group. The mathematical model was developed in MATLAB and was based on the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMÉTHÉE) II and (PROMÉTHÉE GDSS) Group Decision Support System methods. The model's criteria were defined with the RF mapping identified using 33 years of literature and the application of questionnaires to specialists. The evaluation process of the alternatives concerning the defined criteria was conducted through questionnaires to specialists. Finally, the functionality and results of the model were validated by the specialists in the field through interviews. As a contribution, managers, companies, and industry could adopt this solution as a practical and dynamic tool to support decision-making. This fact especially holds true in possible critical supply scenarios, where it is necessary to direct resources to minimize risks and other impacts to EPC-LSP SC. Another novelty refers to the critical risk factors identified, originating from an extensive literature mapping covering the three pillars of sustainability. Moreover, this research was to fill the literature gap, given the lack of studies that propose clear, practical, and specific tools for SCRM in EPC-LSP.","da Cunha R.A., Rangel L.A.D., Rudolf C.A., Santos L.D.",A decision support approach employing the PROMETHEE method and risk factors for critical supply assessment in large-scale projects,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129990012&doi=10.1016%2fj.orp.2022.100238&partnerID=40&md5=4fdbb4226fb184c23aa2701ab0c8ec75

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The purpose of this paper is to develop a measurement instrument for sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) critical factors, practices and performance and validate it in the food industry. A literature review was conducted in order to identify pertinent variables and propose relevant measuring items. An email survey was carried out in 423 Greek companies in the food and beverage sector. The questionnaire was sent by e-mail in the Google Forms format and it was requested to be answered by a representative of the company. The collected data was processed using exploratory factor analysis in order to extract the latent constructs of the SSCM critical factors, practices and performance measures. The validity of the proposed instrument was confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis. The extracted SSCM critical factors are “firm-level sustainability critical factors” and “supply chain sustainability critical factors”. The extracted SSCM practices are “supply chain collaboration” and “supply chain strategic orientation”. The extracted SSCM performance factors are “economic performance”, “social performance” and “environmental performance”. The three developed constructs constitute a measurement instrument that can be used both by practitioners who desire to implement SSCM and by researchers who can apply the proposed scales in other research projects or use them as assessment tools.","Mastos T., Gkotzamani K., Kafetzopoulos D.",Development and Validation of a Measurement Instrument for Sustainability in Food Supply Chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129086109&doi=10.3390%2fsu14095203&partnerID=40&md5=7b1d623b7ac1312a57bf55e212c40984
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"The purpose of this paper is to provide rich empirical evidence on circularity solutions adopted by the largest companies in the fast fashion industry. The sustainability reports of six global players were analyzed using a comprehensive circular model of the value chain. This model comprises eleven stages: product design, virgin raw material extraction and processing, textile and material production, manufacturing, auditing and certification, packaging and retail, customer use, post-consumer garment collection, recycling fibers and materials, partnerships, and transparency. The results are reported on five implementation phases: strategies, research and development, implementation at scale, quantitative indicators, and targets. The analysis shows that major players in this sector created a complex system for reducing their environmental impact while imposing strict rules in their upstream supply chain. Downstream, these companies educate their customers on the topic of circularity and promote recycle-or-reuse consumer habits. In addition to offering practical examples of strategy, product, and process design, the present contribution describes several configurations of circular models as implemented by large fashion retailers. The results have significant implications for theory, management, and standard-setting, considering that fast fashion is widely viewed as having a negative impact on the environment.","Dragomir V.D., Dumitru M.",Practical solutions for circular business models in the fashion industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128251486&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2022.100040&partnerID=40&md5=1b4c6cc5d606ead19131892ea9261c3f
Journal of Global Fashion Marketing,"The purpose of this qualitative study is to evaluate and compare eight sustainability supplier scorecard assessment tools in use among five major international apparel retailers, Walmart, Eileen Fisher, Nike, H&M, and Gap. Inductive content analysis was used to study the raw textual data and make evidence-based inferences. Results showed that the field of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) is subject to inefficiencies because there are inadequate standards for reporting information which would expose these inefficiencies. The investigated tools varied in terms of scope, performance measurements, and scoring methodologies, which had negative effects on their comparability. This obstacle, however, does not invalidate the major findings, which revealed an evident and concerning lack of information to support the practical application of the tools investigated. Because no retailer disclosed information about its lower tier suppliers’ assessments, it is uncertain whether and how suppliers in lower tiers are engaged in sustainability assessments. Because sustainability violations occur at a higher rate within fragmented supply chains, it is critical to communicate supplier engagement throughout the value chain.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,The purpose of this research is to determine how sharing sustainability information about last-mile delivery options affects consumer behaviors. Experiments are conducted in a simulated online shopping environment. Consumers are asked to choose either an expedited shipment or a no-rush home delivery. Results show that typical consumer preferences for faster shipments can be significantly altered by disclosing emissions information and environmental impacts of last-mile delivery options. Consumers will often alter their consumption choice in favor of the lower emissions option. The observed effects are robust with a similar impact on altering consumption as traditional price discounts. These findings suggest retailers can simultaneously reduce distribution costs and carbon emissions without significant operational changes or financial investments by simply educating consumers to reduce the environmental impact of their last-mile delivery choices.,"Thomas R.W., Ueltschy Murfield M.L., Ellram L.M.",Leveraging sustainable supply chain information to alter last-mile delivery consumption: A social exchange perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139027591&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.09.014&partnerID=40&md5=51e359fb9d840eec2212f7f1788bd11e
"Environment, Development and Sustainability","The purpose of this study is to develop a bilevel problem for interdiction and protection of circular supply chain network (BPIPCSCN) for an Indian manufacturing organization. This work used a bilevel mixed-integer quadratic programming approach for the analysis of interdiction and fortification operations in circular production systems and the corresponding economic and environmental conditions. A Stackelberg leadership model between a network planner (defender) and an interdictor (attacker) is studied for evaluating the economic and environmental benefits. The defender selects which of the suppliers, repair and collection centers and sales and distribution centers to protect simultaneously, for maximizing monetary benefit and minimizing environmental impact. Furthermore, the attacker chooses which of them to interdict and disturb the operation of a circular supply chain network such that the monetary benefit is minimized and environmental impact is maximized. This work shows the performance of a circular economy structure in supply chain sustainability in the presence of interdiction and protection operations. The dataset gathered from the case organization is applied. The CPLEX Optimizer solver for MATLAB is executed to simulate the new mathematical model. Due to non-deterministic polynomial time (NP)-hardness of the BPIPCSCN, a powerful tabu search was developed to solve the new problem. A real-world case study of circular supply chain network for an Indian manufacturing organization is considered to declare the application of the novel mathematical problem and the validity of the proposed method. The model is able to calculate the economic profit and environmental impacts obtained through circular operations with respect to the defender's decisions and attacks on suppliers, repair and collection centers and sales and distribution centers. The flow of various levels through the network is also achieved. The proposed tabu search and two comparative metaheuristic algorithms are tested on 36 instances. The computational results demonstrate that the new strategy of tabu search really improves the solution quality, and it is a competitive approach to the considered problem.",Khanduzi R.,Developing a Stackelberg security game for circular supply chain network,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132755702&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-022-02496-z&partnerID=40&md5=006624084c761cbcdcf4149f6a506123

The benefits include ‘Eco-friendly’, ‘Stimulate participation’, ‘Social inclusion’, ‘Transparent recycling chains’ and ‘Extended producer responsibility accountability’. However, the majority of existing BCT-based initiatives are in the pilot stage and face cognitive, technology, internal and external barriers.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The purpose of this study is to investigate and discuss the challenges namely, the barriers and solutions to developing return supply chain policies in automotive industry. This industry has been suffering governmental pressure to achieve sustainability in all industrial processes. The solution is to reorganize the supply chain and rethink the product from the beginning (closed-loop supply chain evolving to cradle-to-cradle supply chain); however, the literature about this process is scarce. This paper presents exploratory research into the automotive supply chain in order to study the processes developed to achieve more sustainable supply chains. A strategic business net is used as theoretical sample to collect data. The results show that climate change concerns and governmental guidelines lead to sustainable organizational culture. It was found that sustainability is integrated in all processes, which affects business interaction with partners. The business interaction is difficulted by total product recycling. To overcome this barrier, innovation strategies, strategic alli-ances and governmental politics are presented as enhancers to return supply chain policies devel-opment. Organizational and cultural elements were presented as difficulties, but could be easily mitigated with the enhancers, alongside commitment and proactivity of companies. The research shows that when the challenges are overcome, the companies can integrate cradle-to-cradle design frameworks into their supply chains.

International Journal of Intelligent Systems,"The purpose of this study is to offer requisite models for unravelling the complex issues that arise in a supplier selection-order allocation problem by soothing the risk and disturbances. To do this, a new uncertain environment, interval type-2 Pythagorean fuzzy set (IT2PFS) is introduced to assist the experts for assuring secure and reliable outcomes in hesitant situations. The operational laws on IT2PFS under Dombi (Formula presented.) -norm and (Formula presented.) -conorm are defined, which are further utilized to develop geometric Bonferroni mean and Bonferroni mean operators based on Choquet integral (CI) under IT2PFS. The aggregation operators can ennoble the pliability of the information blending process through the adjustment of several parameters and can make good interactions among the criteria with their weights. Thereafter, to determine the weights of the criteria, an empirical method, namely the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is amplified by conjoining CI and IT2PFS into it. A multicriteria decision making method, namely, the multiattribute border approximation area comparison (MABAC) and subsequently the CI based grey relational analysis method are then employed to classify the suppliers and derive their corresponding weights with reference to the sustainable criteria. Over and above, a new multiobjective optimization model is exhibited to uphold the purchasing managers for assembling suppliers keeping in mind the sustainability aspects and overall risk of suppliers by following Markowitz portfolio theory. A real-life supply chain management problem is demonstrated to elucidate the aptness and efficiency of the proposed work.

Environmental Impact Assessment Review,"The purpose of this study was to conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the environmental impact of highly concentrated tomato paste produced by cold break and hot break methods. We considered the environmental impact and environmental hot spots related to tomato cultivation, tomato paste processing, packaging, and transportation, and then identified potential improvements for each stage. The research site was in Xinjiang, China, which is the main production area of high-concentration tomato paste for export in China. Taking 240 kg tomato paste packed in 220-L steel drums as the functional unit, the main data were obtained from studies on production enterprises and agricultural statistics. Ten environmental impacts were calculated using eFootprint: primary energy demand (PED), resource depletion-water (WU), climate change (GWP), ozone depletion (ODP), acidification (AP), particulate matter (RI), photochemical ozone formation (POFP), eutrophication (EP), ecotoxicity-freshwater (ET), and human toxicity-cancer effects (HT-cancer); their respective values for cold break paste were 5947 MJ, 82400 kg, 490 kg CO2 eq, 4.07E-06 kg CFC-11 eq, 5.150 kg SO2 eq, 1.600 kg PM2.5 eq, 0.270 kg NMVOC eq, 1.000 kg PO43− eq, 4.230 CTUe, and 3.70E-07 CTUh. The results showed that the environmental impact of cold break paste was lower than that of hot break paste because of lower steam consumption. The cultivation phase was the main contributor to WU, AP, EP, ET, and HT-cancer. In the processing phase, mashed tomatoes are concentrated using a large amount of steam to obtain a concentrated paste product. The energy consumption in the processing phase contributed &gt;50% of PED, GWP, and RI. Although the packaging and transportation phases had smaller environmental impacts, the use of steel drums for packaging cannot be ignored. We conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the overall benefits that could be achieved by different mitigation schemes. In the whole supply chain, improving irrigation and fertilization methods and replacing the primary energy for steam production are the best strategies to improve environmental sustainability.","Ding J., Li Y., Liu J., Qi G., Liu Q., Dong L.","Life cycle assessment of environmental impacts of cold and hot break tomato paste packaged in steel drums and exported from Xinjiang, China",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139362100&doi=10.1016%2fj.eiar.2022.106939&partnerID=40&md5=7729107a780056c78c3b0e609a7b1d77
Frontiers in Psychology,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the moderating role of “organizational citizenship behavior toward the environment” (OCBE) on the relation between “green supply chain management” (GSCM) practices and sustainable performance. The participants of the current study were manufacturing firms, and non-probability convenience sampling technique was used for selecting the sample size. The survey method used while data were collected from manufacturing firms was cross-sectional; a total of 151 responses were received and used in the analysis. For statistical analysis, “SmartPLS partial least square, structural equation modeling” PLS-SEM was used. From the findings, it was evident that in the measurement model, convergent and discriminant validities were established. In the second stage, a structural model was developed for hypotheses testing. It was found that sustainable performance was associated with proposed GSCM practices, excluding environmental management. OCBE being a moderator has significant impacts concerning GSCM operations and sustainability functions of firms. However, OCBE did not play the role of moderator between internal environmental management and EE and sustainable performance. The present study is significant for managers and policymakers for the attainment of competitive advantage, enhancement of OCBE, and sustainable performance. Furthermore, this research study is the first empirical study that has used OCBE as a moderator through the lens of NRBV.

Energies,"The quality of human nutrition has acquired significant improvements thanks to the opportunity to store food in suitable temperature conditions. Refrigeration has allowed the slowing of chemical and biological degradation and hence the waste of foodstuff, but at the same time increases energy consumption. These effects impact the environment and the sustainability performance of the cold chain, and drive consumers’ choices. The stakeholders of the chain are, therefore, constantly looking for improvement actions to reduce environmental impacts. This paper aims to provide a methodology for prioritizing and assessing the energy efficiency measures for cold chains in terms of quality losses and specific energy consumption, distinguishing between technological, maintenance, and managerial opportunities. This analysis is based on the cold supply chain tool, developed under the H2020 project ICCEE (“Improving Cold Chain Energy Efficiency”) which focuses on a holistic approach, not looking only at the individual stages of the cold chain.

Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management,"The raison d'être for this article is simple: traditional ways of researching, theorizing, and practicing purchasing and supply management (PSM) are no longer sufficient to ‘meet the moment’. Scholars need to advance a “business-not-as-usual” footing approach to their work, if they are to make a meaningful contribution to addressing the current and future emergencies, as highlighted by recent extreme weather and the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, what can this, or should this, mean for a field rooted in traditional business thinking? This article builds on the Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management's (JPSM) 25th Anniversary Special Issue editorial (2019); members of the JPSM's editorial team advance their unique perspectives on what “business-not-as-usual” means for PSM. Specifically, we advocate both thinking much more widely, in scope and ambition, than we currently do, and simultaneously building our ability to comprehend supply chains in a more nuanced and granular way. We explore whether the bias toward positivist work has omitted potentially interesting findings, and viewpoints. This leads to a call to re-think how we approach our work: should the key criteria always be to focus on theory development or testing? Should academics “think bigger”? Turning to specific research themes, illustrations of how our current thinking can be challenged or broadened by addressing the circular economy, and role of purchasing and innovation.

Efforts to systematically address the emerging sustainability issues associated with critical minerals have been challenged by complex mineral supply chains, and the distal and geographically dispersed nature of social-ecological impacts from mineral extraction and processing and eventual use. In this review, we apply a bibliometric analysis of the literature in the 2010-2020 period to analyze the state of research on the issues of critical mineral extraction impacts and the global governance responses. We use the concept of telecoupling to structure our literature search and analysis across four themes: (a) critical minerals global trade and supply chain, (b) sustainability and resource policy and governance, (c) mining corporate social responsibility, and (d) information feedback and public discourse. We find a growing attention to the social-ecological implications of critical mineral extraction, but also fragmentation among thematic domains that could impede progress towards more coordinated system governance. Based on the analyses, the paper concludes with a definition of some research and engagement opportunities around the telecoupling themes.","Agusdinata D.B., Eakin H., Liu W.",Critical minerals for electric vehicles: A telecoupling review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123763585&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2fac4763&partnerID=40&md5=ba89abe7a86f5f0d9d272b0574ebecc0
Sustainable Cities and Society,"The rapid growth of population in metropolitan areas has put incremental pressure on urban cities. The centric strategy towards smart cities are expected to cover solution for metropolitan life and ecological environment. One of the significant application areas of IoT in smart cities is the food industry. IoT systems help to monitor, analyze, and manage the real-time food industry in smart cities. In this research, we proposed an IoT based Dynamic Food Supply Chain for Smart Cities which not only ensures the food quality but also provides intelligent vehicle routing as well as tracing sources of contamination in FCM. Furthermore, a smart sensor data collection strategy based on IoT is utilized which would improve the efficiency and accuracy of the supply chain network with the minimized size of dataset and vehicle routing algorithm is introduced and tracing the contamination sources of infected food in the markets.

Procedia CIRP,"The rapid increase in consumption of products and services is leading to the scarcity of resources and environmental crisis. The circular economy was born as a new economic model to solve these problems. It explores new techniques to rethink and redesign products and services and extend their useful life through reusing, remanufacturing, recycling, etc., to maximize the value of resources. The implementation of the circular model entails the adaptation of supply chains. In connection with sustainability, we also need to consider economic, social and environmental dimensions. This makes the evaluation of the circular systems more complex. In the past, various means are presented in the literature to evaluate and understand the sustainable dimensions for the development of the circular economy. However, the evaluation methods and the indicators are heterogeneous. Thus, it is very challenging to obtain standardized information that the different stakeholders will understand. In this paper, through a literature review, we seek to understand the measurement of the sustainable dimensions in the performance of the circular supply chains. This research is part of a thesis work, which aims to study sustainable performance in circular supply chains, grouping economic, management and industrial engineering aspects.","Hernandez Marquina M.V., Le Dain M.-A., Zwolinski P., Joly I.",Sustainable performance of circular supply chains: A literature review.,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127533905&doi=10.1016%2fj.procir.2022.02.101&partnerID=40&md5=6559ee728b2c3a36da9f7ced1c1861ba
Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"The recent advancement of digitalization and information and communication technology (ICT) has not only shifted the manufacturing paradigm towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution, namely Industry 4.0, but also provided opportunities for a smart logistics transformation. Despite studies have focused on improving the smartness, connectivity, and autonomy of isolated logistics operations with a primary focus on the forward channels, there is still a lack of a systematic conceptualization to guide the coming paradigm shift of reverse logistics, for instance, how “individualization” and “service innovation” should be interpreted in a smart reverse logistics context? To fill this gap, Reverse logistics 4.0 is defined, from a holistic perspective, in this paper to offer a systematic analysis of the technological impact of Industry 4.0 on reverse logistics. Based on the reported research and case studies from the literature, the conceptual framework of smart reverse logistics transformation is proposed to link Industry 4.0 enablers, smart service and operation transformation, and targeted sustainability goals. A smart reverse logistics architecture is also given to allow a high level of system integration enabled by intelligent devices and smart portals, autonomous robots, and advanced analytical tools, where the value of technological innovations can be exploited to solve various reverse logistics problems.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has revealed weaknesses in the global food system, with short food supply chains (SFSCs) and long food supply chains (LFSC) being impacted differently. This raises the question as to whether the pandemic has contributed to a greater interest in and demand for locally produced foods. To answer this question, a study was undertaken to explore how consumers perceive SFSCs in delivering social, economic, and environmental benefits and whether these perceptions have been enhanced during the pandemic. A survey was carried out among consumers in Atlantic Canada who purchase food from SFSCs. Based on 80 valid responses, the findings revealed that consumers perceive SFSCs to deliver more social benefits post-pandemic than they thought SFSCs did before the pandemic. Supporting the local economy, food safety, freshness, and product quality are key motivators of shopping from SFSCs. Consumer perceptions about the sustainability of SFSCs did not vary much based on sociodemographic factors. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly alter consumer spending and frequency of shopping from SFSCs. This may affect the SFSCs’ ability to expand operations beyond current levels and suggest the complementarity between SFSCs and LFSCs for more sustainable consumption patterns. The study provides valuable insights into the attractiveness of the local food businesses and the effect of unexpected events such as COVID-19 on consumer behaviors.","Mass M., Abebe G.K., Hartt C.M., Yiridoe E.K.",Consumer Perceptions about the Value of Short Food Supply Chains during COVID-19: Atlantic Canada Perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133834096&doi=10.3390%2fsu14138216&partnerID=40&md5=18259db1e113851a7d457271f9729899
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The relationship between digital technologies and the circular economy, both characterised as disruptive, is attracting increasing attention in company boardrooms, policy and pressure groups and in academic communities. Nevertheless, studies to date highlight a lack of understanding of how digital technologies enable organisations to improve their resource flows and value creation to promote the circular economy. This article looks to address this gap in the academic literature by an examination of if and how a small number of organisations are using digital technologies to support their sustainability objectives and circular economy initiatives. The research approach is inductive, using questionnaires and interviews with IT professionals employed in a range of organisations. The article concludes that where organisations are pursuing circular economy initiatives, the connection with digital technology deployment is not evident, even though a more general association with sustainability is. Digital technologies are bringing about greater efficiencies, improved processes and better data management, which are supporting and enabling sustainability objectives, but a more direct linkage with the circular economy will require clearer use cases of how specific digital technologies can progress the circular economy, both within organisations and across the supply chain. Enhanced information systems that facilitate the reporting and analysis of the operational performance of circular economy activities against set objectives will also be needed.","Wynn M., Jones P.",Digital Technology Deployment and the Circular Economy,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137249631&doi=10.3390%2fsu14159077&partnerID=40&md5=4b39b11f7c172a94883b0f6580fd44fd

Frontiers in Marine Science,"The Republic of Seychelles is one of six African Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and has a marine-based economy reliant on fisheries and international tourism. Seychelles has been flagged by the United Nations as highly vulnerable to climate change. Climatic threats are compounded with population declines of key fishery species. A progressive national stance towards ocean sustainability and an emerging economy partially driven by tourists are two of several factors that make Seychelles a good candidate for a sustainable seafood labelling and consumption programme, which would provide market-based incentives for fishery harvesters, regulators, buyers and consumers to improve sustainable practices. To address the feasibility of such a programme, we conducted a pilot study, surveying 33 artisanal fishers and mapping supply chain structure to examine incentives and challenges. Questions addressed fishers’ years of experience, reliance on fishing for income, and flexibility in gear type and species targeted. Of the total number of respondents, 64% would like to see a programme implemented but only 34% thought it would be successful. Participants identified several barriers and benefits that primarily spanned socioeconomic and regulatory themes. Our pilot results indicate the sociocultural and economic impacts of sustainability programmes in Seychelles are as important as environmental considerations, a finding pertinent to anyone undertaking similar research efforts in other SIDS. We advocate for the necessity of thorough, location-based research and in-depth stakeholder consultation to elucidate economic, societal, behavioural and cultural factors that will affect the success of designing and implementing seafood labelling programmes in SIDS.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"The research aimed to explore the sustainability actions in the Australian horticulture and dairy industries and the influences on firms adopting sustainability. The research adopted a neo-institutional lens and examined the environmental, social, and economic issues faced by these two industries in their operations and their supply chains. The research adopted a qualitative approach with four case studies. Interviews were conducted with decision-makers in the focal firms as well as those in key supply chain partners. One key finding was that motivations differed in the take up of environmental and social sustainability actions, with business imperatives and mimetic influences found in the former, whilst reputation and normative influences were evident in the latter. Environmental actions focused on actions to reduce their carbon footprints such as environmentally friendly packaging, water efficiency, managing waste, and monitoring spray programs. In the dairy industry environmental actions are also related to animal welfare. Social actions predominantly focused on “giving back to the community”. And the adoption of automation was the main economic action. The horticulture sector demonstrated more concern about sustainability in its supply chain, especially in regard to environmental considerations due to economic interdependencies and industry and competitive pressures. Another key finding was regarding sustainability challenges. A key social sustainability challenge was found to be the treatment of temporary backpacker labour which has the potential to seriously damage Australia's clean and green image. In terms of environmental sustainability, severe water shortage and the associated costs were found to be the most challenging. International competitive pressures were highlighted as a key challenge and the need to be sustainable economically was at the forefront of many concerns. In terms of the supply chain, processing firms (upstream) were found to exert a positive and substantial pressure in terms of sustainability practices of their supply chain, whereas, in the dairy sector, the duopoly of retail giants had a significant albeit negative influence on the supply chain's uptake of sustainability practices. Managers' values and links to the local and regional communities played an important part in the adoption of sustainability initiatives and their influence on the supply chain.","Amin-Chaudhry A., Young S., Afshari L.",Sustainability motivations and challenges in the Australian agribusiness,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130414200&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.132229&partnerID=40&md5=f303b66adf5f888349391114f1791d5a

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain (BC), and the internet of things (IoT) has had significant applications in the advancement of sustainability research. This review examines how these digital transformations drive natural and human systems, as well as which industry sectors have been applying them to advance sustainability. We adopted qualitative research methods, including a bibliometric analysis, in which we screened 960 publications to identify the leading sectors that apply AI/BC/IoT, and a content analysis to identify how each sector uses AI/BC/IoT to advance sustainability. We identified “smart city”, “energy system”, and “supply chain” as key leading sectors. Of these technologies, IoT received the most real-world applications in the “smart city” sector under the dimensions of “smart environment” and “smart mobility” and provided applications resolving energy consumption in the “energy system” sector. AI effectively resolved scheduling, prediction, and monitoring for both the “smart city” and “energy system” sectors. BC remained highly theoretical for “supply chain”, with limited applications. The technological integration of AI and IoT is a research trend for the “smart city” and “energy system” sectors, while BC and IoT is proposed for the “supply chain”. We observed a surge in AI/BC/IoT sustainability research since 2016 and a new research trend—technological integration—since 2020.

Combined with energy-efficient continuous processing that consolidates reaction steps, mechanochemistry’s environmental and economic benefits may translate across product supply chains. Here, we evaluate numerous sustainability and green chemistry metrics for producing nitrofurantoin, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), via mechanochemical continuous twin-screw extrusion (TSE) and conventional solvent-batch synthesis methods. We find a significant reduction in all metrics for TSE including energy, climate change, and human and ecological health, as well as cost due to reducing excess reactant consumption and eliminating solvents while maintaining high product selectivity. In addition, replacing the direct energy source to drive the chemical reaction from mostly thermal to electrical sources does not increase the net life cycle energy consumed to produce functionally equivalent API. We conclude that mechanochemical synthesis via TSE holds multiple sustainability benefits for manufacturing APIs and potentially other chemical products.","Galant O., Cerfeda G., McCalmont A.S., James S.L., Porcheddu A., Delogu F., Crawford D.E., Colacino E., Spatari S.",Mechanochemistry Can Reduce Life Cycle Environmental Impacts of Manufacturing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123915652&doi=10.1021%2facssuschemeng.1c06434&partnerID=40&md5=19e5f9118ba95a8ea42e2a7138cbcec8

This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a new conceptual model (CM) for evaluating the effectiveness of IoT technologies in relation to their orientation towards socio-environmental sustainability and the circular economy approach. The research methodology for developing the CM follows the PRISMA protocol, and the data are obtained from the Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier Scopus databases, focusing on the relationship between IoT and sustainable manufacturing. The PRISMA methodology results in six articles whose statements contribute to the development of the CM. The statements are identified, categorized and organized from the selected articles and divided into dimensions, namely: IoT technology and environmental and social context. The CM incorporates these dimensions and their constructs and indicators to support the assessment of the effectiveness of IoT technologies in relation to socio-environmental sustainability and the circular economy approach.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The seafood sector faces both socioeconomic and environmental sustainability challenges, as well as pressure to demonstrate progress from governments, NGOs, retailers, and consumers. To document data elements necessary in verifying key sustainability attributes and fishery progress, the sector needs to implement traceability systems accessible to fishers and other vulnerable nearshore actors. Implementation must overcome a suite of technological, social, and economic barriers. We assessed and reviewed the efficacy of several approaches attempted in a Philippines yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) fishery. The current prevailing approach is a centralized, analog method of catch recording, both broadly across the Philippines and specifically in this MSC-certified fishery, where they have implemented enumerator-facilitated catch certificate recording. The fishery has begun developing, testing, and piloting new decentralized digital models, including NFC cards, RFID tags, and an app-based smartphone catch data capture.

"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part O: Journal of Risk and Reliability","The selection of appropriate suppliers in an uncertain environment influences the sustainability and the competitive advantage of the automotive industry and hence presents one of the significant management problems. In the literature, it is suggested that an acceptable supplier may be determined concerning many criteria. In this manuscript, criteria selection is based on the relevant literature. Handling of different uncertainties is performed by using the type-2 fuzzy sets that have the capability of handling more considered impreciseness and uncertainties. In the presented research, the two-state model is proposed. In the first stage, the relative importance of criteria and sub-criteria are described by pre-defined linguistic expressions which are modeled by the interval type-2 triangular fuzzy numbers (IT2TFNs). The fuzzy weights vectors are given by using the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchical Process with IT2TFNs (IT2FAHP). After that, the ranking of suppliers is based on the modified Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison method (MABAC) with IT2TFNs (IT2FMABAC). The extension of the conventional MABAC includes: (a) modeling of sub-criteria values of IT2TFNs, (b) the fuzzy criteria values are calculated by using fuzzy algebra rules, (c) belonging of each supplier to border approximation areas (BAAs) is given by using procedure, and (d) the distance of suppliers to BAAs is determined by using the normalized Euclidean distance formulas.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The selection of proper healthcare device suppliers in sustainable organ transplantation networks has become an essential topic of increasing life expectancy. Assessment of sustainable healthcare device suppliers can be regarded as a complex multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem that consists of multiple alternative solutions with sustainable criteria. For this reason, this paper proposes a new integrated MCDM model based on combining an extended vlsekriterijuska optimizacija i komoromisno resenje (E-VIKOR) and measurement alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution (MARCOS) approaches under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs). The aggregating technique of the E-VIKOR method is a strong point of this method compared to the original approach. The IVIFS is taken to cope with the uncertain situation of real-world applications. In this regard, an IVIF-similarity measure is introduced to compute weights of the decision-makers (DMs). The IVIF-Shannon entropy method is utilized to calculate the criteria weights, and a new hybrid proposed model is developed by presenting the IVIF-E-VIKOR method and IVIF-MARCOS, to calculate the ranking of sustainable supplier alternatives in organ transplantation networks to supply the surgery devices. Afterward, an illustrative example is introduced to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, and a comparative analysis is presented to confirm and validate the proposed approach. Moreover, sensitivity analysis for essential parameters of the proposed model is performed to assess their effects on outcomes.","Salimian S., Mousavi S.M., Antucheviciene J.",An Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Model Based on Extended VIKOR and MARCOS for Sustainable Supplier Selection in Organ Transplantation Networks for Healthcare Devices,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129718929&doi=10.3390%2fsu14073795&partnerID=40&md5=d90e5e526c23d9f946b00ecfa4817fcf
Fuel,"The selection of sustainable alternative aviation fuels (AAFs) plays an essential function in the success of fuel supply chain management. Traditional and classical multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods are contributed to making decisions under a deterministic condition, and assume that decision-makers (DMs) are absolutely rational when coping with various risks. Nevertheless, it is difficult that these hypotheses are applied in the process of complex AAF evaluation. The complexity associated with the AAFs’ sustainability evaluation primarily origins from the fuzzy and ambiguous assessment information, DMs’ subjective preferences, different opinions and thoughts among DMs with respect with criteria. Unfortunately, previous studies failed to solve these problems thoroughly. To fill such a gap, a novel hybrid five-phase fuzzy MCDM approach is put forward by integrating interval valued triangle fuzzy numbers (IVTFNs), IVTFN-AHP, IVTFN-TOPSIS, and cumulative prospect theory in this study. It can effectively deal with uncertainty in this process, particularly the cumulative prospect theory enables to well depict DMs’ risk preference of and expresses their actual opinions. Afterwards, four alternative aviation fuels (i.e., Algal-based fuel (A1), Petroleum refining (A2), Soybean -based fuel (A3), and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis based on natural gas (A4)) are studied to illustrate the application of the proposed method, the results demonstrate that the sustainability order from the best to the worst determined based on the opinions of the five groups of DMs is A1, A3, A2, and A4, meaning that Algal-based fuel achieves higher energy efficiencies and fewer greenhouse gas emissions than other alternative fuels. In order to further investigate the robustness and rationality of this approach, sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis are also carried out in this study.","Chai N., Zhou W.",A novel hybrid MCDM approach for selecting sustainable alternative aviation fuels in supply chain management,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134318249&doi=10.1016%2fj.fuel.2022.125180&partnerID=40&md5=57b64190d5a71ff6fc0dba2e0f41c8ef
Energies,"The shift from an industrial to a post‐industrial economic system encourages an alternative to the globalized food chains—short food supply chain initiatives, which come alongside the servitization concept and are often discussed in the context of sustainability.

All three paradigm innovations are closely related to each other, but each changes a certain dimension of the mental model concerning the food production and delivery system. The article examines the organizational model of the alternative local food market in Lithuania that has been designed according to the “new rules of game” suggested by the post‐industrial economic system.","Lankauskienė R., Vidickienė D., Gedminaitė‐raudonė Ž.",Evolution of Short Food Supply Chain Theory and Practice: Two‐Sided Networks and Platforms,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124340412&doi=10.3390%2fen15031137&partnerID=40&md5=f46ca4b746202b784353f6157850d4fb
Production Planning and Control,"The shipbuilding industry is under significant economic pressure and in need of more efficient solutions to secure economically sustainable operations. It is also challenged by social issues and the need for a greener maritime industry is critical. Accordingly, the shipbuilding industry is pressured across all three dimensions of sustainability. This paper aims to identify the sustainability challenges in shipbuilding supply chains and explore how Industry 4.0 technologies can impact the sustainability of shipbuilding. This is achieved through a case study of a shipbuilding supply chain, which results in the identification of its primary sustainability challenges. Further, this work proposes a set of nine digital solutions to support sustainable operations in shipbuilding as the paper’s primary contribution. This lays the foundation for further empirical research on sustainability and digitalization in shipbuilding, while for practice the paper provides enhanced insight into how Industry 4.0 technologies can be adopted in shipbuilding supply chains.","Strandhagen J.W., Buer S.-V., Semini M., Alfnes E., Strandhagen J.O.",Sustainability challenges and how Industry 4.0 technologies can address them: a case study of a shipbuilding supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094622189&doi=10.1080%2f09537287.2020.1837940&partnerID=40&md5=c5c877c2a2dc50eb1661e4d682ac8dd4
Research Anthology on Measuring and Achieving Sustainable Development Goals,"The significance of sustainability is continually expanding among researchers, policymakers, and decision makers. To improve the efficiency of value chain activities such as manufacturing, distribution, and consumption, an innovative research solution has been proposed: ‘Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) through Information and Communication Technology (ICT)’. Sustainability through ICT is significant for the industry in terms of its sustainable effects on production processes, environment, and community. This research seeks to gauge ICT—as knowledge management—for industries in the successful adoption and execution of SCP. In so doing, potential key ICT-based factors to SCP are identified from the literature and experts’ feedback. The present work suggests a decision framework for assessing the interrelationships among and between the ICT oriented factors by utilizing graph theory and matrix approach. Data for this work derives from three automotive companies operating in India. From findings, ‘Governance and Management’, is the topmost factor for the adoption of sustainable consumption and production in value chains. The relationship among the index values is further evalu-ated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.

Environmental Footprints and Eco-Design of Products and Processes,"The smart city idea is discussed in the literature in multitude of ways. Researcher Komninos specifies the smart cities and surrounding larger regions as environments with a high potential for learning and innovation, utilizing the ingenuity of population and societies with digital infrastructures to function in the physical, uniform, and numerical spaces of cities. The smart city model is defined in the literature in numerous types of ways. As cities develop and expand their services, governance and management are becoming more and more complex. Consequently, cities must adapt to address the economic, social, engineering, and environmental challenges of these transformations. Cities must become smart to face the challenges properly and increase livability and quality of life. This secondary research utilizes detailed literature review of multifaceted sources of information, such as peer-reviewed and quality academic journal articles from renowned databases. With the introduction of blockchain, numerous fields like banking, finance, health care, and supply chain shall experience positive effects.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"The sourcing of renewable bio-resources and their conversion through novel biorefinery technology is being supported by several initiatives and policies worldwide involving the development of a circular bioeconomy. However, further questions remain unanswered such as how the strategic planning of new bio-based supply chains could contribute to sustainability targets given the common oversight for the social dimension in decision-making levels of biorefinery supply chains. Based on a systematic literature review of research papers on biorefineries, bottlenecks associated with the strategic planning of new supply chains from feedstocks originating from land and marine ecosystems were identified, along with the aspects currently representing the social dimension of sustainability. The results outline two main findings. First, the bottlenecks identified and portrayed by grass and seaweed-based supply chains can be summed into the following main categories: bio-resource availability, quality, logistic planning, economic, ecological, and social issues, policy, research and innovation. Second, current research at the strategic decision-making levels of biorefineries is substantially focused on techno-economic aspects. The inclusion of environmental aspects has been increasing with life cycle assessment methodologies in more recent years, while social elements remain widely disregarded. The results further uncover the social dimension, represented by aspects such as employment creation, participation of primary producers, food and energy security, stakeholders' engagement, societal acceptance, effects on local communities, workers' well-being, education, gender equality, cultural values, and potential conflicts. To overcome bottlenecks and incorporate social dimensions, new perspectives and interdisciplinarity are needed to extrapolate the boundaries of analytical frameworks currently adopted by biorefinery research. We suggest framing the planning of new bio-based supply chains within a socio-technical-ecological system to pursue integrated strategies toward more sustainable and socially relevant biorefinery systems.","Cerca M., Sosa A., Gusciute E., Murphy F.",Strategic planning of bio-based supply chains: Unlocking bottlenecks and incorporating social sustainability into biorefinery systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138777540&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.09.013&partnerID=40&md5=b7238b9533148bcb5928c214c3079e04
Economies,"The spread of blockchain technology is gaining ground worldwide, including in the supply chain and logistics sector. Its proliferation is expected to transform supply chains. Academic research is needed to investigate the reasons for and barriers to adoption. The objective of this study is to explore the blockchain (BC) platform and its inputs as technological solutions. In addition, the application of blockchain technology in managing supply chain (SC) business processes like shipment tracking, authenticity, and identification is also a focus of research. This research was carried out in three ways to explore the issue. Expert interviews were used to develop a research framework for the comparative analysis of BC platforms to find out the benefits and the barriers of blockchain adoption. In association with the diffusion of the technology, a qualitative comparative analysis was applied to benchmark blockchain platform providers. We analysed the blockchain-supply chain market by component, provider, type, and the conditions of usage. As part of this research, the Forbes TOP 50 companies were analysed by business area, country of origin, application area, and benefits in order to see in which area they applied blockchain technology and what improvements they have achieved. The results revealed that blockchain use in supply chains of selected industries has outstanding benefits of transparency, trustworthiness, traceability, and cost efficiencies which give businesses an advantage in terms of implementation costs, technology needs, human resources, legal environments, volatile costs, and security. In the supply chain, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum are the most widely used blockchain platforms.

Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,"The spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy, in the period March–May 2020, quickly triggered a deep crisis, causing an immediate economic slowdown and consequently a strong contraction in domestic demand and trade. The food supply chain faced severe difficulties, although its anti-cyclical nature allowed for greater resilience compared to other economic sectors. In this framework of ongoing uncertainty, it is important to understand the response of farms to the crisis, and their role in the sustainability of the post-pandemic food supply chain, even for future policy interventions in the short and medium term. The purpose of the paper is to investigate how diversification affected the response of farms to the Covid-19 crisis, and explore whether the changes required by the post-crisis scenario can produce opportunities for their activities. The study investigates a sample of fifteen farms in central Italy through semi-structured interviews, performing a lexicon-based text and sentiment analysis. The results highlight the importance of farm diversification in dealing with the Covid-19 crisis, and emphasise the role of diversified farms for the sustainability of the agri-food system. These results have interesting policy implications, particularly regarding support for the competitiveness of farms by improving sustainable logistics, electronic commerce and exchanges of knowledge and innovations among farmers; these measures should be taken into account to target the future agricultural, rural and food policies, at both national and local level.","Mastronardi L., Cavallo A., Romagnoli L.",How did Italian diversified farms tackle Covid-19 pandemic first wave challenges?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126962703&doi=10.1016%2fj.seps.2021.101096&partnerID=40&md5=54e3bacb1c74803fbdbfddbabc574993

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The supplier selection process is a strategic decision-making process that influences the company’s sustainability. Lately, the sustainability concept has been highlighted as an organization’s source of success and profitability. Therefore, the selection of a sustainable supplier has become an imperative for organizations and is the focus of this manuscript. Suppliers are key stakeholders in the supply chain, and their proper selection is a key factor in a successful and sustainable supply chain. For this reason, it is crucial to determine how and which methods are mostly used by companies when choosing sustainable suppliers with the aim of examining whether the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) contributes to the same. This article is the first to present a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 87 articles dealing with the application of DEA in the sustainable supplier selection in the period 2010–2022, with the application of the keywords “Data Envelopment Analysis”, “Supplier”, and “Sustainable” in Scopus and Web of Science databases. The main goal of this manuscript is to explore the applications of DEA in a sustainable supplier selection and to provide an analysis and visualization of bibliometric data to reveal the annual trends of published articles in this area, the top contributing journals, the most cited papers, the most contributing authors, citations, affiliations, and countries’ analysis, and an in-depth keyword visualization analysis. The findings of this study provide valuable insights and emphasize the ever-growing trend toward the selection of sustainable partners and suppliers in business using DEA methodology. Notably, this work shows the applicability and efficacy of DEA in specialized areas of supply chain management and should contribute to the construction of an overview of the existing literature on DEA studies regarding the process of selection of sustainable suppliers in supply chain management as well as stimulate the interest in the topic.

"Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance and Fraud","The supply shocks that emerged with the deterioration of the supply chain and the narrowing of liquidity facilities in the COVID-19 pandemic brought demand shocks by narrowing production and employment. This has taken the epidemic beyond a health crisis. In order to solve the crisis caused by supply and demand shocks, the need to implement expansionary monetary and fiscal policies together has arisen. The most important tool that can be used in fiscal policy is public transfer expenditures. Transfer expenditure is a type of expenditure against which there is no corresponding transfer of goods, services or production factors. Although these expenditures do not directly increase the goods, services or production factors, they can contribute to the accumulation or improvement of outputs/factors in the economy. Social transfer expenditures play a critical role in protecting purchasing power, meeting minimum living standards, expanding the scope of social security; economic transfer expenditures ensure the continuity of production and employment. Unemployment payments, direct income support, social assistance and grants have provided widely in developed countries. Developing countries, on the other hand, have the risk of inadequate demand-side policies due to the financial risks, the narrow fiscal space and the low expenditure multiplier. Turkey, which has determined a demand-oriented economic growth strategy, has faced problems such as high exchange rates, budget deficits, and increase in debt stock for the last few years. The uncertainty and insecurity created by COVID-19 have made this growth strategy of Turkey hard. Shortly after the first COVID-19 case was announced in the country, administrative measures were taken and public life was limited. These measures had negative economic consequences. In the first months of the pandemic, a contraction process was observed in all sectors of the economy. The Economic Stability Shield Package was put into effect for the rapid recovery of the economy. Within the scope of the package, applications such as tax reductions, tax deferrals, deferral of loan and interest payments, loan support packages, increasing pensions, minimum wage support and short-time working allowance can be listed. In the process, sectors such as construction, manufacturing and industry entered into a rapid recovery process. However, the expected improvement in sectors such as tourism, transportation, accommodation, food, culture, arts, entertainment and sports could not be realized due to the severity of the pandemic. While the new waves of the pandemic continued, public transfer expenditures continued to be presented. Tax, loan and interest payments have been postponed and the duration of the short-time working allowance has been extended. The supports provided in Turkey, it is seen that monetary policy is heavily utilized. Credit support packages such as individual basic needs, tradesmen, housing, vehicle and vacation were provided and the demand side was tried to be kept alive. In the field of social transfers—direct income supports, cash aids and grants—lagged significantly behind credit supports. Considering the projections for Turkey, additional social transfer expenditures should be made ready to be presented in order to protect the purchasing power of households.

In this study, closed-loop supply chain themed studies that deal with three pillars of sustainability in the literature were examined based on sub-factors. Studies have shown that, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) methods such as ReCipe, Eco-Indicator 99 and CO2 emission are the approaches used to determine the environmental factors of sustainability. Cost, proﬁt and Net Present Value (NPV) methods are used to measure the economic dimension of sustainability. Job opportunities, losses and Customer Service Level (CSL) are most commonly used as sub-criteria to determine social factors. Accordingly, a sustainable closed-loop supply chain model consisting of seven echelons has been examined. A deterministic mixed integer linear programming model (MILP), which includes the economic dimension of sustainability, has been developed and enclosed with sample solutions. Suggestions for sustainability criteria and improving the proposed model have been made for future studies.","Yozgat S., Erol S.",Sustainable Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Design and Optimization,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134558899&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-10388-9_52&partnerID=40&md5=f908e24946359f4178f718c066088ab6
Journal of Consumer Affairs,"The sustainability of Fair Trade ultimately relies on consumers choosing fair-traded products. To date, research has tended to study consumer and producer engagement, and reactions to Fair Trade separately. These areas do, however, interconnect systematically through supply chains. In this paper, we introduce a self-catalyzing model of Fair Trade which acknowledges those interconnections, traces them along supply chains from producer to consumer and addresses different international development priorities articulated in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Its conceptual elements span (a) product quality, in this case, taste experience influenced by organoleptic properties and moral satisfaction; (b) organizational morality via corporate social responsibility and living wages; and (c) strategic management of slack farming resources—each catalyzed by, and catalyzing, positive emotions. Contingencies at each point in the model alter the likelihood that produce will be and feel fair and taste better to consumers.

Scientific Programming,"The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations prioritize sustainability by 2030. The fashion industry is one most substantial manufacturing industries that generate an economy of 3 trillion dollars and contributes to 2% of the world's gross domestic product. In addition to this, the fashion industry must focus on social and environmental concerns, where it should create fashionable products to promote sustainable consumption and production. Sustainable consumption and production can be achieved with the establishment of resilient infrastructure with innovation. The resilient infrastructure with innovation is realized by the integration of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). With this motivation, this study explored the different studies that implemented these technologies in the fashion industry for smart cloth (health), supply chain, circular economy, dress recommendation system, fashion trend forecasting, health prediction, and virtual and augmented based shopping experience. Along with the progress of these technologies in the fashion industry, the study also discussed limitations and provided recommendations such as wide adoption of blockchain in fashion supply chain; advancement in energy storage for smart cloth; integration of IoT, AI, and edge computing; and smart clothing-based framework for rescue operation for future enhancement.","Akram S.V., Malik P.K., Singh R., Gehlot A., Juyal A., Ghafoor K.Z., Shrestha S.",Implementation of Digitalized Technologies for Fashion Industry 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137131762&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f7523246&partnerID=40&md5=a628a6a72ecfc7390319ace5350ec951
Science of the Total Environment,"The sustainable food supply chain (SFSC) is a research area of global significance. The increasing number of research articles in SFSC justifies this. With 80% of publications in SFSC coming up in the last 7 years, this field is expanding and diversifying at a rapid rate. The research on sustainable food supply chain (SFSC) covers a wide variety of areas and has a wide range of research themes in FSC. To facilitate the theoretical understanding of SFSC, we have conducted a review of the literature on SFSC. With the aim to define prominent research themes in SFSC, we follow an integrated review approach of structured literature review (SLR), bibliometric analysis, and thematic analysis. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using the vosviewer software version 1.6.16. The thematic analysis identified- “Waste management”, “SC sustainability and impact assessment”, “Decision support”, “Operations management and optimization”, “Food quality and safety”, “Sustainable business models”, “Innovation and technological solution”, “SC strategy”, and “Social sustainability” as the key emergent themes. We discuss the conceptual and theoretical basis of each of these themes. “SC sustainability and impact assessment” is identified as the most dominant theme in SFSC. Innovation and technological solution is an emerging theme with many new publications related to disruptive technologies coming up. Research in collaboration and decision theory-based approaches is important to enable sustainability in FSC. Quantifying waste streams, identifying hotspots are important future directions of research in SFSCM. Circular economy, AFSC, and the use of advanced technologies to enable circularity and sustainability also have great scope.

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","The sustainable transition, which requires a combination of natural and human resources to foster the development and protection of ecosystems, is a challenge of civil society. New approaches may be proposed to support enterprises in identifying the appropriate strategic criteria for their sustainability initiatives, which are eventually documented in corporate sustainability reports. The present paper focuses on the food industry, particularly with regard to pasta production. The analytic hierarchy process method was used to assign relevance to sustainability criteria, according to the judgment of 10 academic experts. The initial criteria were selected from the sustainability reports of a virtuous and Italian pasta producer, La Molisana S.p.A., and divided into four categories: (1) people and community, (2) innovation and new product development, (3) commitment to the environment and (4) local supply chain and traceability. Promotion of social and economic development in the local community emerged as the most relevant criterion, followed by business development and promotion of talent. The people and community category was deemed most strategic for sustainability, while social and economic dimensions were given less relevance. Stakeholder engagement was proposed as an order winner for sustainable strategies. The present work has relevant methodological implications, as it shows that the analytic hierarchy process, applied in conjunction with a sustainability materiality matrix, may provide new and useful information for strategy and communication. In terms of operational implications, an enterprise’s historical connection to an area may attract global recognition and increase brand value through higher raw material quality, the harmonisation of human and natural resources, and synergy with the tourism industry.",D’Adamo I.,The analytic hierarchy process as an innovative way to enable stakeholder engagement for sustainability reporting in the food industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139644934&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-022-02700-0&partnerID=40&md5=e2136918ae1be3b1ffdb003d7e461e52
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The swine diet formulation in the United States of America (U.S.A.) is entering a new era of decision making to promote low-carbon pork production systems. As a part of the decision-making process, the precision nutrition approaches to customize diet and alternative feeding options that are economically viable and environmentally sustainable are given priority. Hence, the objective of this study is to identify an alternative diet over a standard corn–soybean meal diet. The byproducts from the supply chain of human food and biofuels, i.e., distiller-dried grain with solubles (DDGS), are chosen as an alternative option to formulate a swine diet. First, two alternative byproduct diets with low and high DDGS inclusion (10.1% and 28.8%, respectively) were formulated using the least-cost technique. Second, a life cycle inventory was created, followed by data collection from the key sources, including DATA SMART-2017, USDA, RIA-GREET 2018, and the relevant literature. Third, in SimaPro 8.5.2.0 (PRé Sustainability: LE Amersfoort, The Netherlands), the ReCiPe 2016, the midpoint method by economic allocation was used to investigate the environmental footprint of the formulated diets to inform sustainability decisions of swine-farm managers. The considered functional unit is the ‘lb diet’, and the system boundary is the farm gate that considers only the feed production stage. The observed results include global warming potential, land use, water consumption, fossil resources scarcity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. The comparative results of a 28.8% DDGS diet over the standard corn–soybean meal diet for the displacement ratio of 0.69 show an approximate global warming potential saving of 0.04 kg CO2 eq. per lb DDGS feed at the feed production stage. Moreover, the DDGS displacement ratio of 0.69 does not significantly impact water consumption and fossil resources; however, it can reduce land use by 26% and terrestrial ecotoxicity by 8% compared to the standard diet. Overall, the quantified environmental footprint results of the byproduct DDGS diets indicate that the footprints of DDGS diets were lower than the standard diet.","Haque M.A., Liu Z., Demilade A., Kumar N.M.",Assessing the Environmental Footprint of Distiller-Dried Grains with Soluble Diet as a Substitute for Standard Corn–Soybean for Swine Production in the United States of America,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123102093&doi=10.3390%2fsu14031161&partnerID=40&md5=1f0c7123cd67f0d8b83719090fa3b3bb
International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,"The synergy between Distributed Ledger Technologies, like blockchain technology and circular economy, can lead to economic, environmental, and social sustainability through protecting natural resources, optimizing processes, fostering system effectiveness, designing out waste, and also providing job opportunities. Nevertheless, industries and their supply chain need to consider several requirements for blockchain implementation to realize a circular economy. To achieve this goal, requirements for implementing blockchain technology in construction supply chain were prioritized based on circular economy attributes. For multiple-criteria decision analysis and making our preference decision, we employed the new-founded multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method, the “Fuzzy Ordinal Priority Approach (Fuzzy OPA).” Under uncertainty conditions, this method can determine fuzzy weights of circular economy attributes and fuzzy scores of blockchain requirements using linguistic variables. The results obtained from the case study show that three high-ranked requirements for implementing blockchain are (1) developing circular economy attributes on platforms, (2) intra-organizational considerations, and (3) technological requirements and collaboration infrastructure. To discuss the circular economy, we used the ReSOLVE framework, consisting of six attributes “Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, and Exchange.” According to research findings, blockchain implementation can move the construction industry toward a circular economy through (1) regenerating environment, (2) optimizing systems performance, and (3) looping and circulating products.","Sadeghi M., Mahmoudi A., Deng X., Luo X.",Prioritizing requirements for implementing blockchain technology in construction supply chain based on circular economy: Fuzzy Ordinal Priority Approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132851119&doi=10.1007%2fs13762-022-04298-2&partnerID=40&md5=963412a9c0bec201cbcd48c1b92130d7

"Environment, Development and Sustainability","The terms sustainability in the supply chain has increasingly received significant attention in academia and industries in recent years, which obliges the government and private sectors to adhere sustainability. In this regard, businesses are responsible for their activities’ social, environmental, and economic aspects, named triple bottom line. This paper studies sustainable supply chain practices in the mobile industry aiming at exploring sustainable supply chain practices under context of big data. In addition, the relationship of circular economy versus sustainability is under discussion and remains ambiguous. This research contributes to this discussion by providing new insight into exploring the role of circular economy in basic and advanced sustainable supply chain practices. The main focus of this paper is to investigate customers’ points of view since it is desirable and imperative to reach their expectations. From customers’ point of view, sustainability governs their health and environment resulting in persuading decision makers’ sensitivity to customers’ perceptions and pressures in formulating supply chain strategies. Therefore, we conducted a thematic analysis, a powerful method that strives to understand experiences and opinions on social media from August 2017 to July 2019 looking over customers’ perceptions patterns. The findings reveal that environmental practices in the basic and advanced categories have the most significant attention compared to other triple bottom line dimensions by customers on social media. The findings reflect strong relation between advanced sustainable supply chain practices and circular economy.

Waste Management and Research,"The textile and clothing industry sector has today a big environmental impact, not only due to the consumption of water and the use of toxic chemicals but also due to the increasing levels of textile waste. One way to reduce the problem is to circularise the, currently linear, textile and clothing value chain, by using discarded clothes as raw material for the production of new clothes, transforming it into a model of circular economy. This way, while reducing the need to produce new raw materials (e.g. cotton), the problem of textile waste produced is also reduced, thus contributing to a more sustainable industry. In this article, we review the current approaches for traceability in the textile and clothing value chain, and study a set of technologies we deem essential for promoting the circular economy in this value chain – namely, the blockchain technology – for registering activities on traceable items through the value chain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, for easily identifying the traceable items’ digital twins.","Alves L., Ferreira Cruz E., Lopes S.I., Faria P.M., Rosado da Cruz A.M.",Towards circular economy in the textiles and clothing value chain through blockchain technology and IoT: A review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118246449&doi=10.1177%2f0734242X211052858&partnerID=40&md5=40d5f39764c11b0fd94b0a279a6e0728

Melliand International,"The textile industry is too often environmentally harmful and not very people friendly. However, things cannot go on like this, and many stakeholders now agree. 12.5% of the global fashion market has already committed itself to the circular economy. This trend is on the rise, while 1 in 3 consumers has already purchased something sustainable. Those who have the opportunity to do so seem to reach for sustainable products, but the majority of consumers are sticking to the low-priced offers. Price often plays a major role, and sustainably produced textiles are often a more expensive alternative. Politicians want this to change, which is why the previous German government launched the Supply Chain Sourcing Obligations Act (LkSG). It will apply to companies with 3,000 or more employees from 2023, and 1 year later it will apply to all organizations with more than 1,000 employees. In accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, it obliges companies to determine the extent to which their business activities may lead to human rights violations and environmental pollution and to prevent this in the future.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The thriving circular economy is expected to contribute to all three dimensions of sustainable development: environmental, economic, and social. This paper aims to propose a framework to assess social indicators to support circular business models. To validate the framework, we conducted a case study in a medium-size Italian footwear luxury industry, using the Value Focused Thinking–VFT. This approach was used to define proper social indicators to measure the perception of the company’s managers related to the level of incorporation of social dilemmas in the company. We collect data through interviews, documental analysis and direct observation from October/2019 until August/2020 and apply a questionnaire in 2020/2021.

Another novelty is related to the analysis of indicators in terms of strategic, tactical, and operational levels, similarly to the idea of a Balanced Scorecard, which was allowed by applying the VFT approach.","Bianchini A., Guarnieri P., Rossi J.",A Framework to Assess Social Indicators in a Circular Economy Perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133585961&doi=10.3390%2fsu14137970&partnerID=40&md5=96c103bf4adf04469e6765347baf93e2
Supply Chain Forum,"The tourism industry was seen as one of the main beneficiaries of globalisation prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, while tourism is a major driver of economic growth and social well-being, a transformation of the industry towards more sustainable practices along the tourism supply chain (TSC) is needed to ensure that sustainable development goals can be reached. As sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices are critical for this transformation, the present study maps previous research on SSCM in tourism within a systematic literature review. Based on an analysis of 44 peer-reviewed journal papers, we found a strong emphasis on tour operators, hotels, and transport providers being concerned with practicing SSCM while actors managing the destination (e.g., Destination Management Organizations) have rarely been studied. Sustainability practices in TSCs can be enhanced by linking traditional and non-traditional actors on the multiple tiers and levels of a tourist destination.

Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,"The traditional agricultural supply chain (ASC) has been overwhelmed by several challenges, including financing risk, counterparty risk, and lack of consumer trust. Platforms based on blockchain technology combined with Internet-of-Things technology have emerged to address these challenges by improving supply chain visibility, guaranteeing the execution of contracts, and increasing the authenticity of products’ provenance information in the ASC. This study analyzes how the adoption of a blockchain-based platform can affect the decisions of ASC participants and identifies how the platform creates value for the supply chain by addressing these three challenges. We consider a two-level supply chain featuring a typical cooperative and a buyer and establish stylized game models with and without the blockchain-based platform. By comparing equilibrium outcomes with and without the blockchain-based platform, we show that the involvement of the blockchain-based platform can lead to increased production quantity and total surplus of the supply chain. This can also motivate more sustainability/green investment to produce greener products. Interestingly, we show that the value of the blockchain-based platform decreases in the credibility of the business environment in which the supply chain operates. Furthermore, the buyer will always benefit from the established blockchain-based platform, whereas the cooperative can benefit in most cases but could be worse off under certain conditions. The adoption and operational costs could outweigh the benefits caused by the addition of the blockchain-based platform.","Cao Y., Yi C., Wan G., Hu H., Li Q., Wang S.",An analysis on the role of blockchain-based platforms in agricultural supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131052584&doi=10.1016%2fj.tre.2022.102731&partnerID=40&md5=b17be5f6a9b9c8209d3aab300d3cbe78
IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,"The traditional construction logistics is managed in silos, which leads to time losses on sites and increased project costs due to repeated handling/moving of materials. Moreover, these uncontrolled flows of deliveries also have a proved environmental impact. Alternative approaches intend to centralize these flows using a Construction Consolidation Centre (CCC), which allows to deliver material just-in-time as a kit, directly at the workplace. The purpose of this research is to evaluate if this supply chain management methods can drive the construction sectors towards more efficient and sustainable practices. Therefore, this paper describes, from the General Contractor's perspective, the implementation of a CCC between 2019 and 2020 for a Residential Tower project, for the first time in Luxembourg. Increased productivity, reduced costs, and reduced carbon footprint of the transportation flows were observed based on measures throughout the entire project. Beyond these evidences that more sustainable practices are achievable in construction, the paper discusses adherence of workers and subcontractors as well as organisational and technological prerequisites and perspectives. Accordingly, this collaborative model appears as a relevant way to build and strengthen partnerships between the construction stakeholders by improving day-to-day work.

"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity","The traditional global food supply chains are not just complex, but they do not support the sustainability of agriculture. The business models with the greatest growth potential are those that would allow consumers to buy more directly from producers. Before COVID-19, these alternatives were not just popular but had a relatively high market share compared to post COVID-19 era. However, due to the pandemic and the changes in consumers’ purchasing behavior, the players of short food supply chains had to adapt to the new circumstances. This is why business model innovation is nowadays a priority, which means a substantial renewal of the value delivered to customers, and a significant transformation of the processes and activities of the company/network. The study aimed to examine the dynamic innovation through applied digital marketing solutions that could open up new sales channels and increase the competitiveness of the companies involved. Since Austria is one of the “greenest” countries, its consumers are interested in purchasing sustainably, so they strive to buy directly from the producers. This motivates the authors to use its representative sample to investigate how well adapted the Austrian direct sellers are to the unsteady circumstances. Based on a previous research framework, a principal component analysis was applied and the elements defined therein were the variables of non-hierarchical clustering. The used methods highlight the lack of online distribution and marketing of the farmer shops, which could multiply the harmful effects of the pandemic. The classification of the shops demonstrated the generally low share of innovative direct sellers.

Energy Economics,"The transition of societies to a low carbon future presents several important political economy challenges. For example, can the deployment of low carbon solutions deliver economic prosperity and support policy makers in developing decarbonisation policy pathways around which societal and political consensus can build and be sustained? Taking the example of decarbonising private transport in the UK, we use a computable general equilibrium model – informed by energy systems analysis – to consider the potential wider economy impacts, over different timeframes, of electricity network upgrade costs to enable the EV rollout required by 2050. We demonstrate opportunities for both transitory and sustained gains in GDP, employment, and earnings across the UK economy. The key source of sustained expansion is the strength of domestic supply chains supporting the UK electricity sector. However, the transition pathway is sensitive to how network upgrade costs and trajectories respond to the speed of consumer behaviour adjustments, and to the price impacts of constrained wider economy expansion, with notable implications for the price of electricity. The key outcome of concern for UK policymakers is how a lasting constraint on total labour supply means that the EV rollout is associated with lasting impacts on electricity and other consumer prices.","Alabi O., Turner K., Katris A., Calvillo C.","Can network spending to support the shift to electric vehicles deliver wider economy gains?

IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,"The transition to a Circular Economy (CE) requires designers to, more than ever, concurrently develop a circular design, supply chain and business model, and anticipate how products and buildings function over time. To address these challenges, recent studies identified specific knowledge and competencies for designers. However, it remains unknown to what extent future designers (students) are prepared to address the CE in design practice. Therefore, this study investigates how architecture students currently interpret the CE concept and whether that aligns with how they apply the concept in a design assignment. For two years, a workshop was organized with a total of 320 architecture students. The students utilized a card-based circular design tool to conceptualise circular solutions for cases varying in scale and context. According to the students, the main challenge of design for a CE relates to holistic perspectives and systems thinking. The students associate the CE strongly with the reuse of existing (waste) materials, yet results of the design assignment show holistic and diverse approaches of incorporating CE principles. The study identified slight discrepancies between experienced challenges and reported necessary knowledge of designing for a CE, which could relate to the changing role of architects in a CE.","Dokter G., Jansen B.W., Thuvander L., Rahe U., Duijghuisen J.A.",Cards for Circularity (CFC): Reflections on the use of a card-based circular design tool in design education,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139127486&doi=10.1088%2f1755-1315%2f1078%2f1%2f012057&partnerID=40&md5=bde07e5828aa9b806b5d69adf649b8dd
Industrial Marketing Management,"The transition to a circular supply chain is a prerequisite for the agri-food sector to address growing consumer pressure for sustainability while meeting the required standards of quality and safety. Although traceability systems contribute notably to agri-food sustainability, their function as a core mechanism for monitoring and managing the transition from linear to circular supply chains has been neglected. Our objective in this study is to explore the role of traceability in the transition to sustainability-driven circular agri-food supply chains. We employ an end-to-end supply chain investigation, using a consumer-focused survey and a Delphi study of supply chain stakeholders from farm to shelf. Our results suggest that traceability plays a pivotal role in this process. The acceptance of traceability systems begins with the consumer and moves upstream, from fork to farm, acting as a catalyst through stakeholders' adoption towards a circular economy. A change at the consumer level drives changes in the supply chain and eventually at the company level. This study is the first to introduce a traceability angle to the current literature on sustainable agri-food supply chains and its transition to the circular economy.","Anastasiadis F., Manikas I., Apostolidou I., Wahbeh S.",The role of traceability in end-to-end circular agri-food supply chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129484942&doi=10.1016%2fj.indmarman.2022.04.021&partnerID=40&md5=3fd10408ab4cb73fce134bed2f355064
"Sustainable Production, Life Cycle Engineering and Management","The transition towards a Circular Economy is a topic of great concern for the textile and fashion industry, since such industry is one of the main polluting in the world. Although Circular Economy is now on the rise in the academia and on the policy agendas, this model is still underdeveloped in practice. Unlike polyester, wool has long been compatible with recycling processes, thus reducing environmental impact and contributing to closing the loop in a Circular Economy. In this context, the industrial district of Prato (Italy) has successfully established a woollen industry based on recycled wool since centuries. Thus, this paper presents three case studies of companies operating in the Prato district, to explore challenges and opportunities of Circular Economy in the textile industry.

Soft Computing,"The transport industry is one of the main contributors to environmental pollution. Assessing the efficiency of this industry helps organizations to enhance their awareness of performance and develop managerial strategies. The need for sustainable development in the transportation industry requires efficiency analysis. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a popular approach for efficiency evaluation. Traditional DEA assumes that the dataset should be crisp. However, in real-world problems, there might be imprecise data. On the other hand, the network DEA (NDEA) measures the efficiency of multistage processes. The NDEA models deal with the internal structure of decision-making units (DMUs). This study offers a novel analysis and contribution to the knowledge of efficiency evaluation by (1) proposing a novel robust two-stage NDEA (RTNDEA) model to evaluate the sustainability of supply chains and (2) dealing with undesirable outputs and uncertain conditions for efficiency analysis.

The mass-market retail sector plays an important role in this context. Notwithstanding growing attention towards sustainability, calculations of the carbon footprint and related mitigation actions in this sector are mainly carried out with reference only to the premises of the company, i.e., accounting for direct emissions from its facilities, while very little is known and done about the emissions caused by logistics and transport activities along the supply chain. This paper fills a gap in the literature, by presenting a case study of tank-to-wheel carbon emissions of a small-medium retail cooperative company located in the Campania region. The company's entire yearly transport attracted and generated has been reconstructed using company data and direct observations of warehouses, distribution centres, and stores. Interestingly, customers of retail stores have also been investigated to calculate their overall carbon footprint. Tank-to-wheel emissions were calculated using COPERT software. The analysis reveals interesting prospects for the carbon footprint of the retail sector and suggests a number of complementary actions to be implemented to make freight transport operations in the sector more sustainable.","Romano A., Tocchi D., Tinessa F., Marzano V., Simonelli F.",Analysis of the carbon footprint of freight transport in the mass market retail sector: a case study in Campania (Italy),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137989032&doi=10.1109%2fEEEIC%2fICPSEurope54979.2022.9854699&partnerID=40&md5=a559b2b000c3fa587159e06f1e87ca14
Sustainable Development,"The transportation sector has a strong negative impact on the environment and therefore requires new sustainable development measures. This paper proposes a new indicator of sustainability in transport obtained through a multi-criteria analysis based on Eurostat data and a panel of 10 academics. The results show a positive performance of Sweden in the period 2015–2019 and a small number of countries above the European average. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis based on these experts identifies the critical success factors associated with purchasing electric vehicles. The greatest importance is assigned to purchase cost, followed by battery autonomy. Our analysis proposes that electric vehicles are unable to achieve a sustainable transition unless three conditions are met: (i) use of renewable sources, (ii) local industrial development of the sector, and (iii) battery recycling. Therefore, Europe urgently needs to realize new industrial activities and avoid social unsustainability.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"The tremendous urbanization pace of India calls for higher efficiency in housing development, currently typified by low productivity and poor sustainability performance. Although off-site construction (OSC) is a method of widely acknowledged efficiency, its current uptake in India is very low, and the factors hindering its wider adaptation have not been comprehensively researched. This paper employs interviews with experts, a questionnaire survey and the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) technique to achieve the following objectives: first, to reveal which factors are perceived as top barriers for OSC implementation in India; second, to develop a hierarchical model presenting the causality between these factors; and third, to propose the initiatives required for barriers with high impact on other barriers to be most efficiently tackled. The survey findings show that the barriers perceived as most important from the professionals’ point of view are design inflexibility, difficulties in storage and transportation, supply chain weaknesses, initial capital requirements and lack of skills. The ISM reveals, though, that the underlying causes for these barriers lie with factors such as public procurement regulations and the fragmentation of the sector.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"The tropical fruit sector plays a crucial role in global agriculture due to its growth and contribution to food security. However, this sector has been identified as the source of several environmental externalities, attracting researchers, policy-makers and sectoral actors to promote alternative practices within food systems that would aid in moving towards sustainability according to Agenda 2030) of the United Nations. Central America and the Caribbean Region is among the leading fruit producers, and pineapple is the second most-consumed tropical fruit globally, with the Dominican Republic as the fourth largest producer in the region. This work aims to test with policy-makers how the Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) approach applied to the pineapple production of the Dominican Republic could be integrated into policy decision tools. It began with a context analysis focused on the country's agriculture, stakeholders, and policy setting. Then a Life Cycle Assessment and Environmental Life Cycle Costing were performed to evaluate the sustainability of agri-food products. Data collection was carried out in two groups of farms. The functional unit was the serving of fruit per hectare with system boundaries from cradle-to-gate, including land preparation, production, and harvesting up to the gate of the farm. The environmental analysis entailed impact categories, such as climate change, freshwater eutrophication, human toxicity and fossil resource scarcity, while the costing analysis included the US dollars spent to produce a serving of pineapple. Finally, a two-stage Delphi was applied to obtain the view of experts in regards to the use of LCT in the policies of this productive sector. The results showed that the main environmental and cost hotspots were located at the production stage, primarily due to the use of fertilizers. Consulted experts considered LCT was useful as input for monitoring, addressing hotspots and guiding decision-making processes for the sustainability of the sector; hence it would be an asset if integrated into policy decision tools. The integration of methods for this analysis represents an innovative approach for the study and policy-making of agri-food products as pineapple, with the utmost purpose of reaching improved sustainability within the supply chain of agri-food products in similar conditions as the ones present in the studied case.","García-Herrero L., Brenes-Peralta L., Leschi F., Vittuari M.",Integrating Life Cycle Thinking in a policy decision tool: Its application in the pineapple production in Dominican Republic,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130330523&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.132094&partnerID=40&md5=377a693bc3d22014160b6a37581a2053
Transportation Research Record,"The U.S. maritime transportation system is a foundational element of the national supply chain, and its operators are under immense pressure to ensure that its ports can reliably and efficiently support supply chain demands despite their exposure to potential disruptions. Understanding the connectivity of these ports is critical to describing the robustness of port network regions in the face of disruption. In this work, Marine Cadastre Automatic Identification System data are utilized to describe a network of 62 interconnected ports (‘‘nodes’’) within the U.S. maritime transportation system. This network is analyzed with community detection via label propagation to quantitatively identify regions of the U.S. port network based on shared vessel traffic and examined with the PageRank algorithm to identify ports that are critical to regional traffic flow. The detected communities of the U.S. port network were driven by physical proximity in many instances. However, the Mississippi River and Gulf ports were split based on the predominant vessel type of each port. Additionally, ports along the Gulf often received lower PageRank scores than West coast ports of similar size.

Newly available resources and emerging technologies spurred research focused on new pathways and technologies for producing chemicals. The adoption and deployment of these technologies by the manufacturing industry is driven by the need to minimize costs while meeting demand for chemical products. However, cost minimization is a unilateral objective that may conflict with other societal, environmental or economic goals and constraints. Motivated by this, in this paper we study the optimal configuration of the U.S. petrochemicals industry by considering both economic and environmental objectives.

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"The unavoidable negative effects of global warming have been a key if not the most important issue occupying policy makers in the world at large today. The much talked about green economy nowadays seeks to achieve sustainable economic growth and development without compromising environmental quality. The relationship between environmental degradation and economic growth is largely explained by the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. By employing the basic postulation of the baseline EKC framework, this study proposes and tests the existence of a dualistic approach of the EKC hypothesis. Geometry is used to illustrate the proposed dualistic model. Meanwhile, the novel dynamic common correlation effect econometric technique is employed to test the existence of the dualistic EKC within a panel of 109 countries from 1995 to 2016. The outcome from the estimated models shows that, in the global sample, the existence of the dualistic U-shaped and N-shaped EKC hypothesis is validated. When the sample is split into subsamples based on income levels, the U-shaped EKC hypothesis is validated for lower-income and high-income economies meanwhile, the N-shaped dualistic EKC is mostly associated with high-income economies.","Dinga G.D., Fonchamnyo D.C., Achuo E.D.",Primal–dual approach to environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis: A demand and supply side analyses of environmental degradation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117000494&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-021-16821-y&partnerID=40&md5=e82d3980896d68ab1ea2b00bd80fe626

Applied Energy,"The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 held in 2021 concluded a global effort to hasten the energy transition toward a net-zero emission industry. As such, green initiatives, which transition the conventional oil and gas (O&G) sector towards a circular economy (CE) are necessary. In this work, the integration of waste oil re-refining technology is proposed as a potential strategy to enhance the circularity of the O&G industry. A two-step sequential model, which incorporates multiple systematic analytical tools (e.g., multi-objective decision analysis, information entropy, geospatial information, clustering, and routing analysis) is developed to determine: (i) optimal waste oil re-refinery technologies, and (ii) optimal supply chain design, which addresses the location for setting up the process facilities and the delivery routes, with the consideration of both economic and environmental performances. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through a case study in Malaysia (that covers both East and West Malaysia). The analysis showed that the proposed strategy is capable of improving economic and environmental performances by about 9.59% and 46.55%, respectively.

Furthermore, the inter-and intra-sectoral energy linkages are understudied. This study quantifies China’s FFEDS, the world’s largest energy consumer. According to the findings, the highest levels of coal, natural gas, and petroleum consumption (CNGPC) are embedded in the construction sector’s input demand. “Electricity and steam production and supply” total intermediate exports (internal plus inter-sectoral) stimulated the highest coal consumption. “Crude petroleum products and natural gas products” and “railway freight transport” aggregate supplies induced the highest volume of natural gas and petroleum consumption. Compared to intra-sectoral demand, inter-sectoral demand stimulated significantly larger CNGPCs. In contrast, CNGPC’s inter-and inter-sectoral supplies were nearly identical.

Frontiers in Energy Research,"The University of Tennessee’s (UT) Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics models supply chains for both liquid and electricity generating technologies currently in use and/or forthcoming for the bio/renewable energy industry using the input–output model IMPLAN®. The approach for ethanol, biodiesel, and other liquid fuels includes the establishment and production of the feedstock, transportation of the feedstock to the plant gate, and the one-time investment as well as annual operating of the facility that converts the feedstock to a biofuel. This modeling approach may also include the preprocessing and storage of feedstocks at depots. Labor/salary requirements and renewable identification number (RIN) values and credits attributable to the conversion facility, along with land-use changes for growing the feedstock are also included in the supply chain analyses. The investment and annual operating of renewable energy technologies for electricity generation for wind, solar, and digesters are modeled as well. Recent modeling emphasis has centered on the supply chain for liquid fuels using the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s 179 economic trading areas as modeling regions. These various data layers necessary to estimate the economic impact are contained in UT’s renewable energy economic analysis layers (REEAL) modeling system.

The conversion technology modeled is a gasification Fischer–Tropsch biorefinery with feedstock input of 495,000 metric tons per year of forest residue transported to a logging road that is less than one mile in distance. The biorefinery is expected to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), diesel, and naphtha. An estimated one million tons of forest residue are required at fifty percent moisture content. Based on a technical economic assessment (TEA) developed by the Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT) and the quantity of hardwood residues available in the Central Appalachian region, three biorefineries could be sited each utilizing 495,000 dry metric tons per year. Each biorefinery could produce 47.5 million liters of SAF, 40.3 million liters of diesel, and 23.6 million liters of naphtha. Annual gross revenues for fuel required for the biorefineries to break even are estimated at $193.7 million per biorefinery. Break-even plant gate fuel prices when assuming RINs and 12.2 percent return on investment are $1.12 per liter for SAF, $1.15 per liter for diesel, and $0.97 per liter for naphtha. Based on IMPLAN, an input–output model, and an investment of $1.7 billion, the estimated economic annual impact to the Central Appalachian region if the three biorefineries are sited is over a half a billion dollars. Leakages occur as investment dollars leaving the region based on the regions local purchase coefficients (i.e., LPPs), which totals $500 million. This results in an estimated $2.67 billion in economic activity with a multiplier of 1.7, or for every million dollars spent, an additional $0.7 million in economic activity is generated in the regional economy. Gross regional product is estimated at $1.28 billion and employment of nearly 1,200 jobs are created during the construction period of the biorefineries, which results in $700 million in labor income with multiplier effects. Economic activity for the feedstock operations (harvesting and chipping) is estimated at slightly more than $16.8 million resulting in an additional $30 million in the economic impact. The stumpage and additional profit occurring from the harvest of the forest residues result in $40 million directly into the pockets of the resource and logging operation owners. Their subsequent expenditures resulted in a total economic activity increase of $71.4 million. These operations result in creating an estimated 103 direct jobs for a total of 195 with multiplier effects. Direct feedstock transportation expenditures of more than $36.7 million provide an estimated increase in economic activity of almost $68 million accounting for the multiplier effects.

International Journal of Production Economics,"The UN's sustainable development goals underscore engaging supply-chain stakeholders with environmentally friendly practices. Small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) are key participants in several supply chains, but their operations often produce a significant environmental impact. Their transition to sustainable practices is challenging because they operate with constrained resources, which are mostly invested in pressing activities. Therefore, evidence is needed that shows the benefits of investing limited resources in sustainable activities to support decision-making in SMEs. Research has neglected to connect circular economy and sustainable-oriented innovation whilst accounting for external factors affecting the implementation of sustainable processes and technology within SMEs in developing countries. This paper fills that gap by analyzing the impact of external factors on the implementation of circular economy and technology, and their influence on sustainable-oriented innovation and sustainable performance. Responses from 165 Mexican SMEs have been collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling to test direct and indirect effects between constructs. Findings reveal that while both governmental support and customer pressure facilitate the adoption of circular economy, only governmental support contributes directly to technology implementation. They also highlight the value of circular economy to support the adoption of sustainable-oriented innovation and to mediate the relationship between technology implementation and sustainable-oriented innovation. The overarching finding is that circular economy promoting sustainability-oriented innovation has a positive impact on financial, environmental, and social performance. This is a key implication to inform managers in SMEs on the potential benefits of investing in sustainable solutions.","Rodríguez-Espíndola O., Cuevas-Romo A., Chowdhury S., Díaz-Acevedo N., Albores P., Despoudi S., Malesios C., Dey P.","The role of circular economy principles and sustainable-oriented innovation to enhance social, economic and environmental performance: Evidence from Mexican SMEs",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127164700&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108495&partnerID=40&md5=a2857407bf35008737069eec2216d723

Aquaculture,"The use of imported versus domestic trout eggs has been a major challenge for trout farming in Iran. Imported trout species have a lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) which reduces the feeding costs of such trout, compared to Iranian trout. There is also an import subsidy on foreign eggs, which are imported exclusively by private firms in Iran. Despite the subsidy, the average cost for an imported egg is more than a domestic egg. Foreign eggs have become an essential input for Iranian hatcheries, but some propagation farms cannot obtain them because of sanctions. These import problems are a threat to food security and farm production of fish. Therefore, the true cost of using imported eggs is unknown. The present study investigates the economic costs of the import subsidy on the trout supply chain. The concept of ‘economic efficiency’ was employed in an analysis of the trout supply chain in Mazandaran Province, one of Iran's largest trout farming centers. Data were collected from five supply chains in the province, a dependent supply chain of domestic and imported trout egg users and four independent supply chains of domestic trout egg users. Network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) was employed to analyze the data. The findings revealed that the identified chains were near the maximum use of their inputs; hence, they were documented to be technically efficient. However, allocative efficiency was the main distractive factor in the chains. Thus, the independent chains had higher economic efficiency than the dependent chain. Allocative efficiency in the independent chains arose from vertical integration (forward and backward in the supply of trout eggs). The government should consider replacing the subsidy on imported eggs with financial assistance to improve technology in hatchery and propagation farms in Mazandaran. Moreover, the reduction of feed prices and wages along with vertical integration in the supply chain of domestic trout eggs was identified and analyzed as another solution to ensure economic efficiency and sustainable food security.","Asadikia H., Mosavi S.H., Reed M.R., Khalilian S., Alamdarlo H.N.",The dilemma between imported versus domestic trout egg: Roles of vertical integration and input prices,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126864425&doi=10.1016%2fj.aquaculture.2022.738131&partnerID=40&md5=88be55ffcebf87bda8122feb8ae11030
Mechanisms and Machine Science,"The use of stainless steel has been increasing in sectors where mechanical wear acts in conjunction with corrosion, such as mining and agribusiness, particularly biofuels. This replacement has led to an increase in the service life and a reduction in the weight of the structures, significantly improving the sustainability of these sectors. When using materials having a longer functional life, the production chain is more environmentally friendly because less coke and less iron ore are needed. In the case of green steels, i.e., steel produced with charcoal instead of coke and entirely recyclable, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is even more favourable. Due to the unique supply chain, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, Aperam South America is the only global producer of steels that uses 100% charcoal from proprietary eucalyptus forests instead of mineral coke. Laboratory and field tests were performed that compared abrasion-corrosion of carbon steels, advanced high-strength steels, weathering steel and nine different green stainless steels. Initially, rubber wheel and free-ball microabrasion tests were performed. In addition, a laboratory device approaching actual service conditions was built. In the field, samples were placed in sand processing equipment and inside a concrete mixer drum in a truck. Both the field and laboratory samples were collected and extensively analysed using SEM and hardness tests. Finally, a complete green stainless-steel concrete mixer drum entirely manufactured from green 410M steel was built, adapted to a truck and field-tested for five years (beginning in 2015). The useful life of the equipment increased up to three times compared to that made with standard carbon steel. It is worth noting that the concrete mixer made of green steel still preserves 70% of its thickness, predicting production of 72,000 m3 of concrete and work for 12 years without the need for maintenance, which makes it the most sustainable, advanced, and cost-effective solution for the concrete mixer drum.","Labiapari W.S., Costa R.J.G., de Alcântara C.M., Pagani V., Di Cunto J.C., de Mello J.D.B.","Green Ferritic Stainless Steel: A Sustainable, Advanced and Cost-Effective Solution for the Concrete Mixer Drum",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118167634&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-87383-7_47&partnerID=40&md5=5018066388ffbcf4c2582d1f84cc4d67
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The values associated with food are framed and constructed by market-based systems that assign attributes to different foods across the marketplace. The aim of the paper was to conceptual-ize the range of non-financial aspects associated with food in the literature examined and a typology was introduced to position a new set of non-financial food values, the alter-values, which support the creation of a more holistic approach to visualize and reimagine a more sustainable, resilient food system that readdresses and respects such values. The four alter-values of interest, intrinsic, pro-duction-related, supply chain related, and emotio-cultural values, were discussed in the context of changing food environments, and a visualization of the typology was presented to explain them. By focusing especially on intrinsic and emotio-cultural values, an adaptation of the current food environment beyond pecuniary-based emphasis was possible. Such an approach helps to challenge the structure of the conventional food system towards a more citizen-driven sustainable model, altering priorities, with a drive towards embedding values and going beyond perceiving food only in terms of exchange value, to considering food as a vital aspect of life.","Lingham S., Manning L., Maye D.",Reimagining Food: Readdressing and Respecting Values,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132710455&doi=10.3390%2fsu14127328&partnerID=40&md5=8ddcb2c18b0a23f70a9085e148965d03
Journal of Cleaner Production,"The vanilla supply chain is characterized by high risk crop management and unstable supply. In order to meet global vanilla demand while improving production sustainability, new approaches considering agro-ecological cultivation systems and transparent supply chain management are needed. In this study, we aim to understand farmers’ preferences towards such alternative vanilla cultivation and marketing systems, and thereby inform the development of a more sustainable vanilla supply chain. We implemented a discrete choice experiment and a survey with 186 farmers in the Península de Osa, southern Costa Rica, and estimated mixed logit and latent class models. We find that surveyed farmers are in general positive about vanilla cultivation and prefer an agroforestry system over vanilla cultivation in forests, crop wild relatives over commercial species, and manual pollination over natural pollination. Farmers prefer to sell green rather than cured vanilla beans, and like to engage in cooperatives that provide training and production contracts with buyers. Preferences are found to differ across farmers and we identify four preference classes. The preference class with the largest average probability (44%) shows the strongest preferences for agro-ecological vanilla cultivation in diversified agroforestry systems, using crop wild relatives and natural pollinators. Furthermore, this class has the highest likelihood to live in areas with restricted land use policies, creating opportunities for the development of more sustainable vanilla cultivation systems conform with the national program of landscape connectivity and biodiversity conservation. We propose a two-tier approach in alignment with observed farmer preferences and with potential for upscaling to similar areas along the Neotropics.","Watteyn C., Dejonghe O., Van Hoyweghen K., Azofeifa Bolaños J.B., Karremans A.P., Vranken L., Reubens B., Muys B., Maertens M.",Exploring farmer preferences towards innovations in the vanilla supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120342650&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2021.129831&partnerID=40&md5=ef00d08cf9075421962d39dddfb33a57
Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"The viable closed-loop supply chain network (VCLSCND) is a new concept that integrates sustainability, resiliency, and agility into a circular economy.

This form considers robustness against demand disruption. Finally, CLSC components are located, and quantity flows are determined in the automotive industry. The results show that the VCLSCND cost is less than not considering viability and has a − 0.44% gap. We analyze essential parameters. By increasing the conservative coefficient, confidence level, and the scale of the main model, decreasing the allowed maximum energy, the cost function, time solution, and energy consumption grow. We suggested applying the Fix-and-Optimize algorithm for producing an upper bound for large-scale.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"The Water footprint (WF) is an indicator of the amount of direct and indirect freshwater used to make a product available, measured over its entire supply chain. Dairy cows are cooled using sprinklers and fans to mitigate heat stress (HS) in summer. Although several studies have already evaluated cows’ milk WF, little information is available on the impact of water sprayed to cool cows on milk WF and fans related energy consumption. The study enrolled six Holstein-Friesian farms equipped with cooling systems, including sprinklers and fans. Based on the volume of water sprayed to cool cows, farms were classified as Low User Spraying Water (Low-USW) and Large-User Spraying Water (Large- USW). For each farm, an alternative no-cooling scenario was modelled considering the water and energy saved, the increment of the drinking water needed from no-cooled cows, and the reduction of milk yield caused by HS. The mean annual WF of the farms involved in the study accounted for 805 ± 225 L water per kg of Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM) with the following distribution among the green, blue and grey fractions: 67.9%, 21.1%, and 11%, respectively. Cooling operations had a low incidence (0.04%) on the overall milk WF, which was 1.1% lower (8.6 L water kg−1 FPCM−1) than that modelled for the alternative no-cooling scenarios. Although both investigated cooling protocols (Large vs Low) showed a similar capacity to contain milk losses during summer, the study has highlighted differences in their resource use. Compared to the Large-USW, the Low-USW cooling management reduces water use by about 0.4 L water kg−1 FPCM−1 and increases energy consumption by about 0.13 kWh kg−1 FPCM−1. Cooling systems help farmers to mitigate HS in dairy cows during summer. The extra water needed for cooling is compensated by the effects of cooling in limiting the HS-related decline in milk yield. Therefore, the water used to cool cattle does not impact milk's WF. However, further research is needed to find the best solution for sprinklers and fans utilization, optimizing the preservation of animal welfare and environmental sustainability of milk production under climate change scenarios.","Grossi G., Vitali A., Lacetera N.",Impact of summer cooling management on milk water footprint in dairy cows,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133833409&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.133062&partnerID=40&md5=1d9bc7e318c50243403753e8f485706f
Annual Review of Food Science and Technology,"The world food supply depends on a diminishing list of plant crops and animal livestock to not only feed the ever-growing human population but also improve its nutritional state and lower the disease burden. Over the past century or so, technological advances in agricultural and food processing have helped reduce hunger and poverty but have not adequately addressed sustainability targets. This has led to an erosion of agricultural biodiversity and balanced diets and contributed to climate change and rising rates of chronic metabolic diseases. Modern food supply chains have progressively lost dietary fiber, complex carbohydrates, micronutrients, and several classes of phytochemicals with high bioactivity and nutritional relevance.

Environmental Science and Technology,"The world is not on track to meet Sustainable Development Goal 6.1 to provide universal access to safely managed drinking water by 2030. Removal of priority microbial contaminants by disinfection is one aspect of ensuring water is safely managed. Passive chlorination (also called in-line chlorination) represents one approach to disinfecting drinking water before or at the point of collection (POC), without requiring daily user input or electricity. In contrast to manual household chlorination methods typically implemented at the point of use (POU), passive chlorinators can reduce the user burden for chlorine dosing and enable treatment at scales ranging from communities to small municipalities. In this review, we synthesized evidence from 27 evaluations of passive chlorinators (in 19 articles, 3 NGO reports, and 5 theses) conducted across 16 countries in communities, schools, health care facilities, and refugee camps. Of the 27 passive chlorinators we identified, the majority (22/27) were solid tablet or granular chlorine dosers, and the remaining devices were liquid chlorine dosers. We identified the following research priorities to address existing barriers to scaled deployment of passive chlorinators: (i) strengthening local chlorine supply chains through decentralized liquid chlorine production, (ii) validating context-specific business models and financial sustainability, (iii) leveraging remote monitoring and sensing tools to monitor real-time chlorine levels and potential system failures, and (iv) designing handpump-compatible passive chlorinators to serve the many communities reliant on handpumps as a primary drinking water source. We also propose a set of reporting indicators for future studies to facilitate standardized evaluations of the technical performance and financial sustainability of passive chlorinators. In addition, we discuss the limitations of chlorine-based disinfection and recognize the importance of addressing chemical contamination in drinking water supplies. Passive chlorinators deployed and managed at-scale have the potential to elevate the quality of existing accessible and available water services to meet ""safely managed""requirements.","Lindmark M., Cherukumilli K., Crider Y.S., Marcenac P., Lozier M., Voth-Gaeddert L., Lantagne D.S., Mihelcic J.R., Zhang Q.M., Just C., Pickering A.J.",Passive In-Line Chlorination for Drinking Water Disinfection: A Critical Review,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134083295&doi=10.1021%2facs.est.1c08580&partnerID=40&md5=fbdc8b55b0cf7a98bef2dbd67112038f
Sustainability (Switzerland),"The world’s population is expected to grow at an increasing rate, leading to increased food consumption and waste production. Even though food waste represents one of the most challenging economic and environmental issues of the 21st century, it also provides a vast array of valuable resources. To address the challenge, this study uses resource recovery from food waste to close the supply chain loop, which is the cornerstone of a circular economy. By applying the bibliometric review technique, trends and patterns in food waste and circular economy were studied. The analysis of frequent keywords in the field provided insights into further research directions. A Boolean search of the keywords in the Scopus database resulted in 288 articles, published between 2015 and 2021. Further screening of titles, keywords, and abstracts resulted in 155 journal articles. Bibliometric coupling, including authors’ co-citation data, co-occurrence, and the occurrence of keywords, was graphically mapped using VOSviewer software. From the analysis of the publications, eight broad themes emerged: (1) anaerobic digestion of food waste for circular economy creation; (2) food waste systems and life cycle assessments for circular economy; (3) bio-based circular economy approaches; (4) consumer behavior and attitudes toward circular economies; (5) food supply chains and food waste in a circular economy; (6) material flow analysis and sustainability; (7) challenges, policies, and practices to achieve circularity; and (8) circular economy and patterns of consumption. Based on the eight themes, we emphasize an urgent need to promote the collaboration of governments, the private sector, educational institutions, and researchers, who should combine efforts to promote, integrate and accelerate acceptance of circularity, which will potentially mitigate greenhouse emissions associated with food loss and waste. We also highlight an opportunity to encourage consumer acceptance of upcycled food in the food waste hierarchy. In addition, we deduce that there is a need to quantify food waste and emissions of greenhouse gases due to this waste along the food value chain; this is important as it is one pathway of examining the ‘food leaks’ along the food supply chain. This can then inform optimal strategies targeting specific areas of the food supply chain experiencing food leaks.

Energy for Sustainable Development,"There are currently several studies about the necessity of increasing access to sustainable electricity for isolated communities or in remote areas using alternative energy sources. There are about 212 energy grid isolated systems in Brazil, mainly concentrated in the North of the country, especially in the state of Amazonas, largely supplied by diesel power plants. The isolated systems in Amazonas present significant logistical challenges due primarily to the dependence on fluvial transport. The small-scale liquefied natural gas by fluvial transport can be an alternative to natural gas supply to remote areas and isolated systems and the non-dependence or construction of new pipelines. Based on this context, the work aims to evaluate the small-scale liquefied natural gas economic costs by fluvial transport to replace diesel oil with natural gas in power plants in the state of Amazonas. It then also analyses whether this substitution can significantly mitigate greenhouse gas emissions of the electricity sector at the local level. As a result, the use of natural gas in just a few scenarios elaborated from the case studies can provide energy security, decrease local emissions of CO2eq, and reduce the electricity cost to the final consumer.","Peyerl D., da Silveira Cachola C., Alves V.H., Mondragon M., Macedo S.F., Guichet X., dos Santos E.M.","Applying small-scale liquefied natural gas supply chain by fluvial transport in the isolated systems: The case study of Amazonas, Brazil",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127714178&doi=10.1016%2fj.esd.2022.03.010&partnerID=40&md5=71c8ea4079f92d8080c1e76d8b2709d9

Through numerical simulation, we find that (1) the seller can always benefit from capacity sharing even when the match fails, while the buyer benefits from capacity sharing only when the capacity constraint is relatively severe; (2) both the buyer and seller prefer to participate through the platform when the platform has a sufficiently high advantage in matching success rates; (3) if the capacity constraint is much severe, the capacity buyer may turn to self-match rather than capacity sharing. Besides, we also study the sustainability of the capacity-sharing system and show how the platform can improve sustainability by forgoing accumulated profits.","Ma J., Xie L.",Analysis on Capacity Sharing with Failed Match Based on the Evolutionary Game Theory,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131721353&doi=10.1142%2fS0218127422500857&partnerID=40&md5=69c8c9711ea83f50ff3f67655235fc4c
Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space,"There is an ambivalence within political ecology about whether the unequal power relations that emerge from many development projects are intended or unintended. This ambivalence is a result of an empirical focus on the effects of these programs on target communities, as opposed to an empirical focus on the people who are responsible for developing those programs. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork among people tasked with designing, promoting, and enforcing sustainability standards in global agricultural supply chains, I argue that the empowerment of multinational corporations and well-funded environmental NGOs that characterizes market-oriented sustainability programs is, in fact, intentional. This intention reflects the belief among sustainability professionals that the intersection of western scientific expertise with the dynamics of “the market” is the most effective way to promote sustainability in global supply chains, and to generate global sustainability in a more general sense. Concepts like “stakeholder engagement” and a commitment to flexibility and accommodation in the development and adoption of social and environmental standards are examples of what I call euphemistic sustainability, which shifts critical attention away from a balance of power that is increasingly tilted toward private interests, even as that imbalance remains an intended outcome of non-state market-driven governance systems like ostensibly voluntary sustainability standards.",Archer M.,"How to govern a sustainable supply chain: Standards, standardizers, and the political ecology of (in)advertence",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113639707&doi=10.1177%2f25148486211014505&partnerID=40&md5=5ae6f863f4eb8f73f6378d9ba13a44d5
Sustainable Production and Consumption,"There is an urgent need to address social issues in global supply chains. Voluntary certification schemes for green products face major technical, methodological, and institutional challenges when it comes to integrating reliable and verifiable product criteria on social and human rights aspects. The main focus of eco-labels, such as the German Blue Angel, has largely been on addressing the environmental and health-related aspects of products and services. There is a continuous uncertainty about what consumers expect from well-established eco-labels, such as the Blue Angel, and how manufacturers and license holders would react to the proposition of including social criteria. Therefore, in 2018, the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) commissioned the project “Extended integration of social aspects in the Blue Angel eco-label” to analyse the expectations and interests of consumers and enterprises regarding the integration of social criteria in the Blue Angel label. The applied approach involved two primary data collections, a manufacturer, and a consumer survey. Both surveys collected insights into the opinions and preferences of manufacturers and consumers regarding the integration of social criteria into the requirements of the Blue Angel scheme. The survey also collected information on product groups that were perceived to be most relevant as well as on expectations with respect to specific social issues. One key result is that generally consumers and manufacturers have a strong interest in integrating social criteria in the Blue Angel scheme. This reflects the societal consensus that social and human rights issues should be an integral part of sustainability certification schemes and the supply chain management of enterprises.","Rubik F., Prakash S., Riedel F.",Integration of social aspects in the German Blue Angel scheme – Views from manufacturers and consumers,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135196855&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.07.018&partnerID=40&md5=b0817da4e5149e0ade0f3af2300ded20
Sustainability (Switzerland),"There is growing recognition that sustainable innovation is not necessarily about new technologies, but about new or adapted organisational models, behaviours, and networks. How people engage in or with innovation is driven by values, but values differ across actor categories in agri-food value-chains. Understanding actors’ values helps us to identify potential for collaborative innovation within agri-food value-chains, and to address potential barriers and obstacles. In the context of the Ploutos H2020 project, we conducted participatory focus group (FG) sessions at the EU level involving actors across the value-chain to brainstorm values, enablers, and hindrances in the process of sustainability-oriented innovation. Participants co-created stories showing scenarios within sustainability-oriented innovation where conflicts could occur between values and others where mutual values were created by multi-actor alliances. Based on a qualitative description of the data collected in these FGs, we identify a range of cultural and social values in decision-making and innovation processes, creating dilemmas and trade-offs, but also opportunities for sustainability-oriented innovation. A strong ecosystem of collaboration across the value-chain, based on relationships of shared interests and trust, is fundamental to innovation. We provide detailed insights regarding the use of participatory approaches to working with innovation actors to increase awareness of diversity in value systems and how it can be negotiated.

Chemical Engineering Transactions,"There is utmost urgency to decarbonize the various industry sectors to keep the global temperature increase within adaptable levels. The P-graph framework is a tool that can support the network design and optimization of new and integrated decarbonization and carbon management systems. An advantage of the P-graph is the capability to determine optimal and near-optimal network solutions that aid decision-making. P-graph is commonly applied in planning supply chain networks and designing reaction pathways and mechanisms but can also be used in designing and optimizing systems to reduce carbon emissions. This work surveys the P-graph literature on decarbonization and Carbon Management Networks (CMNs). Bibliometric analysis is used to identify the trends, knowledge gaps, and potential future research areas. P-graph studies related to biomass and renewable energy are dominant research areas in this sub-area of study. Emerging topics include bio-hydrogen renewable energy, Negative Emissions Technologies (NETs), and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Trend analysis suggests that P-graph approaches to biorefineries, product design, uncertainty, and risk analysis will continue to grow. Other combined techniques with P-graph such as the use of sustainability indicators, reliability and criticality analysis, multi-criterion decision analysis (MCDA), Life Cycle Optimization (LCO), and Monte Carlo simulation extend the capabilities of P-graph.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"There is widespread recognition that a transformation of food systems is needed to improve environmental sustainability. As part of efforts to hold food companies accountable for their role in improving the environmental sustainability of food systems, there is a critical role for monitoring and benchmarking of company actions. This study aimed to develop a proposed set of metrics for assessing the commitments and practices of food companies regarding environmental sustainability. Guided by an inventory of existing sustainability reporting frameworks and benchmarking initiatives, we proposed 37 indicators for assessment, categorised into ten domains, covering strategy, packaging, greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, water, biodiversity, food waste, compliance and reducing animal-sourced foods. We refined the indicators after consultation with academic experts. We discussed implementation feasibility with sustainability managers from three major food companies in New Zealand. Feedback highlighted the need to pilot test methods for applying the indicators in practice, including assessment of a company’s impact across the supply chain, refining indicator scoring criteria, and weighting indicators based on company- and sector-specific priority areas of focus. Assessment of food companies using the proposed set of metrics can improve accountability for action and inform government regulatory responses.","Mackay S., Renker-Darby A., Robinson E., Shaw G., Sacks G.",Development of a Proposed Set of Indicators for Assessing Food Company Commitments and Practices Regarding Environmental Sustainability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137723763&doi=10.3390%2fsu141610315&partnerID=40&md5=5fcd9659ccc7302a56e24a3344d59ce4
Annals of Operations Research,"These two main objectives of this study are to present a theoretical model to explain how business intelligence capabilities influence the company’s supply chain sustainability and to examine the relationships among different BI and CSCS dimensions. This study was conducted with the use of a standard BI questionnaire along with the United Nations CSCS questionnaire among 234 Iranian pharmaceutical companies, from which 188 were also surveyed. Smart pls3 and partial least squares methods were used for validity as well as reliability evaluation of the measurement model. According to the findings, BI significantly affects the sustainability of the pharmaceutical supply chain and some of its dimensions, including vision, scope, and internal aspects, thereby the hypothesis indicating the effect of BI on these dimensions was accepted. However, there was an insignificantly positive relationship between BI and the other dimensions of CSCS, including expectation, engagement, and goals; hence, the hypothesis indicating the effect of BI on these dimensions was rejected. If the policy of the board is to implement supply chain sustainability, BI can have a greater impact on the company. Otherwise, BI may be implemented with not much effect though it can be indirectly beneficial to these companies. No studies have been performed on direct examination of the relationship of BI and CSCS and their various dimensions with the use of an extensive survey among Iran’s pharmaceutical companies. Also, this study reveals some facts about the sustainability of the pharmaceutical supply chain, BI, and relevant issues as significant obstacles against a sustainable supply chain and BI.

Ecological Economics,"Third party certified food labelling schemes can be used to reduce asymmetric information in anonymous markets. However, in short food supply chains (SFSCs) trust linkages can be also built through direct contact between consumers and producers. This paper analyzes which type of local producers are interested in these officially recognized certifications, inferring the role that third party certified labelling schemes can play for SFSCs in the Region of Madrid (RofM). For this purpose, 71 producers were surveyed in 2018. We studied their interest in third party certifications, what food attributes they offer to consumers and their perceptions about SFSCs. Producers without interest in third party certifications not only offer direct product attributes but also inform about production methods and their characteristics as producers. Furthermore, these producers have more social and environmental ethical concerns for conventional chains, recognizing SFSCs as solutions with social, economic and environmental benefits. The findings of our study suggest that policies that promote or require existing officially recognized certifications in SFSCs may limit the participation of these committed producers. Therefore, third party certifications may not be the best strategy to support these producers in fostering a transition towards a more sustainable local food system in the RofM.","González-Azcárate M., Cruz-Maceín J.L., Bardají I.",Certifications in short food supply chains in the region of Madrid.

First, the proposed decision-support framework enables companies to define the appropriate boundaries for carbon emission measurement and abatement and identify the relevant optimisation problem. Second, this framework describes options for optimising the level of abatement effort linked to each selected action. Third, an application of the framework to the Eastman Chemical Company reveals several real-world implications, including recommendations for where to exert carbon abatement efforts in a supply chain.

The analysis shows that the sustainability performance increases significantly with a supplier's headcount. Furthermore, it shows that manufacturing suppliers perform significantly better compared to service providers.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"This article analyses how a strategy for Tanzania’s tanzanite gemstone mining sector could foster gender equality in the mine-to-market (M2M) supply chain, whilst enhancing opportunities for female entrepreneurship as part of the country’s sustainable economic development. In the mining industry, the contemporary concept of mapping artisanal and small-scale mining to the UN Sustainable Development Goals is a newer aspect of sustainability. SDG 5 aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. However, while there have been initiatives to support gemstone mining in Tanzania and East Africa, to date, the role of women in the lucrative tanzanite M2M supply chain has been less visible and a missed opportunity. This is a concern, as in 2019, pre-COVID-19 pandemic, gemstone and precious metals accounted for an incredible 33.2% of Tanzania’s total exports. In contrast, in leading mining countries such as Australia and Canada, the participation of women continues to steadily advance, economically empowering the women involved. This article contributes a critical review of Tanzanian mining regulation and licensing practice in a historical and gender equality context. A qualitative research case study showcases artisanal small-scale (ASM) tanzanite gemstone miner and entrepreneur Pili Hussein, with a view to support the formulation of a Tanzanian regional, female-oriented, M2M tanzanite strategy. The developed world experience of increasing levels of gender participation in mining provides evidence of a reduced gender pay gap and enhanced mine safety practice when women are involved. This research finds that increased investment in supporting women to participate in the tanzanite M2M gemstone supply chain positively impacts SDG 5 in the country. Furthermore, given Tanzania’s economic dependence on mining and the exceptional characteristics of rare, single-source tanzanite (a generational gemstones), we conclude that gender equality and female mine-to-market (M2M) entrepreneurship has an undervalued, yet important, role to play in Tanzania’s future socio-economic development.",Denoncourt J.A.,Supporting Sustainable Development Goal 5 Gender Equality and Entrepreneurship in the Tanzanite Mine-to-Market,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127953491&doi=10.3390%2fsu14074192&partnerID=40&md5=9605a12c2a12dd1a963a4c8e5fc74bd3

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"This article focuses on the strategic issue of an agile supply chain. Different goals are considered in supply chain design. Today, the concept of sustainability in supply chains plays an important role in goal setting. In general, sustainability leads to less economic, social, and environmental risks, and attention to this type of sustainability covers many criteria in the literature. Therefore, in this study, optimization of the stability of a supply chain network has been considered. In addition, a lesser-known aspect of sustainability, the political aspect, has been added to the previous aspects. This paper assumes four levels, namely supplier, wholesaler, retailer, and customer. An optimal network structure is designed to consider economic, social, and environmental sustainability and the new measure of political sustainability. The design of this supply chain is done by defining a mathematical model that has several objective functions, including economic, political, and environmental goals. These objective functions select the relationships and links between the levels in a supply chain network. For this purpose, a directional graph corresponding to a supply chain is designed. Then, with the help of an ideal multi-objective planning problem, an optimal configuration is obtained, which is a subgraph of the main network graph. The target problem has been modeled for a holding company which is a supply chain for COVID-19 drugs. Then, problem is solved using Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) metaheuristics algorithm and NSGAII multi-objective genetic algorithm. A comparison was carried out between these two methods, and the results indicated that MOPSO performed better. The value of the objective functions is calculated, and the best value for the considered functions is obtained. Also, the amount of drug supply has been obtained by two distributors.

International Journal of Business Performance and Supply Chain Modelling,"This article is concerned with designing a supply chain for organic textile products to improve, to increase and to ensure a fair distribution of profits for all participants in such a supply chain. To make such a supply chain as an integrated system, it was first important to ensure that the cotton products are produced organically, and then to suggest a supply chain in a 'win-win' strategy. The various contracts possible between the various members of the supply chain were presented and analysed mathematically using game theory. It was found that there were six possible contracts based on the scenarios of the game between the suppliers and the vendors. Further, it was possible to define the conditions which improve the profits in comparison with the case in which these contracts were not employed.

Applied Energy,"This article presents a comprehensive approach to design hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) targeting industrial and mobility markets. Even if the inclusion of sustainability criteria is paramount, only a few studies simultaneously consider economic, environmental, and social aspects - the most difficult to measure. In this paper, the safety risk and the social cost-benefit (SCB) have been identified as quantifiable social criteria that would affect society and the end-users. The objectives of this research are (1) to design a sustainable HSC by using four objective functions, i.e., levelized cost of hydrogen, global warming potential, safety risk and social cost-benefit through a mixed-integer linear programming model; (2) to compare results from SCB and multiobjective optimisation. The integration of the SCB criterion at the optimisation stage is not a trivial task and is one of the main contributions of this work. It implies the minimisation of the total cost of ownership (TCO) for buses and trucks. The evolution of the HSC from 2030 to 2050 is studied through a multiobjective and multiperiod optimisation framework using the ε-constraint method. The methodology has been applied to a case study for Hungary with several scenarios to test the sensitivity of demand type and volume as well as the production technology. The results analysis highlights that (1) it is beneficial to have mixed demand (industry and mobility) and a gradual introduction/migration to electrolysis technology and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) for a smooth transition. Liquid hydrogen produced via water electrolysis powered by nuclear and wind energy can result in an average levelized cost of $4.78 and 3.14 kg CO2-eq per kg H2; (2) the frameworks for multiobjective optimisation and SCB maximisation are complementary because they prioritise different aspects to design the HSC. Taxes and surcharges for H2 fuel will impact its final price at the refuelling station resulting in a higher TCO for FCVs compared to diesel buses and trucks in 2030 but the TCO becomes almost competitive for hydrogen trucks from 2035 when SCB is maximised. The SCB function can be refined and easily adapted to include additional externalities.","De-León Almaraz S., Rácz V., Azzaro-Pantel C., Szántó Z.O.",Multiobjective and social cost-benefit optimisation for a sustainable hydrogen supply chain: Application to Hungary,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136579427&doi=10.1016%2fj.apenergy.2022.119882&partnerID=40&md5=b3cd54eb6b7bfe01f1f668856d8e5e89
Sustainability (Switzerland),"This article presents an overview of the models applied to sustainable inventory management in supply chains and a roadmap for new research. It aims to address the lack of understanding of how sustainability is being incorporated into quantitative inventory management models in the supply chain context. The study is based on a classification of the reviewed literature according to the following criteria: supply chain structure, environmental approach, problem type, modeling, and solution approach. As a result, 36 articles were analyzed and classified. The main findings show that studies that incorporate social sustainability into inventory management along supply chains are lacking, while environmental studies are a growing research area. Uncertainty issues also need to be incorporated into sustainable inventory management models. Another important result of this study is the definition of a roadmap with trends and future research guidelines. The identified future research guidelines include incorporating decisions that can help to improve economic, environmental, and social sustainability.

Pacific Review,"This article provides empirical evidence of the emergence of new private governance forms through three case studies: transboundary air pollution, green supply chain, and energy transition in Northeast Asia. This article also refers to private governance theories discussed in the context of global environmental governance. Consistent with the private authority theory, entrepreneurs with vast expertise and capacity to provide useful information and practices have emerged. They allow stakeholders to cooperate in regional environmental sustainability under the conditions of weak or no focal institutions and heterogeneous state preferences. This observation is consistent with the global trend of environmental governance, which is shifting from regulatory-based to goal-setting governance. As global partnership theory suggests, hybrid forms of private governance, including various local- to global-level public–private partnerships, emerge across the cases. However, these forms of governance are still in the embryonic stage, where their functions of private authority are not fully developed.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"This article synthesizes the evidence on food value chains (FVCs) and regional food hubs (RFHs) through a systematic literature review and suggests future research directions based on the gaps identified in the review. The number of publications on FVCs and RFHs is increasing, indicating that these topics are gaining interest among scholars from different countries and disciplines. Bibliometric analysis and preferred reporting items for systematic review and a meta-analysis (PRISMA) flow chart are used to identify the data from Scopus. The results show that FVCs are an innovative solution to improve the skills and capacity of smallholder farmers through collaborative networks that can match the functions of RFHs. RFHs connect local producers and customers by operating a business based on social entrepreneurship and ecological approaches to increase local economic viability and the sustainability of agriculture products. FVCs and RFHs are designed to respond to supply chain insecurity with value-based approaches in order to achieve sustainable nutrition for the local community. Further research on FVCs and RFHs emphasizes that the business model of regional development in developing countries can improve food security sustainability based on social entrepreneurship, and emphasizes the environmental aspect that it can use to support the sustainability of developing countries local food.","Hermiatin F.R., Handayati Y., Perdana T., Wardhana D.",Creating Food Value Chain Transformations through Regional Food Hubs: A Review Article,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133907647&doi=10.3390%2fsu14138196&partnerID=40&md5=239ea59f968d99d771c3ca177cda5cf3

"Biomass, Biofuels, Biochemicals: Circular Bioeconomy: Technologies for Waste Remediation","This chapter focuses on the synthesis and application of agro-waste-based biochar with a perspective of circular bioeconomy. Numerous methods are known for the synthesis of biochar; however, pyrolysis of agro-waste is the highly acclaimed method for biochar production from agro-waste. Biochar production is influenced by multiple factors including nature and source of feedstock, pyrolysis conditions, and the system/device used for thermal treatment. The biochar properties enable it to be applied in several fields including wastewater treatment, soil improvement, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, carbon sequestration, sludge improvement, etc. The commissioning and erection of production facilities nearby agro-waste production sites, can reduce the supply chain and transport, and also improve the sustainability and development of circular bioeconomy. The application of biochar in water treatment can reduce the burden on market for the production and application of expensive adsorbents and hence, the agro-waste-based green adsorbent (biochar) can enhance bio-sustainability and subsequently circular bioeconomy.","Shahid M.K., Kashif A., Choi Y., Varjani S., Taherzadeh M.J., Rout P.R.",Circular bioeconomy perspective of agro-waste-based biochar,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131964317&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-323-88511-9.00016-1&partnerID=40&md5=309cbe24816e4663ab560649bc348a8f

Research Anthology on Strategies for Achieving Agricultural Sustainability,"This chapter presents the preliminary results of an ongoing research that empirically investigates the role of alternative food networks (AFNs) in supporting the development of the organic farming sector; moreover, it contributes in fostering sustainability approaches by small farmers. Specifically, the authors focus on how AFNs can boost sustainability in food consumption models and create an integrated way to support long-term competitiveness of organic farmers and, at the same time, satisfy consumers’ expectations. By adopting a mixed case-based methodology, the authors propose an analysis of the sustainability dimensions of organic farming and the sustainability characteristics of AFNs as agro-food systems alternatives to the conventional supply chains of modern distribution.

COVID-19 and its Reflection on SMEs in Developing Countries,"This chapter sets out to review in detail the available information on SMEs crisis management. Despite SMEs’ crucial role in the economy, relatively little research has been carried out on the effects of the economic crisis on SMEs and how they can cope with a crisis. This chapter will generate fresh insight into the crisis management for SMEs and provide a clear and easily understandable cash flow management strategies to survive COVID-19 and beyond. As an unexpected global crisis, COVID-19 pandemic has brought along mega uncertainty and potentially devastating consequences for everyone affected. It has challenged all conventional business thinking, therefore the most pressing concern for businesses is simply surviving it. In this “mega uncertain” environment, survival depends on performing timely, accurate diagnosis and treatment of the problem which means managing current cash flow efficiently and effectively in the short run for survival, then employing fresh cash creation strategies in the long run for sustainability. To be able to do that, it is necessary to have an in-depth knowledge of the industry, market, and the company itself, as well as an integrated, comprehensive, and up-to-date information management system. Moreover, the governments’ assistance is of primary importance in fighting against COVID-19 and reducing its negative impact on businesses, especially SMEs. Therefore, it is vital for SMEs to follow government measures. Besides, digitalization strategy enables SMEs to reduce their costs, to develop online marketing channels, diversifying into new business opportunities, and integrating supply chain.

Operations Management Research,"This empirical study aims to identify the importance of Digital Technologies (DT) as an enabler in the Circular Economy (C.E.) based business model, especially during Covid-19. The concept of 'circular economy' has now been advocated as a methodology to stimulate economic growth in line with the environmental sustainability. Hence, the practices of recycling, reduction, reuse/re-manufacture, and repairing (4R's) are deemed to be the core of a circular economy. Recently, the advent of the pandemic Covid-19 has forced the nations of the world to resort to alternate resource use in their manufacturing and trading of goods and services as the supply chains have almost remained disrupted since Covid-19 appeared. We investigate the impacts of Covid-19 upon the use of technological innovation (T.I.), circular economy practices (CEP), and organizational performance (ORP) incorporating the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Our results show that Covid-19 significantly impacted the adoption of technological innovation, circular economy, which leads toward organizational performance.

Soft Computing,"This paper addresses a sustainable cement supply chain network problem for an Indian city (Srinagar). The major problem addressed in this research is the dilemma of several sites and selecting sites to set up distribution centers and retail centers for cement supply chain networks. The primary goal of this research work is to focus on sustainable product delivery to clients, which leads us to the topic of facility site selection. The quality of a facility's location has a direct impact on the company's output and operations. As a result, businesses need to develop scientific and effective methodologies for assessing facility location issues and making informed decisions. The conundrum of several sites and picking places to set up distribution centers and retail centers for cement supply chain networks is the key challenge addressed in this research. This research focuses on the current state of the location problem, with an emphasis on the mathematical model and a genetic algorithm in the analysis and analytical approach of the location problem. In this regard, a sustainable supply chain network model has been developed. A real-coded genetic algorithm-based solution approach has been developed for optimizing the sustainable supply chain network design for Srinagar city. Using the input data as a search space for the solving procedure, the resulting solution will provide us with the ideal site selection points. A model for a long-term supply chain network has been established in this regard.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"This paper aims at analyzing sustainable practices that can be implemented within supply chains, linking them to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to show the performance achieved by SDG-oriented supply chains. Sustainable practices were collected from the repository “Business Process Framework for Sustainability” owned by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Salerno (Italy). By using literature research and descriptive statistics, there emerges a positive relationship between sustainable development and SC performance enhancement. From the study of the practices that can be implemented for cooperation activities with upstream and downstream supply chain partners, it emerges that companies have many opportunities of both supporting the 2030 Agenda and enhancing their market and organizational performance.

Operations Management Research,"This paper aims to design a mathematical model for sustainable closed-loop supply chains during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The proposed multi-objective model minimizes the total cost, carbon emission, and infection risk of the network and also maximizes social benefits. Some practical conditions such as stochastic demands, supplier selection, and facility disruptions are considered in the model. This stochastic model is transformed into a deterministic model by the Chance-Constrained Programming (CCP) approach. Thirty test datasets are applied to examine the effects of COVID-19 on the performance of the network. The problems are solved under two conditions (with and without COVID-19 considerations), and the results show that the total inventory of the model with COVID-19 is higher than the model without COVID-19. Moreover, the value of aggregated objectives of the model with COVID-19 is greater than the other model which indicates the greater distance from the optimal objectives. However, the computational efficiency of the model without COVID-19 is much higher than the other one. Some sensitivity analyses are also carried out, and several policy implications are proposed. According to the demand sensitivity analysis, when managers expect that the demands will increase, they should focus on the infection risk objective. On the contrary, when they expect decreased demands, they should pay more attention to environmental and economic objectives. The analysis of the objectives’ weights indicates that investing in the environmental and COVID-19 risk dimensions needs more financial resources compared to investing in the social dimension.","Mohammadi M., Nikzad A.",Sustainable and reliable closed-loop supply chain network design during pandemic outbreaks and disruptions,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135280278&doi=10.1007%2fs12063-022-00312-5&partnerID=40&md5=4bc298ac7a4d1039b0d70d148329e9f1
Process Integration and Optimization for Sustainability,"This paper aims to develop a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network model with a modular single product which is specifically designed for the automotive industry. Drawing upon sustainability criteria, three objective functions are formulated for the closed-loop network design problem including maximizing total profit across the network, minimizing the effects of environmental pollutants and maximizing employments created by the establishment of the required facilities and also maximizing the weighted sum of the minimum distance of facilities from the residential areas. In order to validate the research, a case study of the Iran’s automotive industry is also conducted. In addition, a scenario-based approach which applies the stochastic programming is used to cope with the uncertainty in both the demand and the amount of returned unusable vehicles. The results show that the stochastic programming approach is successful in mitigating the effects of uncertainties. Moreover, augmented ε-constraint methods are applied to deal with the proposed model. The preferred Pareto optimal solution achieves a 55.1% decrease in the environmental objective value, with only 0.2% increase in the economic objective value relative to the corresponding optimal value.","Shahedi A., Nasiri M.M., Sangari M.S., Werner F., Jolai F.",A Stochastic Multi-Objective Model for a Sustainable Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network Design in the Automotive Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119581524&doi=10.1007%2fs41660-021-00204-4&partnerID=40&md5=f0c1502846cf0d0ed0017259805c8deb
Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,"This paper aims to highlight the critical problems associated with the construction supply chain (CSC) by analyzing the literature and shedding light on the existing research limitations and gaps. Moreover, this research aims to explore the applications of emerging blockchain technology in addressing the identified CSC issues and initiating the process of bridging the body of knowledge gap by proposing future research directions. The review demonstrates that the critical problems in the CSC are related to sustainability, collaboration, and information sharing. Existing CSC studies focus on each individual issue, and they have not yet tackled these key intertwined issues through a holistic system view approach. This research put into context the intertwined relationship of these key issues and proposes a supply chain management system coupled with emerging blockchain technology to enhance sustainability, promote collaboration, and facilitate information sharing. These findings are synthesized with different reviews of the literature on the use of blockchain applications in supply chains to propose a blockchain-enabled CSC that can fill the research gaps. The proposed blockchain applications in the CSC involve establishing a blockchain-enabled supplier selection and assessment, blockchain-assisted claims auditing, forensic analysis and dispute resolution, and smart contract-based governance to enforce a reward and punishment system that can facilitate information sharing, and thus promote collaboration. The integration of the two different literature reviews contributes to the body of knowledge by highlighting the research gaps in the existing CSC studies and providing opportunities for improvement through the use of an emerging state-of-art technology: blockchain.

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"This paper aims to present an original assessment tool developed to diagnose industrial symbiosis (IS) readiness. It is expected that industries with greater symbiotic readiness are more likely to have success in implementing a circular business model. A bibliographic analysis was conducted in order to identify the IS variables and dimensions, mentioned in the literature, as necessary for implementation of a circular business model. Two dimensions were defined in this study: (i) exchange resources and (ii) exchange capacity. The exchange resources dimension diagnoses the company's ability to have the necessary exchange resources to IS implementation (water, energy, by-products, and waste). The exchange capacity dimension diagnoses the company's enabler factors to IS implementation (trust, information, access conditions, and infrastructure). After the definition of dimensions and their respective variables, an assessment tool to diagnose industrial symbiosis readiness was developed. The assessment tool is presented as a checklist format - Symbiotic Readiness Checklist (SRC). This was applied to six co-located industries in the State of São Paulo (Brazil). The proposed SRC could be used to: (a) diagnose the readiness of companies or organizations to implement industrial symbiosis; (b) be a tool in enterprise or organizational strategic planning; (c) assist the development of mechanisms to measure the number of resources consumed and waste produced in the supply chain; (d) assess the circularity of resources.","Agudo F.L., Bezerra B.S., Paes L.A.B., Gobbo Júnior J.A.",Proposal of an assessment tool to diagnose industrial symbiosis readiness,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123844688&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2022.01.013&partnerID=40&md5=0114531d4552333cef565411c4bcc7a2
ECS Transactions,"This paper aims to review various prevalent manufacturing practices such as leanness, agility, innovativeness, and sustainability in industries worldwide, further, this research paper also investigates the scope of interconnections between them and finds various gaps that further can be used for future research. An all-inclusive systematic review of 106 research papers was done during a time frame spread from 1991-2020 that included academic (journals, books, and thesis) that was based upon numerous aspects based on research tools and techniques applied, data gathering approaches (empirical-based research, case study based researches and literature analysis/review based study), data assortment techniques based on inquiry approach of research methodology (qualitative based research, quantitative-based research, and mixed-method approach). Moreover, research also focused on reviewing research papers based on country of origin, targeted demography, ultimate research objective, and timeline-based publications. Notably, leanness, agility, innovativeness, sustainability, performance measurement, MSMEs were well studied and analyzed. Moreover, these practices are well established in large-scale industries 1across the world but are more or less studied in isolation. Furthermore, very little literature supports the acceptance of these practices in manufacturing SMEs/MSMEs. Moreover, the holistic effect of these practices and their interrelationship is an important aspect that has been ignored in previous studies so the urge for adequate attention is required in this review of the literature. Many previous types of research are available in the domain of manufacturing industries that have highlighted the adoption of leanness, agility, innovativeness, sustainability as individual approaches or as a collective methodology that uses two or more practices were considered in the current study. This research considered only the manufacturing industries and excluded the service industries-based research papers. This literature review has recognized and analyzed various dimensions and roles of leanness, agility, innovativeness, sustainability that are prevalent in manufacturing industries that include the positive and negative effects on the performance of the industries.

International Journal of Production Economics,"This paper analyzes the multiperiod effects of a multi-tier supply chain network's economic, social, and environmental decision-making. The network consists of suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers who are multicriteria decision-makers. They are constrained by externality costs in taxation and consumers' preferences and willingness to pay for sustainable products. We develop an optimization model that allows us to investigate the interplay of different decision-makers and to compute the resultant network equilibrium pattern of productions, transactions, inventory levels, prices, and sustainability levels in the network over the multiperiod planning horizon. The numerical study simulates and analyzes the effects of consumers' willingness to pay, externality cost, production capacity, NPV (net present value) discount rate, sustainability investment, and the structure of the supply chain network, on the economic, social, and environmental sustainability.","Li D., Cruz J.M.","Multiperiod supply chain network dynamics under investment in sustainability, externality cost, and consumers’ willingness to pay",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124425036&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108441&partnerID=40&md5=27cc34b82e1f668bf72d841409affff9
Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,"This paper conducts a Delphi study to empirically explore the future roadmap of the circular economy (CE). Moreover, we build on the resource dependence theory to explore the CE's potential to reduce dependencies in supply chain (SC) networks. Based on current literature, the CE practices of the 4R framework (reduce, reuse, recycle, recover), and a series of workshops, we formulated 11 future-oriented projections. In two subsequent Delphi rounds, 78 international CE and SC management experts quantitatively assessed the projections regarding their probability of occurrence in 2030, their potential to reduce SC dependencies, and their desirability. A fuzzy c-means algorithm was applied to cluster the projections based on the expert assessments. We found that the implementation likelihood of CE practices in 2030 is not congruent with the value retention hierarchy advocated by the 4R framework. Qualitative analyses of the panelists’ written statements revealed that regulation, financial attractiveness, customer demand, technological innovation, and product design are the most prominent influencing factors for the future implementation of various CE practices. Moreover, different practices revealed a varying capacity to reduce SC dependencies. More precisely, we found that diversifying a company's supply base through recycled materials and components has the highest potential. Our qualitative data further provides evidence that CE practices’ capacity to lift dependencies can become an enabler for SC resilience.","Gebhardt M., Spieske A., Birkel H.",The future of the circular economy and its effect on supply chain dependencies: Empirical evidence from a Delphi study,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121495394&doi=10.1016%2fj.tre.2021.102570&partnerID=40&md5=03ae48217826fa3371bee83566d0efb6
Journal of Applied Science and Engineering (Taiwan),"This paper constructs the problem of dealing inventory and the transportation in the supply chain in the agriculture industry, also to investigate the capabilities of the distribution process of perishable products (vegetables) from the distribution centre (DC) to a set of customers to minimize the total operational cost. This research proposed an optimisation model to present the actual problem that happened in a real-life situation. The simulation of the transportation problem was developed using an algebraic modelling language which is called a mathematical programming language (AMPL) to determine an optimal solution. Thus, by setting the delivery routes for DC, based on the number of products that have been set for each customer, it helps to find an optimal inventory routing problem (IRP). As a result, an optimization model developed, it is predicted that agriculture firms can achieve an optimal solution by reducing their operational cost, especially on the inventory and transportation cost.","Harahap A.Z.M.K., Abdul Rahim M.K.I.",A Single Period Deterministic Inventory Routing Model for Solving Problems in the Agriculture Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127512251&doi=10.6180%2fjase.202212_25%286%29.0005&partnerID=40&md5=a89424ff684a9fcb4b9ee38ac2275315
"Environment, Development and Sustainability","This paper deals with statutory antibiotic waste management in a two-echelon sustainable pharmaceutical reverse supply chain. Due to detrimental impacts of improper disposal of unwanted/expired medicines on the environment, governments enact legislation regarding pharmaceutical waste management. According to environmental legislation, the manufacturer needs to collect a certain amount of pharmaceutical waste through a reverse channel. Duopolistic distributors are responsible for the collection process and compete on their return quantity, which depends on corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts through increasing public consciousness of unwanted/expired antibiotics. In this paper, the effects of distributors’ competitive CSR participation on the collected amount of antibiotics and costs of involving members are analytically investigated under decentralized and centralized mathematical models. A new saving-cost sharing contract is then proposed, which is capable of maximizing supply chain’s profitability and coordinating both levels of the reverse chain under competition. The results reveal that companies enjoy a considerable monetary benefit, improved social image, and higher sustainability level using the proposed scheme. Moreover, governmental penalties imposed on the companies also remarkably reduce. Therefore, the proposed model is considerably effective in mitigating the environmental pollution associated with pharmaceutical waste disposal.","Hosseini-Motlagh S.-M., Jazinaninejad M., Nami N.",Coordinating a socially concerned reverse supply chain for pharmaceutical waste management considering government role,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106741695&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-021-01511-z&partnerID=40&md5=6b4f1b4262500754d36a9829b489605d
Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization,"This paper describes the construction of a dual-channel electricity supply chain, with an electricity generation enterprise as the leader and an electricity retail enterprise as the follower, examining sustainability and price decision-making, and formulates a coordination contract to improve electricity supply chain performance. The main results are as follows. Firstly, sensitivity to electricity sustainability contributes to increased electricity sustainability, electricity price, electricity demand, and supply chain enterprises’ profits. Secondly, a centralized model is conducive to investment in more sustainable energy production.

iScience,"This paper develops a multi-sector and multi-factor structural gravity model that allows an analytical and quantitative decomposition of the emission and output changes into composition and technique effects. We find that the negative production shock of China's containment policy propagates globally via supply chains, with the carbon-intensive sectors experiencing the greatest carbon emission shocks. We further reveal that China's current stimulus package in 2021–2025 is consistent with China's emission intensity-reduction goals for 2025, but further efforts are required to meet China's carbon emissions-peaking target in 2030 and Cancun 2°C goal. Short-term changes in carbon emissions resulting from lockdowns and initial fiscal stimuli in “economic rescue” period have minor long-term effects, whereas the transitional direction of future fiscal stimulus exerts more predominant impact on long-term carbon emissions.

IMA Journal of Management Mathematics,"This paper develops an optimization model for a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network with two conflicting objectives, namely, the minimization of the total logistic costs and the total amount of carbon emissions. The first objective relates to financial benefits, whereas the second represents the wider goal of guaranteeing cleaner air and hence a greener and healthier planet. The problem is first modelled as a mixed integer linear programming based-model. The aim is to determine the location of distribution centres and recycling centres, their respective numbers and the type of vehicles assigned to each facility. Vehicle type consideration, not commonly used in the literature, adds another dimension to this practical and challenging logistic problem. A matheuristic using compromise programming is put forward to tackle the problem. The proposed matheuristic is evaluated using a variety of newly generated datasets which produces compromise solutions that demonstrate the importance of an appropriate balance of both objective functions. The robustness analysis considering fluctuations in customer demand is assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that if the standard deviation of the demand falls within 10% of its average, the unsatisfied demand is insignificant, thus demonstrating the stability of supply chain configuration. This invaluable information is key towards helping senior management make relevant operational and strategic decisions that could impact on both the sustainability and the resilience of their supply chain networks.","Ade Irawan C., Dan-Asabe Abdulrahman M., Salhi S., Luis M.",An efficient matheuristic algorithm for bi-objective sustainable closed-loop supply chain networks,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135376045&doi=10.1093%2fimaman%2fdpac003&partnerID=40&md5=fa0389a6cdfacd3c2c5fd6085e604e64

Questions were designed to provide rich, deep, and insightful opinions, lived experiences and perspectives of ATReG group members on group formation, challenges, strategies and achievements. Interview data was transcribed and analysed thematically, and the results were presented with important quotations presented. The ATReG consisted of English (n = 13) and French (n = 1) speaking sub-Saharan African (SSA) researchers who specialise in public health, epidemiology, optometry, information technology, supply chain management, psychiatry, community health, general medical practice, nutrition and biostatistics. Most members of the group reported an informal but well-coordinated structure of the group. Formed during the pandemic, all group meetings were held online, and many members are yet to meet each other in person. The group collected data from Africans and published 10 peer reviewed journal articles on COVID-19 within two years. It presented in international conferences, engaged with the media and the public and was awarded a national competitive funding in Nigeria all of which which contributed to career progression and academic promotion of some members. There have been challenges in sustaining the research collaboration and maintaining productivity. Challenges include difficulties meeting deadlines and obtaining funding for research activities. However, these challenges have been addressed through a collaborative problem-solving approach. The study found the need for operational and methodological flexibility, centralised coordination, and established funding sources as being essential for long term sustainability and performance of the group. The ATReG’s objective of providing useful data on COVID-19 and generating useful knowledge about COVID-19 in SSA has been achieved.

Second, what are the main managerial and strategic implications and consequences of this for the agri‐food sector in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, cost reduction, and supply chain optimization? Finally, the paper presents Italy as a case study, chosen both for its peculiar internal differences in logistical infrastructures and entrepreneurial management between Northern and Southern regions (which could be at least partially overcome with the use of new technologies and frameworks) and for the importance of the agri‐food sector for the domestic economy (accounting about 25% of the country’s GDP), on which digitization should have positive effects in terms of value creation and sustainability.","Remondino M., Zanin A.",Logistics and Agri‐Food: Digitization to Increase Competitive Advantage and Sustainability.

By utilising the framework by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, Practical Guidance by the Home Office and the Global Reporting Initiative, we assess the extent and quality of modern slavery disclosures. Our analysis reveals a high level of compliance to the Act's minimum disclosure requirements. We also note an increase in the extent and quality of disclosures following the introduction of the Act, although quality remains low throughout the period as symbolic disclosure is predominantly in evidence. Drawing on normativity theory we identify intrinsic and contextual conditions for norm development. We find that while the presence of intrinsic conditions has positively contributed to the extent and quality of some disclosure themes, the lack of controllability and communication with suppliers has undermined related disclosure provision and constitutes a major hurdle for improving accountability in supply chains.","Mai N., Vourvachis P., Grubnic S.",The impact of the UK's Modern Slavery Act (2015) on the disclosure of FTSE 100 companies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136580531&doi=10.1016%2fj.bar.2022.101115&partnerID=40&md5=27dce3397656a14676abdd831b61f51b

Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,"This paper identifies that Industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigm does result in increased cyber-security risks for companies and industries that employ it. However, cyber-threats existed prior to that of I4.0 and although there is greater vulnerability under this paradigm there is also greater ability to protect against such attacks as technology evolves. For companies to maintain as high a possible level of cyber-security they must adapt their systems with the times staying as up to date as possible. In conclusion, after conducting a literature review to understand every aspect of the problem and solution and assessing their compatibility through the completion of the critical analysis; I4.0 is a suitable solution to the sustainability problems of manufacturing in the fashion retail industry. There are gaps in the research identified and resulting limitations to the ability of I4.0 to be the solution to all the sustainability problems identified.

International Journal of Production Research,"This paper introduces the background, concept and definition of the Industry Commons. It initiates a discussion on the positioning of the Industry Commons Ecosystem (ICE) with respect to current research directions in advanced manufacturing and production systems that shape advances in engineering and technology, novel business models and innovation breakthroughs. The potential value of data sharing across industrial domains is estimated at over $100 billion, particularly in view of optimising manufacturing processes. Data sharing across domains however faces a series of well-documented challenges associated with the lack of semantic interoperability and related standards, management of trust and sustainability. Solving bottlenecks in data sharing requires a systemic approach to data management, which can account for all aspects of data use, levels of application, attribution and dynamic exchanges.

RAIRO - Operations Research,"This paper investigates Government intervention in a three-echelon supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one retailer. Government is the top level member trying to reduce environmental impacts based on the amount of carbon emission during the production process. Government controls the chain by collecting tax from the retailer which is indirectly paid by the customer and paying subsidy/imposing fine on the manufacturer. Government encourages manufacturer to reduce carbon emission by contributing some subsidy and also makes an effort to generate Government net revenue (GNR) by imposing tax. The GNR is generated by collecting tax from the retailer on the sold product and penalty from the manufacturer at the trading price for the extra amount of emissions. The retail price is decided based on the selling price, tax and greening level. We aim to determine optimal levels of pricing, greening and amount of tax to be levied. The models for both linear and iso-elastic demand patterns are developed. The aim of this piece research is two-fold: (i) review the existent literature on the relationship between environmental collaboration and sustainability performance and (ii) render a tenable prototype of supply chain to illuminate the relationship between sustainability and profitability. According to the aforesaid goals this paper has carried out a detailed empirical research by using advanced structural equation modelling approaches. The research findings will be particularly important for manufacturing companies struggling to find techniques to achieve sustainability performance.

Using a case study, data were collected from different downstream SC members and examined by an inductive content analysis. The results show managerial activities transformed into a bundle of sustainability practices to identify how to translate changes developed from upstream to downstream SC (i.e. to engage end customers in the SC). This bundle includes cognitive (informing and training), emotional (involving, respecting, and protecting) and behavioural (changing mindset) practices. For instance, through advertising, the company informs (i.e. a cognitive element) end customers regarding its focus on local sourcing by showing both the raw material used and the supplier selection, and consequently, awakens a new market behaviour.

Operations Management Research,"This paper investigates joint sustainability initiatives and power dynamics in a sustainable supply chain. The study considers a dyadic supply chain under a non-linear demand setup. It develops and analyzes nine different decentralized scenarios arising from different joint sustainability efforts and power structures. The study evaluates supply chain agents’ sustainability efforts, pricing strategies, and profits under various scenarios and subsequently compares them to obtain the most preferred strategy. The findings show that the supply chains structure significantly influences players’ sustainability efforts and profits in a supply chain. We also compare the players’ profit between different structures of power dynamics, and the results reveal that if a player is responsible for greening efforts and holds a leadership position, it always leads to a win-win situation for supply chain agents.

It reveals that the revenue sharing mechanism fails to coordinate the supply chain. Thus, the study proposes a hybrid contract to coordinate the sustainable supply chain.

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"This paper investigates the link between servitization and sustainability. Extant literature assumes a positive effect of servitization on sustainability, while limited contributions report that, under certain conditions, servitization can also have negative effects. Through a case study on the professional printer supply chain, we show that the positive relationship between servitization and sustainability does not always hold true, and we clarify the nature of the links between servitization and sustainability. By drawing on causal loop diagrams based on system dynamics modeling, we differentiate between “built-in sustainability in servitization” and “sustainability potential in servitization”. With the former, we refer to the inherent sustainability effect that results from the mere application of servitization. For example, servitization leads, ceteris paribus, to the reduction of the number of required printers to achieve the printing jobs required by customers. The latter shows, however, that there is a latent sustainability potential that can be released, only if refurbishing and component recycling activities take place to extend the product lifetime. The case study also highlights that a systemic view is essential for assuring the overall positive impact of servitization on the environment. If manufacturing firms or institutions cannot track the way printers are disposed, e.g., outside of the borders of a country, the full potential of sustainability embedded in servitization cannot be achieved.","Abdelkafi N., Pero M., Masi A., Capurso I.",Revisiting the servitization-sustainability link: A case study in the professional printing supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135458724&doi=10.1016%2fj.clscn.2022.100061&partnerID=40&md5=0cde81d88255b769cf2628c22baafc9f
Engineering Journal,"This paper is to develop an integrated approach of supplier evaluation and order allocation to suppliers that suggests the buyer to place more orders to the supplier that has higher evaluation score (consistent order allocation) considering sustainability issues including economic, social, environmental, and disruption of supply chain issues. The proposed approach is handled by an Evaluation Score based Linear Programming (ESLP) Model. Performances of ESLP model is compared with those of Multiple Objective Linear Programming (MOLP) model that does not explicitly consider the evaluation scores of suppliers for order allocation. Experimental results show that ESLP model offers consistent order allocation while MOLP model offers inconsistent order allocation. Moreover, MOLP model has different priorities of suppliers for order allocation when the customer demands are changed. Inconsistent order allocation makes the purchasing process nontransparent, unexplainable, and susceptible for biased decisions. ESLP and MOLP models generate compromised solutions that are nondominated. They are better and worse for some performances. This paper emphasizes a need of further research that develops consistent order allocation methods.","Sriklab S., Yenradee P.",Consistent and Sustainable Supplier Evaluation and Order Allocation: Evaluation Score based Model and Multiple Objective Linear Programming Model,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126530572&doi=10.4186%2fej.2022.26.2.23&partnerID=40&md5=2ab36e81ec611cc0229e88c5c76359ca

Production Engineering Archives,"This paper presents a framework of contemporary quality costs concept contributing to a more sustainable society regarding an integrated view of quality costs in all phases of the product life cycle (engineering, production, use, and end-of-life) by all stakeholders in the supply chain. The development of this framework is viewed through the complementarity of the sustainability dimensions and the circular economy concept understood as a waste management concept, which represents a solid basis for the development of a novel approach to understanding quality costs which, in turn, reflects the sustainable quality concept. By providing sustainable criteria (economic, environmental, and social) as an integral part of the quality costs concept, this framework will improve the sustainability performance in the early phases of product design, increase the added value of the products and the duration of the added value, and strengthen the responsibility of all stakeholders beyond the limits of their organizational processes. This will inevitably lead to changes to the quality cost structure, dominated by new quality costs elements which reflect sustainability.

International Journal of Systems Science: Operations and Logistics,"This paper presents a single-manufacturer single-retailer supply chain model with an imperfect production system at the manufacturer. The manufacturer meets the order quantity of the retailer in unequal-sized shipments. After receiving each delivery, the retailer performs an inspection process that is erroneous and results in misclassification errors (Type-I and Type-II errors). Defective items are returned to the manufacturer, who conducts a rigorous screening to classify the defective items into repairable, design-flawed and non-repairable ones. The manufacturer incurs carbon emissions cost due to transportation and disposal of scrap items to get one step closer to sustainability. Customers at the retailer are influenced by retail price and sales effort. Optimal shipment policy, pricing and inventory decisions are determined in both the decentralised (based on the Stackelberg leader-follower gaming approach) and the centralised scenarios. A trade credit mechanism and wholesale price discount contract are employed and a fair profit-sharing strategy is implemented based on the supply chain member's bargaining power. The conditions for participating in these coordination mechanisms are examined from the point of view of each supply chain member.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"This paper proposes a new life cycle assessment (LCA) statistics method to calculate the energy consumption of Chinese buildings from the perspective of LCA under the sustainable supply chain system. We divide the life cycle of buildings into the materialization stage, the construction stage, and the operation stage. Based on the new LCA statistics method, we obtain the following findings. First, the growth of total building energy consumption has slowed down since 2014, and its share of the Chinese total energy consumption levels off, remaining at about 40%. In 2018, the stages of materialization, construction, and operation account for about 34.02%, 4.65%, and 61.33% in total building energy consumption, respectively. Second, the materialization and operation stages are the main sources of energy consumption in the whole supply chain. Energy consumption in the materialization stage has been declining year by year since 2014, due to the impact of energy-saving policy. Moreover, we find that energy consumption in the operation and construction stages has been increasing year by year. Finally, in the life cycle of Chinese buildings, energy consumption in the operation stage plays a dominant role.

International Journal of Management Science and Engineering Management,"This paper proposes a novel plan-do-check-act (PDCA) based group decision making model to evaluate the GSCM performance of manufacturing organizations. This research employs an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach in which the fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method determines criteria weights and the fuzzy-technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (FTOPSIS) method ranks the organizations. Five qualitative criteria are selected from the extant literature, which encompass both environmental, operational, and economic aspects of sustainability. Data is collected by developing a questionnaire, establishing a decision-makers’ committee, and carrying out a survey. To illustrate the industrial application of the proposed model, this study considers a real-world case study in the Indian manufacturing sector, in which three organizations (Organization A, Organization B, and Organization C) are selected from three distinct industrial segments, namely the leather industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and the steel industry, respectively. The result reveals that the environmental impact of harmful substances released from production is the most influential parameter. The result also reveals that Organization C is the benchmark organization and its strategies can guide other organizations for GSCM performance improvement.

Transportation Research Record,"This paper proposes a text analytics approach using dictionary-based clustering, word counting data, and discrete regression modeling to study the relationship between demand behaviors and supply issues affecting supply chain resilience during the first stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The work used news and media articles gathered from the LexisNexis database covering 5 months between February and July 2020. The data analyses describe the general patterns in the news texts by using text mining techniques, and the methodology describes the relationship between consumer behavior, supply chain issues, and the reduced level of service shown during the study period. Demand behaviors include precautionary and opportunistic buying, which affected many countries and could be the result of a lack of perceived control and other factors; for example, near-empty shelves of certain products could have prompted consumers to increasingly look for comparable products, driving up demand. Additionally, the method explored the potential effect of strategies to mitigate impacts on the resilience of supply chains. The results confirmed that buying behaviors and a reduction in the capacity of the supply chain led to a lower level of service being perceived by consumers, however, resilience strategies were found to mitigate the impact of such capacity reductions. Empirical analyses showed that the proposed approach, using data extracted from the news, could identify and represent impacts consistent with expectations from the supply chain field under disruptions, and quantify the magnitude of the impacts as the pandemic evolved, providing more information for decision making.","Rivera-Royero D., Jaller M., Jenn A.",Impacts of Precautionary and Opportunistic Buying Behaviors and Supply Issues on Supply Chain Resilience During the COVID-19 Pandemic,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139521381&doi=10.1177%2f03611981221124880&partnerID=40&md5=b7ca13863f01ab066b559c4c0fa167de
Crop and Pasture Science,"This paper reviews early experiences, expectations and obstacles concerning the adoption of digital technologies in Australian livestock systems. Using three case studies of publicly-available information on Australia's red meat industry, we identify the process of digitally enhanced value creation according to four themes: (1) supply chain operability; (2) product quality; (3) animal welfare; and (4) innovation and learning. We find reasons for both optimism and pessimism concerning the adoption of digital agriculture. While digital technology is being offered by various stakeholders to support collaboration within supply chains, it is also being met with scepticism amongst some producers who are not actively engaging with a digital transformation. We identify that the 'technology fallacy', which proposes that organisations, people, learning and processes are as important to digital transformation as the technology itself; but while digital technologies enable change, it is the people who determine how quickly it can occur. We argue that-since quality appears to be the major basis on which Australian red meat producers will compete in global markets-the broad adoption of digital technology will prove increasingly essential to future growth and sustainability of this supply chain.","Jackson E.L., Cook S.",The complex adoption pathways of digital technology in Australian livestock supply chains systems,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134464616&doi=10.1071%2fCP21593&partnerID=40&md5=d2472945ae4d534168822c15ce8a34e8
European Urban and Regional Studies,"This paper utilises the ‘sustainable innovation journeys’ concept to trace how people organise and design urban food initiatives and influence city-region food policy. We evaluate whether designs succeed or fail and monitor the exchange of ideas that takes place between stakeholders. Tracing these interactions reveals the transformative potential of innovative projects, particularly if the food system changes they bring to the fore are aligned with policy interests. Three case studies provide on-the-ground insights to assess how small and medium-sized enterprises at the micro-level induce sustainability shifts. The case studies are businesses in the city-regions of Rotterdam, The Netherlands (urban farm and circular food economy); Vigo, Spain (food, forest and multi-functional land use); and Zurich, Switzerland (organic food and short supply chains). Each initiative was studied in-depth over a two-year period, with follow-up analysis for a further four years to monitor change over time (2013–2018). The cases promote the adoption of micro-level innovation practices: locally designed transition pathways that bring the benefits of change to the city-region (i.e. from the micro-level initiative to meso-level policy). The analysis highlights the importance of ‘soft change’. This can be something as simple as visiting an inspiring urban food initiative and meeting with stakeholders to generate mutual understanding, from where interests align to influence food chain practices and policy. Soft changes act as ‘seeds of transition’ for a shift towards more sustainable urban food systems, but we observe too potentially negative impacts due to lack of alignment at the micro- (initiative) or meso- (city-region) levels.","Maye D., Swagemakers P., Wiskerke J.S.C., Moschitz H., Kirwan J., Jahrl I.","Transformative potential from the ground up: Sustainable innovation journeys, soft change and alignment of interests in urban food initiatives",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113151591&doi=10.1177%2f09697764211028887&partnerID=40&md5=df4a32db7b94b476bbcb14d9d181f219

Food Policy,"This research aims to fill the information gap between the increase in food consumption away from home and the lack of understanding of Americans’ preferences for information transparency of food served in casual and fine dining restaurants. Online discrete choice experiments are applied to elicit consumer preferences for transparency of seafood entrée attributes. Consumers strongly prefer entrées with transparent information on species specification, country of origin, production methods, sustainability certification, and sustainability rating. At fine dining restaurants, the most important attributes are sustainability rating, species specification, and price, whereas sustainability rating, species specification, and sustainability certification are the top three attributes at casual restaurants. Furthermore, sustainable certification significantly increases the probability of an entrée being selected, and low-value species benefit more from the sustainability certification than do high-value species.

The paper tries to investigate electricity shortage effects not only on the industrial side, but also from the standpoint of society. In our model, different forecasting methods such as linear regression, time series analysis, and gray forecasting are also considered to predict the parameters. Further tests such as the structure, dimension, historical fit, and sensitivity of the model are also conducted in this paper. Through analysis forecasting result, we believe that the demand for electricity in Taiwan will continue to increase to a certain level for a period of time in the future. This phenomenon is closely related to Taiwan's economic development, especially industrial development. We also point out that electricity prices in Taiwan do not match with high industrial demand, and that prices are still slightly low.

Applied Geography,"This research analyzed cocoa deforestation within the framework of land-use policies to support efforts to implement deforestation-free cocoa commitments in Ghana. Land-use maps for 1986, 1999, and 2017 were used to explore cocoa deforestation around three contexts: (1) Gross deforestation – forest conversions irrespective of the legal provisions governing land use; (2) Forest reserves encroachment - conversions within forest reserves; and (3) ‘Admitted farms’ and off-reserve deforestation - conversions within the framework of applicable national legislative provisions. The results showed 90.71% ‘admitted farms’ and off-reserve deforestation, and 9.29% forest reserve encroachments. The conversions in the off-reserve and ‘admitted farm’ constitute land-use decision-making conforming to the Forests act 1927 and the Land Use and Spatial planning act 2016. Thus, we seek to argue the following: (1) the dynamics of deforestation should be situated within the land use policy provisions; (2) The use of gross deforestation as the basis for any legislative due diligence provision would be at variance with national legislation and might pose difficulties in achieving the deforestation-free objectives; (3) Gross deforestation should be separated from admitted farm, and off-reserve deforestation.

It examines both short-term and medium-to-long-term impacts of the pandemic and outlines strategies to reduce the potential consequences of those impacts. To this end, we use a qualitative, multiple-case-study methodology, collecting data from eight sample companies with fourteen respondents in the food and beverage industry in Bangladesh. The findings show that the short-term impacts of this pandemic, such as product expiry, shortage of working capital, and limited operations of distributors, are severe, while the medium-to-long-term impacts promise to be complex and uncertain. In the longer term, various performance metrics, such as return on investment by the firms, the contribution of the firms to the gross domestic product (GDP), and employee size, are all expected to decrease. Moreover, firms may need to restructure their supply chain and build relationships with new distributors and trade partners. The study proposes several strategies that managers in this sector can adopt to improve resiliency in the changing environment during and after the COVID-19 era. While this research is novel and contributes to both theory and practice, it does not consider small and medium-sized companies in the food and beverage industry. Therefore, the impacts and strategies we identify may not apply to smaller companies.","Chowdhury M.T., Sarkar A., Paul S.K., Moktadir M.A.",A case study on strategies to deal with the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic in the food and beverage industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091725668&doi=10.1007%2fs12063-020-00166-9&partnerID=40&md5=313413768eb4ea18b61839fb5e97ceb9
Sustainability (Switzerland),"This research investigates the tension between trust and confidentiality in Mobile Supply Chains (MSCs), where a production asset that is owned by one of the partners is outsourced to another partner of the supply chain for the production of goods, chemicals, or pharmaceuticals. The novelty of the MSC concept is to be found in its innovative and sustainable approach to production and operation processes in supply chains. Implementation of the MSC model could, however, raise trust and confidentiality concerns. The interplay of trust and confidentiality, or preservation of information privacy, between partners plays a central role in the supply chains, particularly because they are genuinely dependent on each other. Qualitative data analysis was used, in which semi-structured interviews with the experts from the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in Germany were conducted to investigate the tension between trust and confidentiality, and important factors affecting it. The results of the study present four different integration scenarios, namely, the low-quality, conservative, grey-box, and innovation scenarios, which consider different levels of trust, confidentiality and information sharing. Subsequently, the tension between trust and confidentiality is analyzed within these scenarios, and three effective strategies which encourage partners to balance the tension between trust and confidentiality are proposed. The study indicates that the balance between trust and confidentiality can be maintained in some scenarios when critical factors such as transparency, trust negotiation, and a reward-sharing system are present.","Ghondaghsaz N., Chokparova Z., Engesser S., Urbas L.",Managing the Tension between Trust and Confidentiality in Mobile Supply Chains,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125058695&doi=10.3390%2fsu14042347&partnerID=40&md5=6a2fc078950497d06cfff432aa4a3bd7
Sustainability (Switzerland),"This research paper analyzes the key influences of external disruptions on the business sustainability of medium-sized manufacturing companies operating in Serbia. This paper explores the strategic management of massive external disruptions (such as the global pandemic in 2020) and unveils key correlations between internal and external influences. The quantitative part of this research includes two phases; the first was conducted in 2019, with predictions made in the pre-pandemic period, and the second phase was conducted in 2022 by comparing the predictions with actual business results. Existing theoretical research has already identified many weaknesses, including how strategic business outlooks (in relation to economic downturns and bottlenecks within supply chains) influence the success of medium-sized companies, as well as internal factors, such as strategic management and the flexible adjustment of business plans. Taking into account that the whole world is still recovering after the pandemic, the empirical research conducted on 580 Serbian companies sheds light on how the pandemic disruption has affected businesses. As business plans relate to forecasted revenue, profit margins and investment effects, the main results of this study confirm that predicted business results are significantly influenced by supply chain disruptions, negatively affecting companies relying on the import of raw material and companies that have widely internationalized their sales efforts.","Damnjanovic A.M., Dzafic G., Nesic S., Milosevic D., Mrdak G., Arsic S.M.",Strategic Management of External Disruptions on Realization of Business Plans—Case of Serbian Manufacturing Companies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138698394&doi=10.3390%2fsu141811583&partnerID=40&md5=79751653365619bbfd4f7f0e45295464
European Journal of Operational Research,"This research proposes a game theory model in a supply chain (SC) involving one manufacturer and one retailer. The SC works in a global market in which consumers are located worldwide and subject to traceability issues that can create distrust of the product quality. This issue can be resolved by implementing blockchain technology which provides benefits in terms of high traceability along with low transaction costs. However, blockchain negatively impacts the environment because of their high energy consumption. Therefore, in this study, we capture the trade-offs between traceability and sustainability for blockchain adoption by characterizing a game theory model. Our findings show that high levels of distrust pushes firms to avoid the implementation of blockchain. In such circumstances, blockchain is not sufficient to make consumers recognize the product quality and trust the firms’ practices. In contrast, low levels of distrust can make blockchain an economically suitable technology conditioned to minimal environmental damages; otherwise, firms need to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between distrust and sustainability. Since the adoption of blockchain leads to an increase in prices and decrease of distrust, two factors determine whether to pursue this technology or not: low consumer sensitivity to price and high sensitivity to quality. In this study, we develop three specific cases where we model: 1) the direct impact of blockchain on distrust, 2) a stochastic distrust term, and 3) a Stackelberg game. Each case confirms our results and strengthens the robustness of our findings.","Biswas D., Jalali H., Ansaripoor A.H., De Giovanni P.",Traceability vs. sustainability in supply chains: The implications of blockchain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131245317&doi=10.1016%2fj.ejor.2022.05.034&partnerID=40&md5=c39338c8b089a9a8a72d9655f81904f5

Journal of Dairy Science,"This study aimed to assess consumer knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions toward dairy products from sheep and goats. A web-based survey was conducted in Latin America (Mexico and Chile), Europe (Italy, Spain, Greece, and Denmark), and Asia (Bangladesh). From March to June 2021, adult participants answered an online survey available in 5 languages. In total, 1,879 surveys were completed. Categorical and ordinal data were analyzed as frequencies and percentages. To determine the relationship between the variables for purchasing and consumption behaviors of respondents who declared that they consume dairy products, a multiple correspondence analysis was carried out. Most completed surveys were from Mexico and Italy (30% and 33.7%, respectively). Most respondents were between 18 and 29 yr old, female, highly educated, and employed. The majority of respondents (70.8%) declared that they consume dairy products from small ruminants. Consumers preferred products from both sheep and goats (49.4%); however, it was observed that in Mexico, Denmark, and Bangladesh, more than 50% preferred goat dairy products. The most-consumed products were mature and fresh cheeses. Mature cheese was the most-preferred product in Chile; in Mexico, Italy, Greece, and Denmark, it was fresh cheese. Unlike the rest of the countries, in Bangladesh, dairy product consumption from small ruminants was observed by more than 30% of respondents. In Mexico, a higher percentage of people do not consume sheep or goat dairy products because they are unfamiliar with them. In Mexico, Chile, and Bangladesh, limited market availability was also a variable responsible for nonconsumption. In European and Asian countries, sheep and goat dairy products are not consumed because consumers dislike them, in addition to a greater awareness of sustainability and climate change issues. The multiple correspondence analysis defined 5 dimensions. Dimension 1 was associated with the geographic location of the respondent (country and continent), the type of milk (sheep or goat), and the consideration of well-being and health as characteristics associated with the consumption of dairy products from small ruminants. Dimension 2 was associated with the respondent's country of origin and the frequency of consumption. Dimension 3 was associated with gender, education, and employment status. Dimension 4 was associated with the respondent's age, the association of the “healthy” concept of sheep and goat dairy products, and the consideration of the nutritional benefits of dairy as responsible for considering them healthy. Dimension 5 was associated with a “strong smell and taste” of sheep and goat dairy products. This study showed that consumer attitudes toward dairy products from sheep and goats vary between continents. In conclusion, results showed consumer interest in animal welfare and environmental impact issues related to small ruminant farming as well as a general attraction to local products. It seems that these factors contribute to consumers' perception of the quality of dairy products, so the industry and select farmers should carefully consider incorporating them into their supply chain.","Vargas-Bello-Pérez E., Tajonar K., Foggi G., Mele M., Simitzis P., Mavrommatis A., Tsiplakou E., Habib M.R., Gonzalez-Ronquillo M., Toro-Mujica P.",Consumer attitudes toward dairy products from sheep and goats: A cross-continental perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139014061&doi=10.3168%2fjds.2022-21894&partnerID=40&md5=f77049077831d9ccfe14c883a546c4a2

Waste Management,"This study aims to analyze the influence of Chinese government subsidy on e-waste treatment formal and informal reverse supply chains (RSC) and to explore the optimal formal channel structure. Under the formal recycler-Stackelberg game, we establish three game theory models respectively under the conditions of price insensitive and price sensitive overall collection quantity. In each model, a dual-channel RSC, the green technology investment decision of formal recycler and a subsidy for formal recycler are modelled. Besides, the three models are different in collectors and collection effort implementers of the formal channel. Through mathematical modelling and comparison analysis, the study concludes that the best choice for the formal recycling enterprises is to establish its own collection channel or centralize other independent collection channels. Under the condition of price insensitive overall collection quantity, the suboptimal choice is to implement collection effort positively. Under the condition of price sensitive overall collection quantity, the suboptimal choice is to outsource the collection effort when formal recycling enterprises benefit more from the collection effort. And the phenomenon is more outstanding when the overall collection quantity can be greatly improved by the collection price. For governments, they are recommended to prudently implement the subsidy and determine the amount of subsidy because the subsidy may benefit informal channels and the effectiveness of the subsidy varies along with formal channel structures. This study is beneficial for the promotion of formal RSC by providing the optimal channel structure for formal recycling enterprises and indicating the optimal subsidy for governments.","Wang J., Li W., Mishima N., Adachi T.",Exploring the optimal reverse supply chain for e-waste treatment under Chinese government subsidy,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118532498&doi=10.1016%2fj.wasman.2021.10.031&partnerID=40&md5=1a3d24dc451f46c9398ad492f91b33c5

Sustainability (Switzerland),"This study aims to develop a multi-objective second-generation-based socially responsible supply chain (SGB-SRSC) network design model that considers all dimensions of sustainability: economy, environment, and social. The dynamic nature of the biodiesel supply chain (SC) impairs the SGB-SRSC model decisions; thus, a grey-fuzzy solution approach is developed. Biodiesel is a promising renewable energy resource produced from a variety of easily accessible domestic wastes. For a swift transition towards commercially feasible biodiesel production, integrated optimization of the biodiesel SC system is critical. Using the latest social impact assessment tools, this study provides a decision-support system for developing a biodiesel SC network. A comprehensive computational analysis is performed on a case study to validate the proposed model. The results show that significant investment is required to achieve social well-being goals and secure decisions against uncertainty associated with SGB-SRSC model parameters. Further, it is observed that the expenses of biodiesel production and biodiesel plant installation accounted for a large portion of the overall SC cost.

Business Strategy and the Environment,"This study aims to investigate focal firms' business sustainability relationships in connection with their stakeholders in supply chain networks. A questionnaire survey was sent to a sample consisting of large Swedish firms, with 107 usable questionnaires returned. The results reveal which stakeholders are of interest for firms in sustainability efforts. The results are compared with earlier findings from Norway and Spain in a triangular approach. The former is a similar country, while the latter is different to Sweden in several ways. In addition, the study uncovers which stakeholders in the supply chain network should be considered. The study also demonstrates how firms can implement business sustainability in their supply chain networks and shows the extent to which different stakeholders are considered in sustainability efforts.

The case study has been conducted using situation–actor–process (SAP) and learning–action–performance (LAP) model to systematically inquire the association between environmental collaboration and sustainable consumption and production goals in an auto sector supply chain. Using the SAP-LAP model, we tried to understand the complexities and interactions among the current situation, involved actors and processes influencing environmental collaboration for attaining sustainable consumption and production for the case study in an automobile firm. The SAP analysis presents a condition of environmental collaboration practices for sustainable consumption and production goal in the automobile supply chain in India. Then, LAP provides the learning followed by the suggested actions that can be taken to improve the performance of environmental collaboration for sustainable consumption and production goal. Therefore, the findings underscore the strategic significance for a firm to collaborate with its suppliers, customers and internal departments to improve performance in the supply chain.

This study adopts a comparative research approach and investigates direct strategies adopted by various food supply chain actors to mitigate the impact of covid-19. This study compares how retailers Checkers, Woolworths, and Pick n Pay have adapted their business models to remain resilient during COVID-19 lockdown. The results show that the food supply chain remained resilient even with demand management challenges at the lockdown. Food supply chain issues came under a spotlight as borders and production plants were shut down or restricted to contain the spread of the virus. This study establishes that the food shortage is primarily caused by panic buying at the beginning of lockdown, causing shock in the supply chain cadence. The other aspect of food security issue is attributed to food availability and socioeconomic problems resulting from loss of income. On sustainability, there are fears that control measures such as packaging (increased use of plastic), cleaning chemicals, waste and sanitisation of space to maintain hygiene as required for covid-19 can undermine the gains towards preserving the environment.","Njomane L., Telukdarie A.",Impact of COVID-19 food supply chain: Comparing the use of IoT in three South African supermarkets,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135521112&doi=10.1016%2fj.techsoc.2022.102051&partnerID=40&md5=e4b7c7789e3913d80dc686b37e41b715
International Journal of Production Economics,"This study analyzes the economic consequences of Korean firms' strategic decision to participate in government policy that is designed to foster social sustainability and cooperation across supply chains in 2011–2016. Specifically, it investigates whether Korean firms’ decision to participate in supply chain cooperation policy is associated with firm performance, in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI), alongside its marketing, production and inventory resource efficiencies. The study contributes to empirical research on social sustainability in supply chains and instrumental stakeholder theory. Within a potential-outcomes framework, an endogenous treatment effects model is adopted to address the endogenous treatment in the decision to participate, and unobservable firm characteristics. The study provides evidence in support of instrumental stakeholder theory. The results confirm that unobserved characteristics of the firm impact the selection decision and firm performance. After correcting for endogeneity, the results show that the effect of participation is positive and statistically significant. But this positive relationship is contingent on the extent to which firms are resource efficient. Inventory resource efficiency is found to have a negative moderation effect on the relationship between policy participation and firm performance. Hence the more efficient a firm is in inventory and associated operational efficiencies, the lesser the benefits realized from policy participation. However, production and marketing resource efficiencies are not found to have significant effect as moderating variables.","Woo D., Suresh N.C.","Voluntary agreements for sustainability, resource efficiency & firm performance under the supply chain cooperation policy in South Korea",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134779549&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2022.108563&partnerID=40&md5=fe8b88596cde16d7a9ab700d8666a5f6
Sustainability (Switzerland),"This study analyzes the impact of different government subsidies on supply chain members under the low-carbon policy. Using the theory and the Stackelberg game method, we derive the equilibrium decision of diverse government subsidy models on the carbon emission reduction efforts and marketing efforts of supply chain members when manufacturers are dominant. We found that government subsidies positively influenced the carbon emission reduction efforts and marketing efforts of supply chain members and could increase the overall profit of the supply chain and the overall welfare of society. Meanwhile, social welfare increased first and then decreased with the subsidy, and there was a maximum value. Within a certain threshold, when the market demand was sensitive to carbon emission reduction efforts, it was more beneficial to subsidize manufacturers, and when it was sensitive to marketing efforts, subsidizing retailers was more beneficial. Regardless of the subsidy situation, an optimal subsidy rate exists among supply chain members. Meanwhile, adjusting government subsidy measures can decrease the profit gap between supply chain members, and it provides potential possibilities for cooperation among supply chain members.","Yuan S., Li J., Su X.",Impact of Government Subsidy Strategies on Supply Chains Considering Carbon Emission Reduction and Marketing Efforts,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135423270&doi=10.3390%2fsu14053111&partnerID=40&md5=242f4d2408563c950c436d124857bfb6

Fingermarks on five porous substrates were treated using IND-Zn formulations operationally used by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), UK Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST), and German Bundeskriminalamt (BKA). Despite the variations in composition, primarily associated with the difference in the carrier solvents, all three formulations gave similar sensitivity. However, the BKA formulation was identified as the most effective in consideration of cost and supply chain issues, that could be adopted for use in resource-limited micro-jurisdictions with minimum modification. Further experiments indicated that ethanol as a substitute co-solvent to methanol did not significantly reduce sensitivity, hence, could provide a safer modification of the CAST formulation used in other regions.

Computers and Industrial Engineering,"This study deals with the dynamic interactions between seaports and decision-making strategy for seaport operations by utilizing four-dimensional fractional Lotka-Volterra competition model under frequently disrupted by time-delay factor. Nonlinear analysis methods, including equilibrium analysis, stability evaluation, and time series investigation, are intensely explored to describe the cooperation and competition dynamics in maritime logistics. The dynamical analysis indicates that the port competition system shows a complex and highly nonlinear behaviour, notably illustrating unstable equilibria and even chaotic phenomena. Besides, nonlinear dynamical interactions in seaport management have been analysed by exploiting fractional calculus (FC) and system dynamics theory. Novel multi-criteria decision-making strategies realized by the neural network prediction controller (NNC) and adaptive fractional-order super-twisting sliding mode control (AFOSTSM) have been presented for dealing with throughput dynamics under parametric perturbations and external disturbances. Particularly, the active control algorithms are implemented to ensure the recovery strategy for throughput growth of Vietnam ports in the post-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic era. The case study has confirmed the efficacy of the proposed strategy by using system dynamics and control theory. The simulation results show that the average growth rates of container throughput can be ensured up to 7.46% by exploiting resilience management scheme. The presented method can be also utilized for providing managerial insights and solutions on efficient port operations.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"This study develops a novel mathematical model to design a sustainable mask Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network (CLSCN) during the COVID-19 outbreak for the first time. A multi-objective Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is proposed to address the locational, supply, production, distribution, collection, quarantine, recycling, reuse, and disposal decisions within a multi-period multi-echelon multi-product supply chain. Additionally, sustainable development is studied in terms of minimizing the total cost, total pollution and total human risk at the same time. Since the CLSCN design is an NP-hard problem, Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimization (MOGWO) algorithm and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are implemented to solve the proposed model and to find Pareto optimal solutions. Since Meta-heuristic algorithms are sensitive to their input parameters, the Taguchi design method is applied to tune and control the parameters. Then, a comparison is performed using four assessment metrics including Max-Spread, Spread of Non-Dominance Solution (SNS), Number of Pareto Solutions (NPS), and Mean Ideal Distance (MID). Additionally, a statistical test is employed to evaluate the quality of the obtained Pareto frontier by the presented algorithms. The obtained results reveal that the MOGWO algorithm is more reliable to tackle the problem such that it is about 25% superior to NSGA-II in terms of the dispersion of Pareto solutions and about 2% superior in terms of the solution quality. To validate the proposed mathematical model and testing its applicability, a real case study in Tehran/Iran is investigated as well as a set of sensitivity analyses on important parameters.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"This study develops a vaccine supply chain (VSC) to ensure sustainable distribution during a global crisis in a developing economy. In this study, a multi-objective mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is formulated to develop the VSC, ensuring the entire network's economic performance.

The shelf-life of vaccines and the uncertainty associated with demand and supply chain (SC) parameters are also considered in this study to ensure the robustness of the model. To solve the model, two recently developed metaheuristics—namely, the multi-objective social engineering optimizer (MOSEO) and multi-objective feasibility enhanced particle swarm optimization (MOFEPSO) methods—are used, and their results are compared.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"This study develops and tests a novel product quality framework for food supply chains (FSCs) that addresses sustainability. Issues including climate change, population growth, and the resources required by industrialized agriculture, as well as changing consumer preferences contribute to concerns about the social, ecological, and economic sustainability of FSCs. FSCs, therefore, need to be adapted to address changing supply and demand characteristics. We integrate the natural resource-based view (NRBV) with convention theory (CT) to develop a new set of quality dimensions. Placing social and ecological considerations within the domain of quality management advances theory in two ways. First, while social and ecological considerations are typically peripheral to business models, this framework allows social responsibility and the natural environment to occupy a central place within FSC operations. Second, the framework reflects the fundamentally socially embedded nature of FSCs, including the geographic, historical, and cultural associations of food quality. We then construct a typology of quality conventions and FSCs. We empirically test the typology using a case study methodology with cases from the United States of America (USA). The analysis explores how firms bundle quality conventions across FSCs for competitive advantage. We also find a set of paths through which FSCs transition via exploitation, exploration and organizational ambidexterity to generate competitive advantage, highlighting tradeoffs that may arise as FSCs evolve. These tradeoffs, which relate to maintaining or adapting quality conventions, are practically important because, if not managed appropriately, may result in lower performance and less sustainable FSCs.","Johnson-Hall T.D., Hall D.C.",Redefining Quality in Food Supply Chains via the Natural Resource Based View and Convention Theory,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137028972&doi=10.3390%2fsu14159456&partnerID=40&md5=806edfd6ffebf57265cb7953efb9c606
Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,"This study examined logistics planning in the modular integrated construction supply chain (MiC-SC). Existing models overlook two important characteristics of the MiC-SC-the dynamic behavior of its stakeholders, and the uncertain interactions between its activities and resources-making their applicability limited in real practice. The literature also lacks an understanding of which logistics and construction decisions significantly impact the MiC-SC key performance indicators (KPIs) (e.g., project duration, MiC-SC costs, and emissions). Moreover, optimizing logistics and construction decisions to achieve a trade-off between these KPIs is yet to be addressed. This study contributes to the MiC-SC knowledge by (1) developing a multimethod simulation model that captures the dynamic behavior of MiC-SC stakeholders through agent-based modeling and the uncertain interactions between their internal activities and resources using discrete-event simulation and considering more realistic features such as traffic condition, site layout, heterogeneous truck types, and uncertainty of activities duration; (2) integrating the developed model with the Taguchi approach (TA) to identify the significant logistics and construction decisions that impact five KPIs (project duration, construction costs, construction emissions, logistics costs, and logistics emissions); and (3) applying a simulation-optimization (SO) approach to find the near-optimum logistics and construction decisions that maximize the MiC-SC sustainability through minimizing the project duration, total costs, and carbon emissions. The model's applicability was demonstrated using a case study of a high-rise MiC project.

Process Integration and Optimization for Sustainability,"This study examines the impacts of sustainability investment and carbon policies in a two-level supply chain for a single product under classical and vendor-managed inventory schemes. Further, we classify the effects of carbon taxation, cap and trade, and limited carbon emission policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although the fundamental purpose of cap and trade is to minimize the carbon emission, a well-structured emission trading system can also provide considerable environmental, economic, and social advantages. The energy consumption is classified by the production and reworking process. The proposed model determines the optimal order quantity under various carbon emission rules. The sustainability investment is a financial activity that deals with projects or areas focused on environmental and natural resource protection, as well as the development of alternative energy sources. It also desires to reduce the use of fossil fuels and carbon emission. The results show that the total cost is less in limited carbon emission policies than carbon tax and cap and trade policies. Moreover, the total cost is less in vendor-managed inventory scheme compared to the classical method.

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"This study examines two pharmaceutical supply chains (PSCs) under the product life cycle and marketing strategies for the first time. Nash equilibrium between PSCs is based on marketing mix factors (i.e., price, the value provided by the value chain, availability, and promotion) at different periods of product life (i.e., introduction, growth, and maturity). Considering the previous step’s outputs, environmental protection, and sustainable development, this study provides a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model (MOMINLP) for the design of PSCs to minimize environmental pollution and maximize profit, consumer health level, and brand equity. At this stage of the network design, disruption issues in the manufacturer, distributor, and retailer are considered. Based on the value from the value chain in different periods of product life, different scenarios are considered. Optimizing the supply chain network design (SCND) under uncertainty through the reliability and Six Sigma concepts is examined. The proposed approach is validated with a real-case study in Iran. The results show that the brand equity, pollution created, and supply chain profits decrease with increasing optimization levels. However, the level of consumer health rises with increasing levels of optimization.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"This study explores drivers of supply chain sustainability during COVID-19 in both the Australian and Saudi Arabian fashion industries. COVID-19 is the most recent global crisis to amplify sustainability issues in a very polluting sector. This qualitative, comparative study draws on 44 semi-structured interviews with fashion brands across the fashion spectrum, evenly distributed between Australia and Saudi Arabia. A grounded approach to analysis was applied. Findings indicate reactive and proactive approaches to dealing with COVID-19 and its impacts. A reactive approach, or dealing with a situation when faced with it, is guided by isomorphic pressures, which are classified as external forces that shape and influence how an organisation operates within society, but also can lead to changes in internal practices. A proactive approach implies foresight and acts upon a situation prior to being ‘forced’ to make changes and encourages social sustainability along the supply chain. To overcome challenges intensified by the pandemic, fashion organisations need to increase flexibility and collaborative approaches. This study makes a novel contribution to the literature through its cross-cultural comparison, exploring sustainability drivers with institutional theory.","Alblowi R., Brydges T., Henninger C.E., Heinze L., Retamal M., Parker-Strak R., Blazquez M.",Exploring supply chain sustainability drivers during COVID-19- Tale of 2 cities,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137259369&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2022.133956&partnerID=40&md5=864723b7629d9389fe4d08d967a83aea
International Journal of Production Economics,"This study explores the effect of negative news about an organization on its sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices. We focus on how public reports about controversial business practices motivate a company to make adjustments so that environmental and social concerns are better included in its supply chain management practices. Using agenda-setting theory, we identify managerial commitment as an important factor in transmitting external media pressure. We analyse longitudinal data, ranging from 2002 through 2014 and collected for more than 700 US-based corporations. Our findings reveal that companies significantly increase SSCM after being the subject of negative news, particularly when management commitment to environmental sustainability and social welfare is high. Our findings should encourage supply chain decision makers to consider more broadly how external stakeholders view their global supply chain operations. Our research sheds light on negative news as an external factor; previous literature used media attention as anecdotal evidence and focused more on internal company factors. We contribute to research in SSCM by studying the mediation effect. It is essential that supply chain decision makers better apprehend the importance of negative news, management commitment, and SSCM and understand their role in influencing public opinion.","Damberg S.V., Hartmann J., Heese H.S.",Does bad press help or hinder sustainable supply chain management?

Sustainability (Switzerland),"This study explores the relationship between cloud platforms, logistics operations, and sustainable development across organizational boundaries. In the past research of scholars, there is a blank area in research on the correlation between cloud platform systems, logistics services, and sustainable development. Therefore, we took international logistics as an example, selected the customers of a cloud logistics platform in the Taiwan business network as the research object, conducted a sample survey on customers in their partner transactions, and used a structured questionnaire to collect primary data through the Internet, sending out 620 questionnaires with a total of 271 valid samples recovered. The recovery rate of good models was 43.7%. This study used SPSS and AMOS tools to analyze and test the research hypotheses. Through the empirical research results, it was found that: (1) the cloud platform was highly correlated with sustainable enterprise development (0.254); (2) the cloud platform was positively associated with logistics operations (0.837); and (3) the cloud platform, logistics operations, and organizational sustainability highly correlated (0.666). According to an empirical analysis, environmental protection proved to be the most important, followed by economic benefits, and social harmony benefits were slightly less correlated but also positively correlated. Our research found that the research and analysis of cloud-platform-related data are conducive to reducing operational risks and increasing opportunities for innovative service models. Using the service model operated by the cloud logistics platform, it is easier for enterprises to establish and maintain stable cooperative relations with external partners. Supply chain information transactions are transparent, and novel ideas and needs can be easily and quickly obtained, improving managers’ decision-making and business performances, significantly improving customer service satisfaction, and gradually achieving sustainable development in the three dimensions of economy, society, and environment, as well as making critical academic contributions to application and integration in environmental and social fields.","Yu W.-H., Chiou C.-C.",Effects of Sustainable Development of the Logistics Industry by Cloud Operational System,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137691791&doi=10.3390%2fsu141610440&partnerID=40&md5=7e1b0e7a26150781d5d5926df6cc2a1e

An empirical framework proposed in which presence of SCRs influences use of DMS during peak and lean demand. The empirical tests using Structured Equation Modelling approach (SEM) is carried out based on data from survey of 439 services businesses in India covering 10 services industry groups. The results demonstrate contingent relationship between SCRs and company performance and use of DMS as mediator.

International Journal of Production Research,"This study extends research on buyer firm roles in improving supplier sustainability practices by considering institutions–norms and rules–in the organisational field in which suppliers and sub-suppliers operate, exerting pressures on these actors to align their respectivepractices. We introducethe resource-based view to arrive at a framework outlining key capabilities for institutional entrepreneurs that seek institutionalisation of corporate sustainability standards (CSS) as a new institution across a multi-tier supply chain. The paper draws on the results of an exploratory research study using six comparative case studies within four industries. While institutional entrepreneurship explains how organisations drive institutional change, the resource-based view outlines criteria for organisational capabilities enabling the focal firm to achieve the targeted institutional change. Our analysis suggests five key capabilities enabling a buying firm to effectively institutionalise their requirements in multi-tier supply chains: (1) inter-firm dialogue, (2) risk management, (3) external stakeholder collaboration, (4) cross-functional integration, and (5) continuous improvement. The key organisational capabilities identified help to extend the theory of institutional entrepreneurship with concepts that facilitate institutional change in multi-tier supply chains with respect to corporate sustainability.

European Journal of Forest Research,"This study focuses on the development, implementation and application of a spatial-based decision support tool—named r.forcircular—aimed at quantifying both the level of the circular bioeconomy and the financial performance in the forest-based sector. The methodology merges a set of indicators based on the 4R framework (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover) of circular economy in a multicriteria approach. Outputs are computed for different scenarios and are calibrated based on variations in the selling price of raw materials and on higher mechanisation of production process phases (felling, processing, extraction and chipping of wood residues). The increase in wood assortment value leads to an improvement in the sustainability of the forest-wood supply chain in circular bioeconomy and financial terms. The application of a higher level of mechanisation seems to have conflicting results compared to those of other scenarios. The r.forcircular model was tested in an Italian case study (in the Municipality Union of Valdarno and Valdisieve in the Tuscany region, Italy) with the aim of understanding its applicability and replicability in other contexts. The results of the test showed that, in the study area, superior outcomes were observed for high forests than for coppices due to the low value of wood products obtainable from coppices.","Sacchelli S., Geri F., Becagli C., Bianchetto E., Casagli A., De Meo I., Paletto A.",A geography-based decision support tool to quantify the circular bioeconomy and financial performance in the forest-based sector (r.forcircular),https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139246980&doi=10.1007%2fs10342-022-01483-3&partnerID=40&md5=1c4ab062c2e8fdb844834639c4d0d3dd
Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,"This study focuses on the environmental and economic aspects of sustainability by establishing a supply chain including the collector, cleaner, and recycler for recycling PET plastic bottles and reusing them in textile industry. In the market, some suppliers of textile industry purchase the cleaned and non-fragmented bottles and afterward they fragment them, whereas others prefer to buy the recycled materials (the cleaned and fragmented bottles). The collector collects used plastic bottles. To meet demand for the recycled materials, he transfers a portion of the collected bottles to the recycler for cleaning and fragmenting them. Furthermore, the collector cleans another portion himself or via a cleaner to satisfy demand for the cleaned and non-fragmented bottles. In this setting, two different structures are considered for transferring the cleaned bottles to suppliers. Under the first structure, the collector delegates the collected bottles to the cleaner by giving a share of the profit to him, while he is equipped with bottle cleaning technology by paying a setup cost under the second structure. It is investigated how this conflict affects the interactions established among these members. To do so, the game theory is applied including Nash, Stackelberg, and Centralized models to make decisions under these structures. The results indicate that it is profitable for the collector to establish bottle cleaning technology himself, if its setup cost is lower than a threshold. Moreover, from the whole system’s perspective, it is beneficial to clean the collected bottles through the cleaner by providing an incentive to him.

Expert Systems with Applications,"This study introduces a fuzzy bi-level Decision Support System (DSS) to optimize a sustainable multi-level multi-product Supply Chain (SC) and co-modal transportation network for perishable products distribution. To this end, two integrated multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models are proposed to formulate the problem.

This model is participatory and flexible and allows small farmers to benefit from achieving economies of scale by organizing themselves into groups and synchronizing and harmonizing selected operations. It was piloted in two villages of Odisha, an eastern Indian state, with 112 farmers (35 females and 77 males). These farmers organized themselves into groups and synchronized their operations such as nursery bed management, transplanting, and harvesting collectively to achieve economies of scale. The SFLF farmers purchased inputs (seed and fertilizer) and sold paddy as a group to increase their bargaining power in price negotiations. The results from this pilot study showed that the participating farmers almost doubled their profits. Apart from the monetary benefits, these farmers saved time in many joint activities, including input (seed and fertilizer) purchase, paddy sale, and nursery bed management.

Sugar Tech,"This study presents a literature review of the main advances that took place in the last 10 years in the agricultural production of sugarcane in Brazil, which can effectively result in increased productivity and sustainability. This became a central topic as much of this crop in Brazilian is used to produce ethanol to replace fossil fuels; therefore, the increased concerns about global warming and climate change, and the greater pressure from society for sustainability in agriculture in general became more relevant for sugarcane. Actions have been taken to encourage the use of more conservationist practices from planting to harvesting, greater recycling of residues, preservation of biodiversity, delivery of environmental services, adoption of circular economy and, especially, compliance with internal and external commitments on reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, among other aspects. Fertilizer recommendations have been revised to increase yields and ratoon longevity, leading to higher rates of micronutrients and the more frequent application of lime, phosphogypsum, and P fertilizers in ratoons. Optimized use of vinasse includes addition of mineral fertilizers to save field operations for separate fertilization. The sugarcane breeding programs in Brazil are releasing an average of eight varieties per year, including transgenic varieties. Replanting of sugarcane fields with newer and more productive varieties are facilitated by novel planting methods using pre-sprouted settlings (PSS) combined with the nurseries mingled into the crop renewal fields, locally termed “MEIOSI,” which also allow the easy introduction of rotation crops. Soil compaction and ratoon trampling caused by heavy machines that replaced manual harvesting are being solved with GPS-based traffic control, which is embedded in most farming equipment in the sugarcane sector nowadays. Finally, public policies, such as the Renovabio legislation, incentivizing the production of sugarcane/ethanol with low GHG emissions are also in place. With this, the sugarcane industry is revising all field and industrial procedures to optimize operations and earn more decarbonization credits, in a win–win situation. The combined efforts of research institutions and the private sector, along with the proper policies, have the potential to lead toward a renewed and more sustainable sugarcane industry.","Rossetto R., Ramos N.P., de Matos Pires R.C., Xavier M.A., Cantarella H., Guimarães de Andrade Landell M.",Sustainability in Sugarcane Supply Chain in Brazil: Issues and Way Forward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130479606&doi=10.1007%2fs12355-022-01170-y&partnerID=40&md5=852869b15d49e6b2f9f0c898d8c15e30
Sustainability (Switzerland),"This study presents an operational analysis to determine the location of an intermediate hub in a supply network for the mining industry, incorporating sustainability criteria through an optimization model. The sector of small, medium, and artisan mining enterprises (PAMMA), in Chile, has the same pressure as large mining to meet the demands of sustainability in the medium term, but the network of PAMMA facilities is precarious and requires government support for development. One strategy to improve the supply network is to locate intermediate points with limited capacities (called purchasing powers) to help the viability of the business model by incorporating sustainability objectives, such as diminishing the movement of minerals, as well as reducing the carbon footprint and gas emissions, all in support the promotion of the activity of small miners. In order to achieve the strategy above, a mathematical model of location and sustainable capacity is proposed. A grouping of suppliers was carried out to establish the number of mining suppliers in each cluster and the location of the intermediate hubs. Then, the prioritization of the parameters and classification of the processing plant alternatives was performed to define a vector of weights to rank the degree of sustainability. A sustainability matrix was calculated on the basis of the distances and transportation costs between the supplier hubs of the supply network and the processing plants. With each of these factors, a capacity model was developed to validate the mineral process flows in the supply network and estimate the expected productivity levels. The model is intended to support operational decision making when determining the location of an intermediate purchasing power that reduces the impact of transportation costs and emissions. The model was applied in a case study of the supply network in the small mining sector in Chile. The results recommend the location of hubs to add value and encourage investment in the PAMMA supply network.","Barraza R., Sepúlveda J.M., Derpich I.",Location of the Intermediate Echelon to Add Purchase Value and Sustainability Criteria in a Mining Supply Network,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139938578&doi=10.3390%2fsu141912920&partnerID=40&md5=275cce999dc6fe0c9bcc070dbbf30a1c
Sustainability (Switzerland),"This study proposes a BOPS (buy online and pick up in store) model for a two-echelon supply chain, considering the product return risk to reach an equilibrium result of two omni-channel integration modes, managed by the manufacturer or the retailer, respectively. Furthermore, this study analyzes the impacts of the service cost coefficient and the consumer loyalty of the offline channel on the optimal price, service decision, and profit of different integration modes. This study also compares the profits of enterprises under centralized and decentralized decisions. The results show that centralized decision making can improve the service level of the SA (Store Assistance) effort and the sustainable performance of the supply chain. Whether the BOPS channel is managed by the manufacturer or retailer, the service cost, the product return rate, and the offline channel consumer loyalty have an impact on the decision of product sale price, wholesale price, and SA effort service level. Offline customer loyalty is less sensitive in the BOPS channel managed by the retailer than that managed by the manufacturer. It is suitable for the manufacturer to manage the BOPS channel when offline customer loyalty is low. Otherwise, it is appropriate for the retailer to manage the BOPS channel. The profit of the supply chain under the decentralized decision is less than that under the centralized decision. When executing a wholesale price contract, different omni-channel integration modes can alleviate the double marginalization effect. It can fully coordinate the supply chain members, motivate retailers to improve the service level of the SA effort, and realize Pareto improvement to support supply chain sustainability.","Yang S., Lai I.K.W., Tang H.",Pricing and Contract Coordination of BOPS Supply Chain Considering Product Return Risk,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129101157&doi=10.3390%2fsu14095055&partnerID=40&md5=33060ad074d3ec8fc74fd84666f813b9
Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,"This study proposes a framework for the main parties of a sustainable supply chain network considering lot-sizing impact with quantity discounts under disruption risk among the first studies. The proposed problem differs from most studies considering supplier selection and order allocation in this area. First, regarding the concept of the triple bottom line, total cost, environmental emissions, and job opportunities are considered to cover the criteria of sustainability. Second, the application of this supply chain network is transformer production. Third, applying an economic order quantity model lets our model have a smart inventory plan to control the uncertainties. Most significantly, we present both centralized and decentralized optimization models to cope with the considered problem. The proposed centralized model focuses on pricing and inventory decisions of a supply chain network with a focus on supplier selection and order allocation parts. This model is formulated by a scenario-based stochastic mixed-integer non-linear programming approach. Our second model focuses on the competition of suppliers based on the price of products with regard to sustainability. In this regard, a Stackelberg game model is developed. Based on this comparison, we can see that the sum of the costs for both levels is lower than the cost without the bi-level approach. However, the computational time for the bi-level approach is more than for the centralized model. This means that the proposed optimization model can better solve our problem to achieve a better solution than the centralized optimization model. However, obtaining this better answer also requires more processing time. To address both optimization models, a hybrid bio-inspired metaheuristic as the hybrid of imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized. The proposed algorithm is compared with its individuals. All employed optimizers have been tuned by the Taguchi method and validated by an exact solver in small sizes. Numerical results show that striking similarities are observed between the results of the algorithms, but the standard deviations of PSO and ICA–PSO show better behavior. Furthermore, while PSO consumes less time among the metaheuristics, the proposed hybrid metaheuristic named ICA–PSO shows more time computations in all small instances. Finally, the provided results confirm the efficiency and the performance of the proposed framework and the proposed hybrid metaheuristic algorithm.","Rafigh P., Akbari A.A., Bidhandi H.M., Kashan A.H.",A sustainable supply chain network considering lot sizing with quantity discounts under disruption risks: centralized and decentralized models,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137061026&doi=10.1007%2fs10878-022-00891-w&partnerID=40&md5=989ac45672f352ef624e32ba58ef69c1
Chemical Engineering Research and Design,"This study proposes a multi-objective mathematical programming model to design an oil supply chain network at three levels: upstream, midstream and downstream. It includes oil wells, gas injection wells, production units, refineries, gas injection centers, distribution centers, export and import terminals. The proposed model optimizes all three economic, social and environmental goals at the same time. Drilling injection and production wells, transportation costs, production costs, gas injection center costs, as well as fixed and annual costs of refineries and distribution centers are all minimized in the economic dimension. The environmental dimension of sustainability reduces greenhouse gas emissions, while the social dimension of sustainability increases job opportunities. The optimization of associated petroleum gas injection operations into the reservoir is also taken into account in this study. The proposed model considers the uncertainty of critical parameters and employs a robust possibilistic hybrid approach to deal with it, as well as an interactive fuzzy approach to solve it. A case study in Iran is used to evaluate the suggested model's performance. In comparison to the single-objective economic model, the results of solving the model show that taking sustainability into account has reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increased job opportunities. The crude oil extraction potential increases in each period when gas injection optimization and reservoir pressure are taken into account. Furthermore, the cost of the supply chain grows as the amount of uncertainty in the suggested model rises. As a result, the uncertainty of system parameters must be considered.","Ghatee A., Zarrinpoor N.",Designing an oil supply chain network considering sustainable development paradigm and uncertainty,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133908491&doi=10.1016%2fj.cherd.2022.06.026&partnerID=40&md5=186d454761f791b6b6a3951f6adb0e38
Energy Conversion and Management,"This study proposes an advanced natural gas liquefaction process by applying liquid air to the propane pre-cooled mixed refrigerant (C3MR) process. Being the most efficient process, the C3MR process has the largest market share in the natural gas liquefaction industry. The proposed concept involves recovering cold energy released by liquefied natural gas (LNG) by introducing liquid air as the recovery medium, in which the natural gas liquefaction and LNG regasification stages are integrated. The proposed C3MR-liquid air (C3MR-LA) process was optimized using a genetic algorithm for four different process configurations. The best design produced 737.41 kJ/kg-LNG for natural gas liquefaction, which is 26.4% less than in the optimized commercial C3MR process. In addition, a techno-economic analysis is conducted, and the results show that 25.1% of expenses could be saved through energy recovery by applying liquid air. By including liquid air in the LNG supply chain, the developed process achieves superior performance from both the energy and economic perspectives. A thermodynamic analysis shows that the newly proposed process can reduce exergy waste by 21.0% over the entire LNG supply chain compared to existing technology. Overall, this study proposes an attractive process model for natural gas liquefaction through cold energy recovery, which is expected to contribute to increasing the sustainability of the LNG industry.","Park J., Mun H., Kim J., Lee I.",Advanced natural gas liquefaction process on LNG supply chain with liquid air: From design to thermodynamic and techno-economic analyses,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120966746&doi=10.1016%2fj.enconman.2021.115107&partnerID=40&md5=2bcbb24db4ad979659af87b907eb6cff
International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,"This study sheds light on the Hydrogen technology in transportation for reaching the sustainability goals of societies, illustrated by the case of Mexico. In terms of the affected supply chains the study explores how the packaging and distribution of a fuel-saving tool that allows the adoption of hydrogen as complementary energy for maritime transportation to improve economic and environmental performance in Mexico. This exploratory study performs interviews, observations, simulations, and tests involving producers, suppliers, and users at 26 ports in Mexico. The study shows that environmental and economic performance are related to key processes in Supply Chain Management (SCM) in which packaging and distribution are critical for achieving logistics and transportation sustainability goals. Reusable packaging and the distribution of a fuel-saving tool can help decrease costs -, of transport, and downstream/upstream processes in SCM while at the same time increasing the environmental performance.","Elvira K., Marisol R., Susanne H., Leif-Magnus J., Sandoval-Pineda J.M., de G G.-H.R.",Hydrogen technology for supply chain sustainability: The Mexican transportation impacts on society,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127370413&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhydene.2022.03.081&partnerID=40&md5=57c267512ff72b922bdebeb7bb6466e1
Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"This study systematically reviews 127 papers on sustainable supply chain management in the textile and apparel (T&A) industry. Gaps and trends in related research are determined in a content analysis according to structural dimensions and analytic categories of research method, supply chain management and sustainability and also risk and performance. We observe a methodological focus on empirical research and a geographical one on (South) East Asia. We find a balance between intra- and inter-organizational studies and between studies on financial and reputational impacts. Assessments of environmental risks and green performance dominate over social factors. A contingency analysis reveals that the management of economic risks on the one hand and non-economic, i.e. environmental and social ones, on the other hand is disjoint. The two topics show hardly any integration with each other.

Computers and Industrial Engineering,"This work aims to develop a decision support tool for optimizing the traceability in a supply chain (SC) of meat products considering economic and environmental concerns. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model that seeks to minimize three objectives simultaneously: total batch dispersion, operating costs, and carbon emissions of the network. This model is solved by applying a Goal Programming approach that minimizes the undesirable deviations from the goals. The advantages of the posed formulation are illustrated through its application to a case study in which trade-offs exist among the performance indicators of the meat SC. Results show the formulation constitutes a valuable instrument for selecting the involved actors in the SC, planning the production and distribution of produced batches, and identifying the batches of animals that form each finished product batch delivered to every retailer, thus allowing their traceability.","Schmidt B.V., Moreno M.S.",Traceability optimization in the meat supply chain with economic and environmental considerations,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131396870&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2022.108271&partnerID=40&md5=40baa3b15f03a011748e3acd143c9bd9
Sustainability (Switzerland),"This work is a unique integration of three different areas, including smart eye status monitoring, supply chain operations reference (SCOR), and system dynamics, to explore the dynamics of the supply chain network of smart eye/vision monitoring systems. Chronic eye diseases such as glaucoma affect millions of individuals worldwide and, if left untreated, can lead to irreversible vision loss. Nearly half of the affected population is unaware of the condition and can be informed with frequent, accessible eye/vision tests. Tonometry is the conventional clinical method used in healthcare settings to determine the intraocular pressure (IOP) level for evaluating the risk of glaucoma. There are currently very few (under development) non-contact and non-invasive methods using smartphones to determine the risk of IOP and/or the existence of other eye-related diseases conveniently at home. With the overall goal of improving health, well-being, and sustainability, this paper proposes Eye-SCOR: a supply chain operations reference (SCOR)-based framework to evaluate the effectiveness of smartphone-based eye status monitoring apps. The proposed framework is designed using system dynamics modeling as a subset of a new causal model. The model includes interaction/activities between the main players and enablers in the supply chain network, namely suppliers/service providers, smartphone app/device factors, customers, and healthcare professionals, as well as cash and information flow. The model has been tested under various scenarios and settings. Simulation results reveal the dynamics of the model and show that improving the eye status monitoring device/app factors directly increases the efficiency/Eye-SCOR level. The proposed framework serves as an important step towards understanding and improving the overall performance of the supply chain network of smart eye/vision monitoring systems.","Pourreza S., Faezipour M., Faezipour M.",Eye-SCOR: A Supply Chain Operations Reference-Based Framework for Smart Eye Status Monitoring Using System Dynamics Modeling,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136442397&doi=10.3390%2fsu14148876&partnerID=40&md5=ad6ee8ba61013b945bbd175d3facb058

Process Integration and Optimization for Sustainability,"This work presents a multi-echelon, multi-period supply chain master planning in the process industry; with a concept of sustainability, carried out on a real-life case study located in Port Harcourt in the South–South region of Nigeria. A supply chain master panning model (SCMPM) takes into account the most effective and efficient method to fulfil customer order and demand over a mid-term planning horizon; it also takes of bottlenecks by assigning demands to production. A mixed integer, multi-objective optimization deterministic model was formulated which aimed at minimizing the overall system costs, emissions, social factors and customers order fulfilment in the supply chain. The Cplex solver of GAMS, with branch and cut algorithm, was used on an Intel processor with 2.30 GHz speed to run the model. The results obtained from the model with real industry data from the case study gave the objective function values as 324, 854, 340 Naira for economic factor, 26.455 tonnes of CO2 emission (170.50 g CO2), for environmental factor, while those of the social factor and allowable backorder gave 10.433 and 105 units of product, respectively. The results showed the feasibility of the formulated models and the importance to have an effective master planning supply chain decision model in place. A significant correlation between four conflicting objectives was achieved by using the weighted-sum approach and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) thereby converting them to a single linear optimization model.","David D.U., Aikhuele D.O., Ughehe P.O., Tamuno E.M.","Multi-echelon, Multi-period Supply Chain Master Planning in the Food Process Industry: A Sustainability Concept",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125397298&doi=10.1007%2fs41660-022-00229-3&partnerID=40&md5=c44052a917833afa7e24ee80c5e12d64
Food Reviews International,"Three-dimensional printing can be successfully applied in the food sector to fabricate 3D foods with complex geometries, customized texture, and tailored nutritional contents. The concrete application of 3D printing to foods began in the early 2000 s. This work is aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of 3D printed foods. Details and issues concerning ingredients and technologies available for 3D food printing are supplied as well as the discussion of aspects such as nutritional values, safety, acceptability, sustainability, and legal framework of 3D printed foods. The main 3D food applications are based on the extrusion technology and concern natively printable materials such as cereal derivatives and chocolate. However, interesting applications concern alternative ingredients such as proteins and fibres isolated from insects, algae, microorganisms, and agri-food residues. Microbiological contamination and migration of toxic substances from printer elements can occur, but effective cleaning protocols and the use of materials authorized to come into contact with foods guarantee the necessary safety standards. A serious issue concerns acceptability of 3D printed foods, since it is greatly affected by their unusual appearance. From a legal point of view, 3D printed foods should be considered as “novel foods”. 3D food printing should be considered an opportunity for the development of new business strategies as well as a way to increase the food supply chain sustainability.

Palgrave Advances in Luxury,"Through an ethnographic survey of Italian ethical jewelers and representative customers, this study focuses on how the topic of traceability in the Canadian diamond industry is communicated and negotiated within two representative Italian ethical jewelry stores in Milan and Bologna. To better understand communication strategies deployed by jewelers to convey the concepts of ethical jewelry, the authors explore themes related to traceability in the context of Canadian ethical diamonds (CEDs). A specific dominant narrative built around CEDs is identified that leverages customer concerns about the violation of the safety and human rights of workers on the diamond supply chain. To more deeply analyze how information about the traceability of CEDs successfully mitigates consumer concerns about the ethics of jewelry supply chains, the authors explore the role of identity obsession (Remotti, L’ossessione identitaria. Laterza, Rome, 2010) in ethical jewelry purchase decisions by Italian consumers. They further discuss rationales for the general resistance of many Italian jewelers to offering ethical jewelry in local stores, to better understand why, to date, ethical jewelry remains a niche market segment in Italy, with most Italian consumers unaware of the degrading environmental and sociological impact of such products as blood diamonds.","Armano L., Joy A.",Canadian Ethical Diamonds and Identity Obsession: How Consumers of Ethical Jewelry in Italy Understand Traceability,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136313192&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-06928-4_8&partnerID=40&md5=0a5dcd8e03e56365b5d98993a7482ba6
Microorganisms,"Through recent decades, the subtherapeutic use of antibiotics within agriculture has led to the widespread development of antimicrobial resistance. This problem not only impacts the productivity and sustainability of current agriculture but also has the potential to transfer antimicrobial resistance to human pathogens via the food supply chain. An increasingly popular alternative to antibiotics is bacteriophages to control bacterial diseases. Their unique bactericidal properties make them an ideal alternative to antibiotics, as many countries begin to restrict the usage of antibiotics in agriculture. This review analyses recent evidence from within the past decade on the efficacy of phage therapy on common foodborne pathogens, namely, Escherica coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter jejuni.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"Throughout the world, including in developed countries, the COVID-19 crisis has revealed and accentuated food insecurity. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations clearly defines food security as a situation of not only availability and accessibility but also social acceptability (i.e., adequacy and sustainability). In developed countries, food security remains non-achieved at all. Notably, the so-called “little deprivation” leads the working poor to rely on food aid. We argue that even doing so, they remain food insecure: food aid is socially unacceptable because, despite their work, they are kept away from classical food access paths. In this article, we present the specificities of food aid in France and state some of its limits, namely those associated with the supply chain of donated foodstuffs. We propose a monographic study relying on a mix of firsthand material (six years of fieldwork from students with associations) and secondhand material (analysis of specialized, legal, and activity reports). We describe inspiring initiatives from three French associations and mobilize the recently published analysis of dignity construction in food aid in the United States of America to argue that dignity in food aid logistics is also a knowledge management and digital matter. Indeed, the initiatives of the three considered associations show concretely how knowledge management and digital systems can enhance dignity in food aid logistics.","Arduin P.-E., Saïdi-Kabeche D.",Dignity in Food Aid Logistics Is Also a Knowledge Management and Digital Matter: Three Inspiring Initiatives in France,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123070602&doi=10.3390%2fsu14031130&partnerID=40&md5=d5e8cd4fcf59687c82add0481f4ba8dc

A literature review has been conducted by using selected studies from reputed journals. It has been found that IoT applications in the sustainable agricultural supply chain and is currently under a nascent stage in developing countries. This is due to influence of multiple barriers, which poses serious problems, and therefore it is imperative for agricultural scientists and managers to understand the interrelationships.

Journal of Cleaner Production,"To address ongoing deforestation for global food commodities production, companies and governments have adopted a range of forest-focused supply chain policies. In the Brazilian Amazon, these policies take the form of market exclusion mechanisms, i.e., immediately dropping suppliers who have cleared their land after a specific cut-off date. Theory suggests that strict exclusionary policies such as these are likely to result in both negative livelihood effects and reduced effectiveness of the policy if some farmers are not able to comply. It is proposed that a more cooperative model of enforcement that uses flexible and negotiated approaches to compliance management may enable more marginal and disadvantaged farmers to achieve compliance, thereby improving both the effectiveness of supply chain policies and their equity. Through our case study of cattle in the Brazilian Amazon, we examine the degree to which a purportedly cooperative supply chain policy exhibits coercive tendencies at different tiers and the degree to which these tendencies influence effectiveness and equity outcomes of the policy. We show that, surprisingly, even cooperative models of enforcement are prone to exhibit coercive tendencies in multi-tier supply chains, leading to severe equity shortcomings. We provide recommendations and a research agenda to mitigate effectiveness-equity tradeoffs in multi-tier, forest-focused supply chain policies in the aim to improve the design, adoption, and implementation of such policies.","Cammelli F., Levy S.A., Grabs J., Valentim J.F., Garrett R.D.",Effectiveness-equity tradeoffs in enforcing exclusionary supply chain policies: Lessons from the Amazonian cattle sector,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121423932&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2021.130031&partnerID=40&md5=57eaeb6391571d2177029851e0442278
Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy,"To address the undesired environmental and social impacts of agricultural export production, the agricultural industry increasingly relies on sustainability standards. These standards neglect food security, although rights-based food security criteria were recently developed. This research analyses the responsibilities of global supply chain actors for the Right to Food and identifies a feasible implementation pathway to support the operationalization of these criteria.

Total Quality Management and Business Excellence,"To better implement sustainability initiatives in the Circular Economy (CE) age, benefiting of Total Quality Management (TQM) principles, the category of Social Enterprises (SE) manifests an enormous potential. Nonetheless, the above views have been lightly researched, providing research gaps in at least three areas: (1) TQM as an open model, expanded, and boundaryless that involves stakeholders in the value chain through value co-creation processes; (2) TQM and CE and (3) TQM and SE. Through this paper, we reconceptualize TQM with the lens of viable systems approach, CE and SE, while concluding with an illustrative case study and COVID-19 implications. Methodologically, we apply the inductive approach through the illustrative case of Patagonia by emphasizing also how COVID-19 influenced quality management and company-level circularity. This study revealed that the common denominator of TQM, CE and SE is the Triple Bottom Line (i.e. economic, social and environmental sustainability). Also, the concept of ‘value’ was another unifying notion, especially the value co-creation, social value and shared value.

International Journal of Production Research,"To formulate multi-tier supply chain management strategies with global impact, understanding the roles of various supply chain partners in disseminating sustainability along the supply chain is crucial. We analyze the influence of different supply chain positions on sustainability and financial outcomes of Turkish manufacturing companies listed in İstanbul Stock Exchange (BIST). We propose a sustainability measure, and rank firms according to their sustainability practices in relation to their financial outcomes using data envelopment analysis (DEA). We estimate Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) equations to control for the common financial shocks that can affect sustainability and financial outcomes simultaneously. Our analysis reveals that first-tier and sub-supplier (second-tier and lower-tiers) firms’ financial performance is substantially better compared to Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) firms while their sustainability outcomes stay behind. We find that this latter effect is more profound for first-tier firms. Although the supplier firms generally comply with the OEM’s product standards, our results show that they are not aligned with the OEM in terms of the environmental and social impact of their operations.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"To improve social welfare and the sustainable development index, many governments introduce subsidies to manufacturers. Motivated by a subsidy program, we present a parsimonious analysis to determine the impact of subsidies when two competing manufacturers use different distribution structures under competition to sell their products in a three-echelon distribution set-ting. The objective is to understand better how distribution structures and social welfare measures affect the government’s decision to subsidize. We consider four different distribution structures where the government can provide subsidies to both the manufacturers or one of them. From the perspective of the social welfare optimization goal, we consider two well-established measures to analyze whether those measures impacted the overall dynamics. The two key areas: (i) the effect of distribution structures and (ii) decisions under different social welfare measures are not discussed comprehensively yet. We found that distribution structure significantly impacted product qualities, prices, and amount of government expenditure. The government may need to pay more subsidies in a distribution structure with a two-manufacturers-two-distributors-two-retailers distribution setting, where customers can receive a higher-quality product and pay a higher price.

IEEE Access,"To improve the effectiveness and the sustainability of logistics, the Physical Internet paradigm proposes disruptive solutions. This implies developing an ecosystem of tech-based logistics solutions and supporting methodologies that enable all players in global trade to cooperate. The purpose of this paper is to investigate systematic literature review (SLR) studies to gain detailed insight into how innovative transport technologies, and digitalization initiatives around the Physical Internet development impact supply chains. This paper presents the results of a tertiary study that systematically identified more than twelve thousand articles and selects to review 74 secondary studies on the application of disruptive technologies and the Physical Internet initiative on supply chains from a management perspective. This is complementary to previous reviews, since no one provides a comprehensive and consolidated approach towards the relationship of these three fields. The five-stage systematic review process proposed by Denyer and Tranfield (2009) is followed. As a result, we identify the key activities, knowledge areas and strategies in the supply chain field where the Physical Internet and disruptive technologies interact and are game-changing. Also, we present a conceptual framework that summarises the relationships that exist between relevant disruptive technologies, the physical internet topics, and supply chain key activities. The framework is helpful for researchers and practitioners to find potential technologies to invest in, to assess the potential effects on companies of their implementation, and to support strategic decision-making. The paper concludes with an outlook on future research opportunities from operational, tactical, and strategic perspectives.","Cortes-Murcia D.L., Guerrero W.J., Montoya-Torres J.R.","Supply Chain Management, Game-Changing Technologies, and Physical Internet: A Systematic Meta-Review of Literature",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131716395&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2022.3181154&partnerID=40&md5=47645ad2bf3c7f0c6303049ded2f635c
Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"To integrate the location, inventory, and routing (LIR) problems arising in designing a resilient sustainable perishable food supply network (RSPFSN), a bi-objective optimization model is developed. To improve the resiliency and sustainability of the RSPFSN, a dynamic pricing strategy is used to cope with the disrupting events, along with minimizing the total cost and CO2 emission of the whole network. One of the important features of the proposed model is taking into account the effects of route disruptions and traffic conditions on the deterioration of products. To solve the mixed-integer nonlinear bi-objective optimization model, a novel hybrid method is developed using the Heuristic Multi-Choice Goal Programming and Utility Function Genetics Algorithm (HMCGP-UFGA). To improve resiliency, the dynamic pricing strategy, considering the traffic condition, can lead to around a 20% improvement in both cost and CO2 emission, based on the results of our case study in a dairy supply chain. Besides, the results of sensitivity analysis display the high flexibility of the proposed approach for various problems.","Abbasian M., Sazvar Z., Mohammadisiahroudi M.",A hybrid optimization method to design a sustainable resilient supply chain in a perishable food industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136544197&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-022-22115-8&partnerID=40&md5=a376699e897e4362f1ac7467dac2a388
Sustainability (Switzerland),"To manage the environmental impact of logistics, we considered a logistics service supply chain consisting of a fourth-party logistics company (4PL) and a third-party logistics company (3PL), where the 4PL deputed the 3PL with the logistics tasks of a client. We examined the investment and pricing strategies adopted by the 4PL for the 3PL, and how factors such as logistics audits level and commitment to investment efforts affected the motivation of the 4PL’s strategy choice. The results showed that if the investment cost was low, the 4PL motivated the 3PL to make efforts by investment. Otherwise, the 4PL incentivized the 3PL by providing a high wholesale price or using a high investment level and medium wholesale price. In addition, when the rectification costs of the 3PL were sufficiently high, increasing the audit level could improve the probability of complying with environmental regulations.","Wang H., Huang M., Wang H.",Fourth-Party Logistics Environmental Compliance Management: Investment and Logistics Audit,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137750672&doi=10.3390%2fsu141610106&partnerID=40&md5=af13cba795feada25bf9d1691a3cb66c
Journal of Hospital Management and Health Policy,"Today, healthcare must be willing to take risks while advancing clinical transformation, starting from research to innovations, patient care technicians to physicians, management thinking lean to maximizing inventory flow, building a supply chain of healthcare workers to allowing engineering strategies, and building community facilities to establishing remote reusable facilities. In recent months, the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19) has changed everyone’s perspective globally. The United States healthcare system is linked with financial needs. The stakeholders must understand the growth and possibility of the unforeseen new medical risks, including how to challenge the dataset used for decision making, increasing the required acceptance level for the verification and validation of growing medical risk models, because healthcare is a stochastic system, forecasting always changes and so does the final decision of investing the cost. The global fear brought on by the ongoing pandemic is playing a major role in the economic and social consequences. Experts recommend that physicians must be willing to take over the key roles and lead these strategies, but at the same time better integration of engineering fields can play a huge role in helping physicians to understand the strategies. It is very important to help them craft a solution that healthcare workers can stick to. In this article, we propose three key frameworks (viz., health surveillance, workforce, and modular facilities) that would be helpful in creating a balance within the healthcare industry daily operation which is the paramount need of the “new normal” and sustainability.","Khan A., Farooq A., Ahmad S., Fraser J.M.",Optimizing the complexities of unforeseen risk in healthcare with innovation and technology: a proposed framework,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127579603&doi=10.21037%2fJHMHP-21-3&partnerID=40&md5=3448f8da8c2d001dd948eec6ed21737e
"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","Today, sustainability has gained significant importance in supply chain management due to its strategic business advantages. Concurrently, industries are facing supply chain sustainability risks emanated from diversified sources. So far, however, literature is scarce regarding sustainability risk assessment. To fill this research gap, this paper presents a real-life case study of the textile industry to identify and quantify supply chain sustainability risks. In this paper, the fuzzy synthetic evaluation method is applied to compute the likelihood of occurrence, amount of impact, risk criticality of each risk factor group, and the total risk. This study finds five risk groups along with twenty sustainability risk factors. The risk groups are listed as ‘supplier’, ‘financial’, ‘social’, ‘transportation’, and ‘environmental’, based on their respective risk criticality values. The top three sustainability risk factors are ‘poor product transportation system’, ‘air, water, and soil pollution’, and ‘factory fire’. The overall risk criticality value of sustainability risks of the case industry is found as approximately high. An objective of this study is to guide practitioners to take the required strategic steps to assess and manage sustainability risks in their supply chains.","Raian S., Ali S.M., Sarker M.R., Sankaranarayanan B., Kabir G., Paul S.K., Chakrabortty R.K.",Assessing sustainability risks in the supply chain of the textile industry under uncertainty,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117588951&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2021.105975&partnerID=40&md5=e60c8322ff4ea9faa14f76f8b398e7b3
Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"Today, the world faces a big challenge about food quality and safety. Consumers are becoming more careful during their food choices, focusing on food information. Drawing on the Industry 4.0 technologies and methodologies, food companies could adopt traceability systems that are able to collect various types of information along the food supply chain, to satisfy regulation but also to make their work transparent. With the aim of overcoming the current shortcomings in the food traceability framework (e.g., the absence of data visualisation solutions or tools for supply chain actors and consumers, adopting standards for external traceability and data identification, and fulfilling the four Industry 4.0 development dimensions), and considering the sustainability challenges, the aim of this study is to suggest a Framework for Voluntary Food Traceability based on digital technologies and explore its application by means of a case study in an organic olive oil company. The Framework, composed of three building blocks, allows the company to: map supply chain processes, identifying tasks and processes where data was generated, its format and the supply chain owner; select and use technologies to collect and analyse traceability data; and communicate to the end consumer comprehensible and useful food information.","Latino M.E., Menegoli M., Lazoi M., Corallo A.",Voluntary traceability in food supply chain: a framework leading its implementation in Agriculture 4.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124599243&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2022.121564&partnerID=40&md5=fd07ed7d2ab9ce9d65973cff4f7ee22e
Mathematical Problems in Engineering,"Today, with the daily increase in population, the demand for agricultural and/or, in general, food products continuously raises and so does the natural resources consumption which induces challenges to the supply chain management of important food products. In the present study, drivers as well as barriers of the agriculture sustainable supply chain are identified and ranked with the help of multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. We identify six drivers and seven barriers with the help of experts' opinions in the field and apply ranking methods including TOPSIS-AHP, AHP, and COPRAS-AHP as well as Borda rule and Copeland method to merge the ratings. The results highlight that the economic dimension of sustainability is more important than the environmental and social dimension. Distrust of consumers, lack of understanding and awareness of managers, and performance appraisal problems were found to be the most important barriers. Furthermore, informing the community by the media, entering the global market, exporting products, and producing sustainable products as a competitive advantage were identified to be the most important drivers.

Foods,"Today’s consumers are increasingly aware of the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA in preventing, delaying, and intervening various diseases, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, depression, and many other ailments. The role of n-3 PUFA on aging and cognitive function is also one of the hot topics in basic research, product development, and clinical applications. For decades, n-3 PUFA, especially EPA and DHA, have been supplied by fish oil and seafood. With the continuous increase of global population, awareness about the health benefits of n-3 PUFA, and socioeconomic improvement worldwide, the supply chain is facing increasing challenges of insufficient production. In this regard, microalgae have been well considered as promising sources of n-3 PUFA oil to mitigate the supply shortages. The use of microalgae to produce n-3 PUFA-rich oils has been explored for over two decades and some species have already been used commercially to produce n-3 PUFA, in particular EPA-and/or DHA-rich oils. In addition to n-3 PUFA, microalgae biomass contains many other high value biomolecules, which can be used in food, dietary supplement, pharmaceutical ingredient, and feedstock. The present review covers the health benefits of n-3 PUFA, EPA, and DHA, with particular attention given to the various approaches attempted in the nutritional interventions using EPA and DHA alone or combined with other nutrients and bioactive compounds towards improved health conditions in people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.

Chemical Engineering and Processing - Process Intensification,"Today's manufacturing is based on ample fossil fuel sources, large and centralized plants, and high waste intensity. Climate change, aging infrastructure, dwindling resources, increasing population, changing geopolitical landscape, and the COVID-19 pandemic have laid bare the frailties of the current global supply chain. While there is still place for centralized production, geographic variation in renewable energy sources and sustainable feedstocks calls for a flexible approach towards smaller-scale and more decentralized production. With the pressing need for decarbonization of power generation and the chemical value chain, flexible manufacturing will play a major role in redefining the energy-chemistry nexus. Intensification and modularization are identified as the key enablers for such a transition. A sample case study based on valorization of hydrogen sulfide extracted from sour gas is presented to demonstrate the potential economic favorability of modular chemical process intensification.

INFOR,"Tourism Supply chain (TSC) refers to techniques aimed at facilitating the sustainable development of tourist destinations through purchasing policies and practices. Sustainability is of particular importance to tour operators because their products are dependent on local operators, including accommodations, transportation, and activities. When a tour operator uses a local operator as a channel for reaching tourists, the ecotourism strategies takes on an additional dimension: which party will perform the ecotourism effort to end tourists. Cost sharing arrangement expands the option by decoupling the execution of ecotourism strategies from its funding. However, tourism is typically described as various supply chains in research, yet little is known about their ecotourism effort when considering cost-sharing. We develop a mathematical model for a tourism supply chain under two scenarios: (i) ecotourism effort without cost-sharing and (ii) ecotourism effort with cost-sharing. Using game theoretic models, we compare equilibrium outcomes under cost sharing and without cost sharing scenarios. The results show that the tourism supply chain generate more profit in without cost-sharing compare to with cost-sharing. The results of our study also indicate that the total profit is higher when the local operator performs the sustainability and a portion of the cost of the ecotourism effort is shared by the tour operator. The economic benefit to the tour operator and local operator is higher when both players dedicate their effort to ecotourism individually.

The Digital Supply Chain,"Traceability systems play an important role in the digital transformation of the supply chain. This chapter examines the principal issues on the what, why, and how of achieving digital supply chain traceability in relation to data and technology. We consider the overlapping definitions of visibility, traceability, tracking, tracing, and transparency. We highlight factors driving the need to achieve higher levels of traceability, including regulatory demands, business incentives, and customer concerns and preferences. The emergence of global standards related to traceability is noted. The types of information required to successfully track and trace products in a digital supply chain are explained, as well as the technologies applied to collect, follow, and share information, including radio frequency identification, Internet of Things, and blockchain. The challenges around cybersecurity, standards, data quality, integrating new technologies, and potentially competing interests among stakeholders are discussed. We examine the traceability of wood products, which are important globally and raise significant sustainability challenges.

SAGE Open,Trade governance is important for the efficient implementation of trade policies that support and controls most of the global value chains (GVCs) trade in African countries. Poor trade governance leads to misalignment of trade policies and affects the sustainability of the agricultural commodities supply chains. This study used cross-sectional survey data of 375 randomly selected sugar supply chain actors in Tanzania to evaluate the level of trade governance in Tanzania and ascertain its effects on the sugar trade. Exploratory (factor analysis) and confirmatory (weighted least square regression) models were used for data analysis. The major findings are that governance affects the sugar trade with the magnitude of its effects being felt differently between farmers and traders. It shows further that abrupt trade policy change significantly (p <.05) reduces sugar trade by almost half (47.7%) and lowers the overall level of efforts to invest within the sugar supply chain. Ensuring trade policies are stable and predictable will increase trade by allowing forward contracting and investments.

Although shea caterpillars are one of the most common insect species associated with shea parklands in Ghana, limited literature exists on these caterpillars’ market prospects. With the governments recognizing the economic potential of shea nuts, there have been various efforts to document the shea nut trade in all major shea producing countries. However, it is still unknown what volumes of shea caterpillar trade occur in Ghana. Our study area includes the five key markets that are popular for shea caterpillar trade in the Bunkpurugu-Nakpanduri district of the North East Region of Ghana. This paper uses qualitative and quantitative data collected through key-informant interviews, guided market surveys, and focus group discussions to shed light on the annual trade of shea caterpillars, their supply chains, the value of the sector, and some sustainability concerns.

Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research,"Traditionally, firms often run independent promotional activities to attract consumers and improve their competitiveness. With the rapid development of three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing, a growing number of firms in different markets cooperate to conduct cooperative promotion to meet consumer demand. Different from independent promotion, which means that firms promote their products through their individual promotional activities, when they carry out cooperative promotion, in addition to their individual promotional activities, they also carry out a series of cooperative promotional activities to promote their products. For such cross-market cooperation, it is of importance to consider the unit cost of production and the promotion cost to achieve competitive advantage and sustainability of the supply chain. We develop game-theoretic models to investigate the factors that make firms pursue cooperative promotion and how cooperative promotion affects their optimal decisions. We find that whether or not the firms join cooperative promotion mainly depends on the impacts of price, individual promotional activities, and cooperative promotional activities on demand, as well as the unit cost of production. Whether or not firms are willing to make more contribution to cooperative promotion depends on the difference between the efforts of individual promotional activities and cooperative promotional activities. In addition, as the consumer demand for the product increases, the firms will also increase their investments in cooperative and independent promotional activities. Moreover, as the unit cost of production and the impact of cooperative promotional activities on demand change, pursuing cooperative promotion is not necessarily more profitable than pursuing independent promotion.","Yan K., Hua G., Cheng T.C.E.",Cooperative Promotion of Cross-Market Firms Adopting 3D Printing Technology,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109881382&doi=10.1142%2fS0217595921400285&partnerID=40&md5=b221f7678a108e8e3ecbdf47b081fc55

Sustainable Production and Consumption,"Transitioning to a Circular Economy (CE) is considered the most promising way to achieve economic and environmental sustainability. However, companies and governments are faced with challenges in redesigning existing linear supply chains (SCs) into circular supply chains (CSCs). Although previous research has tried to identify challenges in the implementation of CE in their own specific contexts, the literature lacks a systematic identification and validation of challenges to transition to circular supply chain management (CSCM). This study identifies the key barriers to the redesign of SCs into CSCs in the global manufacturing sector and develops a broad classification to facilitate their mitigation. An extensive review of the state-of-the-art literature on CSCM identified a list of 20 barriers plaguing manufacturing firms and impeding the transition of their linear SCs into CSCs. The barriers were analysed through 200 responses received from experts in the fields of CE and supply chain management using a questionnaire-based survey. The findings of the study suggest significant restraints towards CSCs implementation owing to the lack of incentives and policies, and product complexity. Moreover, the study of the broadly classified barriers such as standardisation and legal barriers, and financial and economic barriers indicate substantial similarities between the results and findings of the extant literature thereby implying significant alignment between the industry and the academia regarding the subject.

Procedia CIRP,"Transitioning towards a more circular economy achieving sustainable business requires both radical change and collective efforts. Succeeding with the development of circular business models means addressing the challenge at hand from several levels including value chain, organizational, process and product. Increased competitive advantage through offering more circular business models are enticing opportunities explaining why value chains collectively address these challenges. At the product level of 'sustainability-by-design', extended product-lifetime is often a first go-to with objectives of achieving increased sustainability or reduced environmental footprint. One challenge is acknowledging and aligning all aspects constituting the product lifetime, this being technical, economic, and actual time in use-where the latter reflect the end user behaviors. Overcoming these challenges requires products that are designed to encourage the customer and end user to take sustainable choice when acquiring the product, during its lifetime, and performing correct disposal at end of product lifetime. This paper reports preliminary findings from an ongoing research project with a case from the Norwegian furniture industry. The objective of the research project is to reduce the case product environmental footprint by 50%. Achieving this objective requires a methodology and mind-set of radical change. As an initial baseline we have conducted a life cycle analysis (LCA) utilizing the SimaPro software identifying the product current environmental footprint. This forms the baseline for questioning specific components, their function and their choice of material and design. The research question addressed in this paper is how to develop circular products and new business models enforcing sustainable behavior both for the manufacturer, its supply chain and the end customer/user? The majority of the furniture supply chain are partners in the research project; hence this paper takes on a view of the design process as a collective process in an industrial context contributing to the sustainability-by-design discussion.","Ellingsen O., Vildåsen S.S.",Developing circular business models: LCA and strategic choice,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133551935&doi=10.1016%2fj.procir.2022.05.275&partnerID=40&md5=fae2e8fea213079b7febf7827517a10e
Environmental Research Letters,"Transparency in global value chains of materials, fuels, and food is critical for the implementation of sustainability policies. Such policies should be led by the G20, who represent more than 80% of global material, fuel, and food consumption. Multi-regional input-output analysis plays an important role for consumption-based assessment, including supply chains and their environmental impacts. However, previous accounting schemes were unable to fully assess the impacts of materials, fuels, and food. To close this gap, we provide an improved method to map key aspects of sustainability along value chains of materials, fuels, and food. The results show that the rise in global coal-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between 1995 and 2015 was driven by the G20's metals and construction materials industry. In 2015, the G20 accounted for 96% of global coal-related GHG emissions, of which almost half was from the extraction and processing of metals and construction materials in China and India. Major drivers include China's rising infrastructure and exports of metals embodied in machinery, transport, and electronics consumed by other G20 members. In 2015, the vast majority (70%-95%) of the GHG emissions of metals consumed by the EU, USA, Canada, Australia, and other G20 members were emitted abroad, mostly in China. In contrast, hotspots in the impact displacement of water stress, land-use related biodiversity loss, and low-paid workforce involve the G20's food imports from non-G20 members. Particularly high-income members have contributed to the G20's rising environmental footprints by their increasing demand for materials, food, and fuels extracted and processed in lower-income regions with less strict environmental policies, higher water stress, and more biodiversity loss. Our results underline the G20's importance of switching to renewable energy, substituting high-impact materials, improving supply chains, and using site-specific competitive advantages to reduce impacts on water and ecosystems.","Cabernard L., Pfister S., Hellweg S.","Improved sustainability assessment of the G20's supply chains of materials, fuels, and food",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126030663&doi=10.1088%2f1748-9326%2fac52c7&partnerID=40&md5=f17b825119fc90fcfe5e8224f786f413
Research in Transportation Business and Management,"Transportation is an indispensable activity for the socio-economic development of countries. However, it is one of the most energy consuming and polluting activities and its environmental impact is expected to increase in the future. As a conse- quence, there is a growing need for managing in a more efficient and sustainable manner this sector. This paper investigates the main issues in developing sustain- able transportation systems with a focus on the European Union, highlighting recent trends to identify the foremost research areas whose advancement will reduce the environmental impact of this sector. Following the European Commission guidelines, three sub-themes are focused: Supply Chain Networks, intermodal transportation of freights, and passenger transportation in urban area. Based on a literature review, each sub-theme is analyzed in terms of needs, barriers, and recent research trends. Some contributions to accomplish the identified needs and overcome the detected barriers are reported as baselines to address the future research agenda. The main findings fit with most of the industrialized countries, that are expected to make more significant reductions in their environmental impact. At the same time, by highlighting examples of good practices and identifying limits to adaptation, this work can also support developing countries in tackling this issue.","Epicoco N., Falagario M.","Decision support tools for developing sustainable transportation systems in the EU: A review of research needs, barriers, and trends",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127613623&doi=10.1016%2fj.rtbm.2022.100819&partnerID=40&md5=8fa9789ccd82429f753864ebae71ba69
Forests,"Tropical deforestation and forest degradation driven by agricultural commodity production remains one of the important sustainability challenges of our times. The responses to tropical deforestation so far have not managed to reverse global trends of forest loss, reigniting the discussion about more robust and systemic measures. The concept of deforestation risk is highly relevant for current debates about policy and trade, and likely to increase in importance in the context of the proposed EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products and EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement. We argue that deforestation is a systemic risk that permeates through different economic sectors, including production, manufacturing, service and control sectors. International trade, investment and economic policies thus act as a systemic trap that cause the production sector to continue with nature’s destruction. This article seeks to more clearly define deforestation risk and uses the case of bovine leather from Brazil to illustrate how pressures for deforestation accumulate across economic sectors towards production, while deforestation risk is dispersed in an opposite trajectory. The article draws on multiple datasets and an extensive literature review. Included are quantitative data sources on annual slaughter, bovine hide/leather registry and annual deforestation, slaughterhouse and tannery locations. We argue that the EU banning unsustainable products from entry and putting incentives for more sustainable agricultural production in the tropics addresses deforestation risks that are currently visible and relatively easy to identify. These response mechanisms are conditioned upon traceability of deforestation risk across supply chains, which is prone to falsifications, leakage and laundry. Although proven to be essential, the proposed EU responses still miss out deeper leverage points to address the systemic drivers of deforestation coming from the manufacturing, service and control sectors that make production through deforestation profitable in the first place.","Mammadova A., Behagel J., Masiero M., Pettenella D.",Deforestation As a Systemic Risk.

Economic Systems Research,"Two frameworks, hypothetical extraction and betweenness centrality analysis, can be used to identify environmentally important sectors in complex supply chains. This study derives an analytic expression for the relationship between hypothetical extraction and betweenness centrality analysis. Second, using the Eora and WIOD, this study analyzes the degree of difference in ‘important’ sectors identified by hypothetical extraction and betweenness centrality analysis. While the results obtained by rank correlation yield similarities, both methods have advantages. This study demonstrates that estimating betweenness centrality is meaningful and less computationally expensive, and can help us to understand the structural positions in the global supply chain network. The hypothetical extraction indicators can be easily computed using the betweenness centrality indicators’ mathematical relationship. We conclude that the implementation of effective CO2-reduction polices through greener global supply chain engagement center around two key sectors, chemical and metal products from China, and their higher betweenness centrality should be strengthened.","Tokito S., Kagawa S., Hanaka T.","Hypothetical extraction, betweenness centrality, and supply chain complexity",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097740891&doi=10.1080%2f09535314.2020.1848807&partnerID=40&md5=05f452d409dc16effc6933c8f9bd0983
Waste Management,"Under the environmental perspective, textiles represent the fourth highest pressure commodity worldwide. In Europe, it is estimated that over 95 Mt of textile waste are generated along the entire supply chain, with still high percentages of textiles addressed to landfill or incineration. The present research, through a systematic literature review on textiles production and consumption, investigates their environmental concerns assessed through the application of the life cycle assessment. Considering the importance of identifying the products’ life cycle hotspots on which actions are needed to reduce the overall impact, the manuscript focuses on the environmental performance related to the cradle-to-grave phases of textile products differentiated by type, composition, and intended use. It results that the production and use phases are those responsible for the greatest share of negative impacts, while the end-of-life generally has a small contribution. Distribution and consumption phases are less investigated, and considering the emerging consumption patterns (e.g., sharing and renting platforms), it seems essential to collect data. Circular practices can bring benefits under the environmental perspective, but in-depth studies are still required to estimate the shift of impacts from one phase of the life cycle to another. Overall, there is a paucity of studies comparing the use of different fibers, ownership models, manufacturing and disposal processes for the same functional unit, or data that would be necessary for low-impact design. The topic is still under-researched among academics and practitioners of the textile industry.","Amicarelli V., Bux C., Spinelli M.P., Lagioia G.",Life cycle assessment to tackle the take-make-waste paradigm in the textiles production,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135373132&doi=10.1016%2fj.wasman.2022.07.032&partnerID=40&md5=f2ac5173f812bbcf7ff9789c46c5239c
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Understanding how training can contribute to employee awareness, development of skills, competencies, and knowledge of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in supply chains and the role of the focal company still remains unanswered.

A review of the literature on the SDGs and the importance of focal companies and training for their execution was carried out in order to theoretically support the study. Then, the case study technique was used to understand “how” and “which” training practices are being implemented in the supply chain to make the management of the SDGs more effective. The results indicate: (i) that the systematic application of training by the focal company is crucial for the implementation of SDGs in the supply chain, (ii) that the focal company plays an important role in leading the implementation of the SDGs in the supply chain, and (iii) that the partnerships between supply chain members are important and facilitate sustainable management in the supply chains.

BioResources,"Until recently, China was the largest scrap and unsorted waste importer in the world. Chinese industries sorted the imported wastes and recovered plastic, paper, textiles, and metals, using them as raw materials for manufacturing processes. Since 2013, the Chinese government has imposed measures to ban the import of wastes, the latest one being the “National Sword” policy (fully deployed in January 2021), banning the import of unsorted and recycled wastes. As a result, collecting wastes and recyclables and sending them to China is no longer an option; this has drastically affected the recycling industry supply chain with considerable consequences. This study analyzed the development of Chinese foreign policies on the export of paper waste materials from the U.S. and their specific impact on the recovered paper recycling industry. The economic and environmental consequences of the policy on the U.S. paper recycling industry were analyzed using three scenarios: landfilling (as a baseline), incineration, and recycling. The CO2 emissions were estimated and then compared. It was found that recycling would result in the largest reduction in greenhouse gases. Although recycling was the best evaluated scenario, it has the greatest costs; therefore, possible solutions towards adding value to paper wastes were analyzed.","Li Y., Zambrano F., Wang Y., Marquez R.",How China's Foreign Waste Ban Will Reshape the U.S. Recycling Supply Chain: Economic and Environmental Considerations towards a Circular Economy Oriented Paper Recycling Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134501507&doi=10.15376%2fbiores.17.2.3178-3201&partnerID=40&md5=533a563e1d28045ec0dc7981ecdc56f5
Transportation Research Record,"Urban logistics is a key step in distribution chains. It implies the use of trucks in congested areas, and generates numerous externalities (congestion, noise, pollution, etc.). Supply chain configurations and consumer behaviors are undergoing deep changes, with a significant increase in the intensity of urban logistics and a diversification of delivery channels within cities. This is an important challenge for city sustainability, as urban logistics is an essential economic activity, and yet the source of intense negative externalities. Numerous directions are currently being explored to rethink urban logistics, such as drones, cargo bikes, crowd logistics, and so forth. However, the economic and environmental relevance of these technologies is not yet perfectly clear. This paper focuses on the conditions for the financial sustainability of cargo bikes compared with electric light commercial vehicles (LCVs). The analysis is based on real data, provided by the parcel service company DB Schenker. The dataset consists of 600,000 operations made in Paris over two months. Operations with electric LCV are assumed to be identical to conventional LCV; the cost comparison is based on a total cost of ownership approach. Operations with cargo bikes assumes that eligible shipments are first brought to micro hubs within the city by electric LCV, then delivered by cargo bike. The numbers and locations of micro hubs are optimized. Results show that a cargo bike solution can be more cost-efficient than electric LCV with a few micro hubs located where the demand is densest, but they can only be relevant financially in those conditions.","Robichet A., Nierat P., Combes F.",First and Last Miles by Cargo Bikes: Ecological Commitment or Economically Feasible?

Engineering,"Urbanization, population growth, and the accelerating consumption of food, energy, and water (FEW) resources bring unprecedented challenges for economic, environmental, and social (EES) sustainability. It is imperative to understand the potential impacts of FEW systems on the realization of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as the world transitions from natural ecosystems to managed ecosystems at an accelerating rate. A major obstacle is the complexity and emergent behavior of FEW systems and associated networks, for which no single discipline can generate a holistic understanding or meaningful projections. We propose a research enterprise framework for promoting transdisciplinarity and top-down quantification of the interrelationships between FEW and EES systems. Relevant enterprise efforts would emphasize increasing FEW resource accessibility by improving coordinated interplays across sectors and scales, expanding and diversifying supply-chain networks, and innovating technologies for efficient resource utilization. This framework can guide the development of strategic solutions for diminishing the competition among FEW-consuming sectors in a region or country, and for minimizing existing inequalities in FEW availability when a sustainable development agenda is implemented.","Zhuang J., Löffler F.E., Sayler G.S.",Creating a Research Enterprise Framework for Transdisciplinary Networking to Address the Food–Energy–Water Nexus,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123729772&doi=10.1016%2fj.eng.2021.08.017&partnerID=40&md5=70b0172f62da602466dbf660eb95274c
Computers and Industrial Engineering,"Vaccine supply chain is a complex system. In the vaccine supply chain, there are lots of uncertainties in the design and production, delivery and demand of vaccines, in particular, with the continuous mutation of the virus, the components of the vaccine need to be updated in time. These uncertainties may result in huge losses to vaccine manufacturer and retailer. Thus, the government often provides the different subsidies respectively to the producing end or the purchasing end in vaccine supply chain so that the members can own sustainability. Motivated by the above, in this paper, we describe the uncertain characteristics of the vaccine supply chain and consider the different government subsidies. We aim to study the production and pricing decision problems of manufacturer and retailer. Late Rebate contract is one of the commonly used contracts in the vaccine supply chain. Thus, we consider Late Rebate contract in this paper and introduce government subsidies, which are divided into three situations: no subsidy, subsidized manufacturer, and subsidized retailer. We mainly explore whether the different government subsidies can improve the profits of vaccine manufacturer and retailer. Comparing the equilibrium profits of subsidizing manufacturer and subsidizing retailer with the benchmark under no subsidy, the conclusions are that subsidizing retailer can improve the profits of supply chain members, while subsidizing manufacturer cannot achieve this effect. The conclusions in this paper provide guidance and suggestions for the government and decision-makers.","Li B., Guo H., Peng S.","Impacts of production, transportation and demand uncertainties in the vaccine supply chain considering different government subsidies",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128387105&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2022.108169&partnerID=40&md5=0ed85afa1d28f1f74d3f952a81a5de54
Mineral Economics,"Various high-purity metals endow renewable energy technologies with specific functionalities. These become heavily intertwined in products, complicating end-of-life treatment. To counteract downcycling and resource depletion, maximising both quantities and qualities of materials recovered during production and recycling processes should be prioritised in the pursuit of sustainable circular economy. To do this well requires metallurgical infrastructure systems that maximise resource efficiency.To illustrate the concept, digital twins of two photovoltaic (PV) module technologies were created using process simulation. The models comprise integrated metallurgical systems that produce, among others, cadmium, tellurium, zinc, copper, and silicon, all of which are required for PV modules. System-wide resource efficiency, environmental impacts, and technoeconomic performance were assessed using exergy analysis, life cycle assessment, and cost models, respectively. High-detail simulation of complete life cycles allows for the system-wide effects of various production, recycling, and residue exchange scenarios to be evaluated to maximise overall sustainability and simplify the distribution of impacts in multiple-output production systems. This paper expands on previous studies and demonstrates the key importance of metallurgy in achieving Circular Economy, not only by means of reactors, but via systems and complete supply chains—not only the criticality of elements, but also the criticality of available metallurgical processing and other infrastructure in the supply chain should be addressed. The important role of energy grid compositions, and the resulting location-based variations in supply chain footprints, in maximising energy output per unit of embodied carbon footprint for complete systems is highlighted.","Bartie N., Cobos-Becerra L., Fröhling M., Schlatmann R., Reuter M.","Metallurgical infrastructure and technology criticality: the link between photovoltaics, sustainability, and the metals industry",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127325485&doi=10.1007%2fs13563-022-00313-7&partnerID=40&md5=bccd5050e0d8db3154544db481857234

The objective of this study is to better understand the current adoption rates and growth potential of emerging Industry 4.0 (I4.0) digital technologies and ascertain their potential to drive successful future sustainability initiatives amongst Vietnamese supply chain firms. These technologies offer a wide range of sustainability benefits, from a potential to reduce waste production and lower energy consumption to increased opportunities for recycling and industrial symbiosis. This empirical study surveys 223 Vietnamese supply chain experts to learn how digital technologies are being utilized in that region, what levels of future investment are expected, what preparatory measures are being taken to leverage new technologies, and what scope for improved supply chain sustainability exists. The findings indicate a low level of I4.0 digital technology adoption amongst Vietnamese supply chain firms, with the Internet of Things (IoT) currently being the most prevalent (48 percent adoption rate). Drones, Big Data Analytics and IoT are the I4.0 digital technologies expected to have the greatest future impact on Vietnamese supply chains.

Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition,"Waste in the food supply chain is estimated to be about 30–40% of the total food production, which aggravates the world hunger and increases waste management burden and environmental impact. Despite the dire food scarcity, majority of this food waste takes place in developing countries because of the lack of appropriate and affordable preservation techniques. Traditional open sun drying is the most popular food-reservation technique to the local farmers due to near-zero capital cost and cheap labor cost. However, this method is highly energy intensive, unhygienic, and time demanding. The high energy consumption resulting from uncontrolled simultaneous heat, mass, and momentum transfer processes in traditional drying systems highlights the necessity of pursuing sustainability in drying process targeting reduced energy consumption, environmental and social impacts. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the sustainable food drying technologies based on renewable energy sources, with emphasis on the developing countries. It was observed that the integration of thermal energy storage with heat pump makes the integrated drying system more efficient, and dries food with better quality. Likewise, advanced integrated drying systems, such as, solar with microwave, and heat pump with microwave make the drying process more cost and quality competent. Finally, impact of resource distribution and governmental incentives for renewable energy use in sustainable drying is discussed.","Qu H., Masud M.H., Islam M., Khan M.I.H., Ananno A.A., Karim A.",Sustainable food drying technologies based on renewable energy sources,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105152255&doi=10.1080%2f10408398.2021.1907529&partnerID=40&md5=d351b189455501274f434fc475c29277
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Waste management directly and indirectly contributes to all sustainable development goals. Hence, the modernisation of the current ineffective management system through Industry 4.0-compatible technologies is urgently needed. Inspired by the fourth industrial revaluation, this study explores the potential application of waste management 4.0 in a local government area in Perth, Western Australia. The study considers a systematic literature review as part of an exploratory investigation of the current applications and practices of Industry 4.0 in the waste industry. Moreover, the study develops and tests a machine learning model to identify and measure household waste contamination as a waste management 4.0 case study application. The study reveals that waste management 4.0 offers various opportunities and sustainability benefits in reducing costs, improving efficiency in the supply chain and material flow, and reducing as well as eliminating waste by achieving holistic circular economy goals. The significant barriers and challenges involve initial investments in developing and maintaining waste management 4.0 technology, platform and data acquisition. The proof-of-concept case study on the machine learning model detects selected waste with considerable precision (over 70% for selected items). The number and quality of the labelled data significantly influences the model’s accuracy. The data on waste contamination are essential for local governments to explore household waste recycling practices besides developing effective waste education and communication methods.

Environmental Management,"Water provision and distribution are subject to conflicts between users worldwide, with agriculture as a major driver of discords. Water sensitive ecosystems and their services are often impaired by man-made water shortage. Nevertheless, they are not sufficiently included in sustainability or risk assessments and neglected when it comes to distribution of available water resources. The herein presented contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6) and Life on Land (SDG 15) is the Ecological Sustainability Assessment of Water distribution (ESAW-tool). The ESAW-tool introduces a watershed sustainability assessment that evaluates the sustainability of the water supply-demand ratio on basin level, where domestic water use and the water requirements of ecosystems are considered as most important water users. An ecological risk assessment estimates potential impacts of agricultural depletion of renewable water resources on (ground)water-dependent ecosystems. The ESAW-tool works in standard GIS applications and is applicable in basins worldwide with a set of broadly available input data. The ESAW-tool is tested in the Danube river basin through combination of high-resolution hydro-agroecological model data (hydrological land surface process model PROMET and groundwater model OpenGeoSys) and further freely available data (water use, biodiversity and wetlands maps). Based on the results, measures for more sustainable water management can be deduced, such as increase of rainfed agriculture near vulnerable ecosystems or change of certain crops. The tool can support decision making of authorities from local to national level as well as private enterprises who want to improve the sustainability of their supply chains.","Schlattmann A., Neuendorf F., Burkhard K., Probst E., Pujades E., Mauser W., Attinger S., von Haaren C.","Ecological Sustainability Assessment of Water Distribution for the Maintenance of Ecosystems, their Services and Biodiversity",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131841904&doi=10.1007%2fs00267-022-01662-3&partnerID=40&md5=5d2ffd9ae3d0fdb3ed95b79f9fc62703
Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"Water scarcity is an emerging threat to food security and socio-economic prosperity, and it is crucial to assess crop production response to water scarcity in large river basins. The water footprint, which considers water use in supply chains, provides a powerful tool for assessing the contributions of water resources within a certain region by tracking the volume and structure of virtual water flows. In this study of the structure of the water footprint network from a complexity perspective, we reassessed the significance of water resources for crop services in a large river basin with a severe water shortage - the Yellow River basin (YRB) of China. The temporal increase of the complexity index indicated that the virtual water outflows (VWFs) from the YRB were becoming increasingly critical to China; i.e. the ability of YRB to produce crops boosted the difficulty of its water being replaced by water exporting from other basins. Decomposition of complexity suggested that during the 1980s to 2000s, the temporally increased complexity was due mainly to the lack of competitors and the increasing uniqueness of crops supporting VWFs.

Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"We are facing the challenge of rapid growth in waste from electrical products (e-waste). In Europe, handling e-waste is regulated by the European Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, which is based on the extended producer responsibility (EPR) model as a regulatory tool forcing manufacturers and importers to take responsibility for their products throughout their lifecycles. However, the directive allows for great variations in implementations in each country, causing e-manufacturers and e-waste handling operators to face challenges in their transition to more sustainable operations. To identify the challenges involved, this study investigates the effect of the WEEE directive from a manufacturer’s perspective. A case study of an e-manufacturer operating subsidiaries in several European countries and the associated producer responsibility organizations (PROs) is presented. The case study includes interviews from 17 stakeholders in 12 organizations in eight European countries. Key findings are as follows. First, the WEEE data reported are not harmonized. Second, the calculations of the environmental fee differ across countries. Third, following up on different national WEEE obligations sometimes leads to over-reporting to avoid negative effects on environmental corporate social responsibility, brand reputation, and profitability. Fourth, outsourcing end-of-life (EoL) treatment responsibility to PROs is seen as positive by the manufacturer but results in a decoupling of the EPR and the operational EoL treatment, which may reduce efforts to transfer to a higher circularity level of its EEE products. Fifth, WEEE is considered a way for e-manufacturers to handle waste not to adopt a circular focus. This paper contributes to both practitioners and researchers within reverse logistics and sustainability by adding knowledge from real-life context of how EPR is implemented in WEEE.",Andersen T.,A comparative study of national variations of the European WEEE directive: manufacturer’s view,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102183972&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-021-13206-z&partnerID=40&md5=4ccfc84683285cca45af5be9ee0979ca
"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","We explore six small-medium enterprises (SMEs) across multiple sectors and their approach towards circular economy (CE) adoption. Our study explores the ‘how and why’ of CE adoption for SMEs, comparing opportunities and challenges around chosen tools and methods. A multi-methodological approach uses interviews, facilitated workshops and tool demonstrations to examine SMEs across agri-food, clothing, carpet, manufacturing and mobility sectors. Making sense of CE adoption means SMEs are observed in the wider context of supply chains, customers, and government/non-government organizations. We find that with some adaptation, current management tools such as value mapping, life cycle assessment, modelling & simulation, and capability maturity can assist SMEs towards becoming more circular and sustainable. Our framework presents a phased transition of CE tool deployment that encourages SMEs to go beyond waste reduction, and connect with social and environmental contexts, capturing value through circular practice from emerging servicised markets, digital technologies, and regional collaboration.","Howard M., Yan X., Mustafee N., Charnley F., Böhm S., Pascucci S.",Going beyond waste reduction: Exploring tools and methods for circular economy adoption in small-medium enterprises,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129403817&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2022.106345&partnerID=40&md5=28acd34635b4533f7aec3f1191374aeb

The effect of market information and agricultural advice provided by the government on the system's outcomes is investigated. A two-stage game model is proposed to characterise this vertical relationship. The equilibrium decisions of the two players under different government supporting cases are derived. We contrast the system outcomes under different cases and conduct comparative analysis. It is found that (1) the farmer cooperative's profit increases if the government provides market information to him and the social enterprise at the same time; (2) the agricultural advice provided by the government can increase the benefits to each participant in the supply chain; (3) to maximise the total supply chain profit as well as its sustainability, the government may choose to provide market information to the social enterprise only; (4) when the wholesale price is intervened by the government or exogenously provided, the social enterprise's social responsibility concern can increase both the farmer cooperative's profit and the social enterprise's social payoff.","Yu M., Chen Y., Yi Z., Wang Q., Zhang Z.",Benefits of market information and professional advice in a vertical agricultural supply chain: the role of government provision,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106269808&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2021.1924409&partnerID=40&md5=3dc219bf3d2fd6e54e74ca5a2fa20a14

We reflect joint and dependent greening efforts for the supplier and the buyer, and devise Stackelberg games for three different channel configurations. Our first case is composed of two stages where the supplier moves first and make her decisions on investment in her greening effort and wholesale price followed by the buyer's effort and pricing decisions. The second case involves four stages where the supplier moves first and decides on her sustainability effort, followed by the buyer's decision on her effort, supplier's wholesale price decision, and finally the buyer's resale price. In the third and final case, there are three stages where both parties select their respective investments in their efforts simultaneously, followed by the supplier's wholesale price and then buyer's selling price decisions. Our analysis reveals that the first configuration is the most attractive supply chain structure for both parties in this context.

Frontiers in Plant Science,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major global commodity and the primary source for baked products in agri-food supply chains. Consumers are increasingly demanding more nutritious food products with less environmental degradation, particularly related to water and fertilizer nitrogen (N) inputs. While triticale (× Triticosecale) is often referenced as having superior abiotic stress tolerance compared to wheat, few studies have compared crop productivity and resource use efficiencies under a range of N-and water-limited conditions. Because previous work has shown that blending wheat with triticale in a 40:60 ratio can yield acceptable and more nutritious baked products, we tested the hypothesis that increasing the use of triticale grain in the baking supply chain would reduce the environmental footprint for water and N fertilizer use. Using a dataset comprised of 37 site-years encompassing normal and stress-induced environments in California, we assessed yield, yield stability, and the efficiency of water and fertilizer N use for 67 and 17 commercial varieties of wheat and triticale, respectively. By identifying environments that favor one crop type over the other, we then quantified the sustainability implications of producing a mixed triticale-wheat flour at the regional scale. Results indicate that triticale outyielded wheat by 11% (p &lt; 0.05) and 19% (p &lt; 0.05) under average and N-limited conditions, respectively. However, wheat was 3% (p &lt; 0.05) more productive in water-limited environments. Overall, triticale had greater yield stability and produced more grain per unit of water and N fertilizer inputs, especially in high-yielding environments. We estimate these differences could translate to regional N fertilizer savings (up to 555 Mg N or 166 CO2-eq kg ha−1) in a 40:60 blending scenario when wheat is sourced from water-limited and low-yielding fields and triticale from N-limited and high-yielding areas. Results suggest that optimizing the agronomic and environmental benefits of triticale would increase the overall resource use efficiency and sustainability of the agri-food system, although such a transition would require fundamental changes to the current system spanning producers, processors, and consumers.

International Journal of Management and Decision Making,"When it comes to the controversy over the environmental and social issues and the rising public awareness, the main pressure is highly imposed on companies by the statesmen and their beneficiaries to go for sustainability. Such environmental and social concerns have competitively directed companies to a point that they feel obliged to place emphasis on green and social items in their procedures. In doing so, the selection of sustainable circular suppliers for the purpose of collaboration is regarded among the critical dimensions of environmental and social affairs. Therefore, this paper attempts to develop a hybrid framework based on fuzzy best-worst method (BWM) and fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) for selecting the sustainable supplier in a circular supply chain. In the proposed framework, the weights of criteria and their sub-criteria are calculated using fuzzy BWM and the interdependencies among the criteria are determined by fuzzy DEMATEL. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed framework is assessed using expert knowledge in an automotive parts manufacturing industry and five suppliers of this industry are ranked.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"When optimizing blending technologies, the main objective is to determine the right mixing ratio of the raw materials, depending on the different qualities and costs of the raw materials available. It can be concluded that research is mainly focused on answering technological questions, and only very few studies take into account the logistics processes related to blending technologies, their design, cost-efficiency, utilization and sustainability including energy efficiency and environmental impact. Based on this fact, within the frame of this research the authors describe a new approach, extending the basic model of blending problems by adding new supply chain efficiency-related components that makes it possible to take logistics parameters related to the raw materials supply (available stocks, batch sizes, transport and storage costs, supply chain structure) into consideration. A mathematical model of this supply chain optimization problem for blending technologies is described including routing and assignment problems in the supply chain, while technological objectives are also taken into consideration as technological objective functions and constraints. The optimization problem described in the model is a problem with non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-hard), which means that there are no known efficient analytical methods to solve the logistics-related supply chain optimization of blending technologies. As a solution algorithm, the authors have used an evolutive solver and a new metrics, which improved the efficiency of the comparison of distances between solutions of routing problems represented by permutation arrays. The scenario analysis, which focuses on the integrated optimization of technological and logistics problems validates the model and evaluates the solution algorithm and the new metrics. Using the mentioned algorithm, the supply chain processes of the blending technologies can be improved from availability, efficiency, sustainability point of view.","Bányai T., Veres P.",Supply Chain Design for Blending Technologies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136384810&doi=10.3390%2fsu14148760&partnerID=40&md5=0ac67d49213462de32f4fd0d60136d1f
Computer Aided Chemical Engineering,"While demand for plastic increases because of its broad application base, the negative environmental consequences of plastic production must be minimized through effective value chain design. Plastic production creates GHG emissions, and its inadequate disposal can generate water or air pollution. Plastic packaging makes up over 40 percent of all plastic made, and within that category, plastic grocery bags have been a focal point for reduction of impacts. This paper explores the types of innovations needed to make grocery bags more circular, i.e., increased recycling and reuse. In similar studies, researchers have used one type of model or theoretical frame to address the question, such as life cycle assessment or economics. In this paper, we use the multi-disciplinary approach of convergence science to address this question. We consider a baseline scenario involving single-use plastic grocery bags, and then explore alternatives from the perspectives of life cycle assessment (LCA), policy, economics, and supply chain management. Integration of these perspective highlights the necessary interdependency of circular innovations needed to bring about systemic improvement.","Dooley K., Thakker V., Bakshi B., Scholz M., Hafsa F., Basile G., Buch R.",A Multi-disciplinary Assessment of Innovations to Improve Grocery Bag Circularity,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136253878&doi=10.1016%2fB978-0-323-85159-6.50104-4&partnerID=40&md5=174e8d53efb6bf888b4930027526b423
Sustainability (Switzerland),"While many previous studies have suggested well‐defined procedures to find appropriate supply chains, a limited number of studies have been conducted with uncertain values relating to transportation costs. Most of these have included only limited detail on multimodal transportation, or have not considered economic, social, and environmental transportation cost factors together. The main purpose of this study is to suggest a multi‐objective stochastic model for sustainable bio-mass transportation, and to identify the impact level of model selection on the transportation mode. It begins with a deterministic formulation of sustainable transportation, which is then modified to a stochastic problem with vectorization of cost parameters. Based on the model developed, we ex-amined four uncertainty cases from a combination of annual capacity and average distance of bio-mass transportation. The experimental results provide more cost savings from multimodal trans-portation, which can be identified if we analyze transportation costs with stochastic modeling. Regarding short‐distance plant cases, the study reveals that the impact of the utilization of stochastic methods is insignificant, as the costs savings from multimodal transportation is trivial. Other findings from the experiments show that multimodal transportation could provide cost savings in the economic cost factor, except in the case of low annual capacity and short average distance.","Ko S., Choi K., Yu S., Lee J.",A Stochastic Optimization Model for Sustainable Multimodal Transportation for Bioenergy Production,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124349128&doi=10.3390%2fsu14031889&partnerID=40&md5=eb5c8b268fdb266a4198be744954c1e3

Technovation,"While the relevance of business and supply chain processes in base of the pyramid context is much discussed, the link to performance measurement (PM) has not been clarified. Focusing on sustainable supply chain performance measurement (SSCPM), this paper provides a literature review to determine which PM tools, instruments, and indicators (PIs) have been used in the base-of-the-pyramid (BoP) literature and how they are associated with sustainability performance outcomes. Exploring SSCPM allows identifying key PIs (KPIs) considering all three dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental, and economic. A structured content analysis on 91 selected papers was performed, and the results interpreted using frequencies and contingency analysis. The core factor driving performance was found to be innovation. The findings suggest that the PIs used in the analysed BoP literature are primarily conventional, leaving a gap in the understanding of the sustainability perspective. The BoP literature also lacks an appropriate PM instrument and discusses predominantly specific indicators of these instruments, showing that research at the intersection of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and SCPM demands further development.

Cleaner Logistics and Supply Chain,"Widespread efforts are being made to mitigate environmental degradation driven by human activities. From a supply chain management perspective, companies aim at improving their environmental and organizational performance along their supply chain simultaneously. Since consumers are the sources of manufacturing companies’ profitability, companies are interested in understanding the extent to which consumers care about their green practices. However, while some consumers would have a higher willingness to pay a premium (WPP) or purchase intention (PI) for environmentally differentiated products, others would not. Moreover, there is scant evidence regarding the integrated effects of intra- and inter-organizational green supply chain practices on green consumerism. Therefore, this study adopts two psychological approaches (i.e., protected values and halo effect) to describe this relationship based on two models that encompass mediation and moderation effects. Data were collected from 351 Colombian university students through a behavioral experiment with three product-based conditions, and the hypotheses were tested using two-instance repeated-measures linear regressions and non-parametric tests. The results indicate that perceived product performance mediates the effect of green supply chain practices on consumers’ WPP and PI (halo effect). Additionally, consumers’ moral orientation toward the environment (protected values) moderates the effects of green supply chain practices on consumers’ WPP, PI and perceived product performance. The study found that people who hold protected values evaluate products better not just for its green attributes, but because of their increased perception of the products’ performance. The contributions are centered on the role of psychological approaches in green supply chain studies to understand consumers’ preferences.","Loaiza-Ramírez J.P., Moreno-Mantilla C.E., Reimer T.",Do consumers care about companies’ efforts in greening supply chains?

Omega (United Kingdom),"With emergencies occurring frequently nowadays, supply disruption has become a potential threat to firms’ operations and supply chain sustainability. To mitigate supply disruptions, downstream manufacturers increasingly provide subsidization for improving supply reliability or implement diversification by employing a dual sourcing strategy. Under either strategy, we consider a supply chain in which a manufacturer with private demand information decides whether to share such information with an upstream supplier, whereas the supplier improves the supply reliability level. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we reveal that the manufacturer may have an incentive to share information with the supplier, and such information sharing can improve the supply reliability. Our results further indicate that when the reliability improvement efficiency is low, the manufacturer prefers diversification. In this situation, with a decrease in reliability improvement efficiency, she also shares the demand information. When the reliability improvement efficiency is medium, the manufacturer forgoes the subsidization and diversification strategies and only shares the demand information. When the reliability improvement efficiency is high and subsidy fraction is low, the manufacturer prefers to provide subsidy to help the supplier overcome the cost on improving reliability (subsidization). In this case, she keeps the demand information to avoid an aggressive wholesale price. We also extend our analysis to the scenario when the manufacturer is allowed to adopt both subsidization and diversification. Interestingly, such combined strategy may even undermine the manufacturer's profit.","Li G., Liu M., Zheng H.",Subsidization or Diversification?

Electronics (Switzerland),"With growing concerns about the depletion of rare-earth elements, managing End-of-Life products has become a key sustainability initiative in the supply chains of global corporations. Recycling, the process of dismantling, separating, and recovery of components and raw materials from wastes, is technologically challenging and should be planned in such a way as to ensure operational efficiency as well as safety. This study explores the Disassembly Line Balancing Problem with Correlated Tasks (DLBP-CT), which is prevalent in the recycling of the Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). For this purpose, an original Integer Nonlinear Programming (INLP) model is proposed to find the optimal configuration for the disassembly lines. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, the Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA) is developed to solve the problem, minimizing the number of workstations and maximizing the relationship between the disassembly tasks.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"With increasing concerns of labor issue risks within supply chains, both academia and practitioners are paying increasingly great attention to how to design and implement effective management approaches to enhance labor sustainability in supply chains. Furthermore, digitalization facilitates and brings both opportunities and challenges to this area. Using the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), we conducted a systematic literature review based on 50 selected papers from the Web of Science database. Starting from the supply chain level, this study identifies digital technology (DT)-enabled labor sustainability management practices, barriers to the adoption of DT in labor management practices, and the performance outcomes of such practices. In addition, we put forward solutions to eliminate those identified barriers to facilitate DT adoption in firms’ labor sustainability management.

Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"With recent advances in the information revolution, Digital Twin, with its complementary technologies, especially Big Data, Internet of Thing (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), is becoming the core of novel strategies to maintain sustainability in Industry 4.0 networks and smart manufacturing. Despite the potential advantages of Digital Twin, such as virtual accessibility, remote monitoring, and timely customisation, not all sorts of enterprises have the resources or capabilities to incorporate such an advanced system, particularly Small to Medium size Enterprises (SMEs), due to their volatile nature of Supply Chains (SC). In this context, a Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)-based, Agent Oriented Smart Factory (xAOSF) framework presents an over-arching SC architecture, with an associated Agent Oriented Storage and Retrieval (AOSR) based warehouse management strategy to help bridge the gap between Industry 4.0 frameworks and SME-oriented setups. This paper presents an approach towards realising the concept of Digital Twin via the xAOSF/AOSR framework, utilising state-of-the-art semantic modelling and analytical industrial tools. An amalgamation of CPS and Big Data Analytics is important to establish an effective Digital Twin to improve system scalability, security, and efficiency. This paper brings attention to this critical intersection and highlights how the xAOSF/AOSR framework can be scaled to implement Digital Twin effectively, which helps in analysing the bottleneck and threshold-states in real-time, especially in manufacturing organisations, which can lead towards full autonomy in an Industry 4.0 environment.","Ud Din F., Paul D.",Demystifying xAOSF/AOSR Framework in the Context of Digital Twin and Industry 4.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138256536&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-16075-2_44&partnerID=40&md5=54aa72564564265b09bcaff55e1056df
Energies,"With rising electricity demand, heavy reliance on imports, and recent economic downturns due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain bottlenecks, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Thailand is suffering severely from energy resilience risks. The government has therefore set a goal of decentralizing energy production through small-scale distributed renewable energy systems. To support their design and the planning process, we simulate multiple scenarios with wind turbines, photovoltaic systems, and battery storage for a model community in rural Nakhon Phanom, Thailand. Using the software NESSI4D, we evaluate and discuss their impact on energy resilience by considering environmental sustainability, economic attractiveness, and independence from the central power grid. To fill the gap of missing data on energy demand, we synthesize high-resolution load profiles from the Thailand Vietnam Socio-Economic Panel. We conclude that distributed photovoltaic systems with additional battery storage are only suitable to promote energy resilience if the government provides appropriate financial incentives. Considering temporal variations and local conditions, as well as a participatory decision-making process, are crucial for the long-term success of energy projects. Our advice to decision-makers is to design policies and regulatory support that are aligned with the preferences and needs of target communities.","Hart M.C.G., Breitner M.H.",Fostering Energy Resilience in the Rural Thai Power System—A Case Study in Nakhon Phanom,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139908887&doi=10.3390%2fen15197374&partnerID=40&md5=b01243c952d992ea9e95e07b86042763
IEEE Communications Magazine,"With the advent of rapid globalization and the interborder supply chain network, the reliability and efficiency of transportation systems have become even more critical. Indeed, trans-continental highways need particular attention due to their important role in sustaining globalization. In this context, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can actively enhance the safety, mobility, productivity, and comfort of trans-continental highways. However, ITS efficiency depends greatly on the roads where they are deployed, on the availability of power and connectivity, and on the integration of future connected and autonomous vehicles. To this end, high altitude platform station (HAPS) systems, due to their mobility, sustainability, payload capacity, and communication/caching/computing capabilities, are seen as a key enabler of future ITS services for trans-continental highways; this paradigm is referred to as HAPS-ITS. The latter is envisioned as an active component of ITS systems to support a plethora of transportation applications, such as traffic monitoring, accident reporting, and platooning. This paper discusses how HAPS systems can enable advanced ITS services for trans-continental highways, presenting the main requirements of HAPS-ITS and a detailed case study of the Trans-Sahara highway.

OPSEARCH,"With the alarming increase in global warming, business activities are being modified by green/sustainable initiatives through immense research. This paper considers a sustainable supply chain which consists of a supplier and a manufacturer. The market demand is emissions-sensitive besides dependent on the selling price and sustainability levels of the supplier and the manufacturer. To maintain the sustainability level of the whole supply chain, both the supply chain entities make investments. The decision behaviors of the centralized and the decentralized channels are compared and a two-part tariff contract is implemented to coordinate the supply chain under the cap-and-trade policy. It is found from the numerical study that the total profit in the centralized system is almost 10% higher than that of the decentralized system. Further, the two-part tariff contract leads to a perfect channel coordination.

Sustainability (Switzerland),"With the development of green agriculture, the demand of farmers for operation loans is increasing. Supply chain finance is becoming a new way to solve the problem of difficult credit in agricultural development. As the importance of sustainability issues continues to rise, there are growing numbers of practical examples of combining agricultural supply chain finance (ASCF) with sustainability, and the attendant risks are emerging. The objectives of this study are first to construct a risk indicator system for sustainable ASCF, then to propose a fuzzy decision method that considers the confidence of decision-makers, and finally to perform a risk assessment of a credit case in the coffee bean supply chain. A combination of the neutrosophic enhanced best–worst method (NE-BWM) and combined compromise solution (COCOSO) is used to evaluate risk problems. The practicality and effectiveness of this research method is verified by a numerical simulation and a comparison with the method. The results show that the credit rating of core companies is the most important indicator. In the context of green and sustainable development, this indicator system is more suitable for the current green transformation development of agriculture and can help decision-makers scientifically and reasonably assess the risk level of ASCF.

International Journal of Production Economics,"With the emergence of the circular economy (CE), conventional supply chains are transitioning towards circular supply chains (CSCs) that achieve improved sustainability performance. Inter-organisational relationships across supply chains need to be redefined to achieve this. We perform a systematic literature review to examine how collaboration may improve sustainability performance in implementing circularity in supply chains. A content analysis has been conducted on 82 journal articles published in the last five years using deductively derived constructs related to supply chain collaboration practices, CE implementation strategies, and sustainability outcomes. Further, a contingency analysis has been conducted to enhance the findings of the content analysis and understand the associations among constructs. Based on the analysis, a conceptual framework is developed to identify appropriate collaboration practices to enhance symbiotic relationships internally and externally in CSCs to improve sustainability performance. Sharing information, penalties and incentives, sharing responsibility for product recovery, risk-sharing, and joint product design are the prominent external vertical collaboration practices advocated for successful CE implementation. Cross-functional coordination and collaboration with government agencies are the most acknowledged internal and external horizontal collaboration practices, respectively. The study reflects that the main focus of CSCs is on improving environmental and economic aspects rather than social performance. The engagement of external parties such as governmental, non-governmental organisations, entrepreneurs, and research institutes complements managerial understanding on collaboration to improve the sustainability performance of CSCs.

Food Reviews International,"With the ever-increasing global population, it is impossible to meet the demand for animal protein by relying only on conventional methods due to the depleting natural resources. It is very challenging to ensure a sustainable supply of animal proteins from a single source or form and requires a holistic approach by using all suitable options. The present review critically reviewed various technological, sustainability, nutritional value, regulatory framework, food safety challenge, and prospect aspects of plant-based meat analogs, in vitro meat, edible insect, and single-cell proteins as suitable candidates for future food security and supply of animal protein in a sustainable way. For in vitro meat, the technological challenge in the supply of raw inputs, large-size bioreactors, and scale-up remains a major issue. Although having a lower environmental impact, the acceptance of edible insects to more comprehensive sections and associated food safety risks remains a major concern. There is a need for uniform and proper regulations of these alternatives/novel foods across the globe, covering various aspects throughout the food supply chain.

This study takes the marine supply chain composed of Maersk and ports in 17 coastal cities in China as decision-making units (DMUs). It then chooses indicators from the three dimensions of economy, environment and society to evaluate the sustainable efficiency of the marine supply chain, Maersk and ports. In order to deal with the uncertain variables of the sustainability evaluation index, this study develops an uncertain network DEA model based on the uncertainty theory, and the computable equivalent form and proof are also provided. In addition, this study divides the decentralized marine supply chain into two modes, i.e., Maersk as leader and the port as leader, and it calculates their sustainable efficiency, respectively. These results suggest that the sustainable performance of ports is superior to that of Maersk, and the sustainable performance of the marine supply chain is better under the lead of ports, but most of the sustainable efficiencies of marine supply chains are inefficient. Therefore, ports should act as a catalyst for the development of the marine supply chain, and the management implications and suggestions for the economic, environmental, and social dimensions are also outlined at the conclusion.","Chi E., Jiang B., Peng L., Zhong Y.",Uncertain Network DEA Models with Imprecise Data for Sustainable Efficiency Evaluation of Decentralized Marine Supply Chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136512990&doi=10.3390%2fen15155313&partnerID=40&md5=352f7ae5b3814ba9786f59872b296366

"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","With the growing concerns of fossil fuel scarcity and its negative impacts on global environment, bioenergy as an alternative energy source has attracted more attention as climate change mitigation. As one of the largest carbon emission and agricultural production countries in the world, China has abundant straw resources and great potential for energy utilization, and the number of straw-to-energy business projects is increasing dramatically. Correspondingly, there is a strong demand to design a stable and sustainable straw feedstock supply chain. However, due to the uncertainty of system boundary and neglect of potential risks, the procurement cost for bioenergy conversion plants (BCP) is varied significantly. Model is a critical approach in strengthening the understanding that leads to promoting supply efficiency. Therefore, an open-source & GIS-enabled linear programming model, named StrawFeed, is proposed to simulate the operation of straw feedstock supply. The costs of raking, baling, loading and transporting have been investigated as components in the StrawFeed model. The model is applied to case analysis of corn straw supply in Nongan county, a major corn production region in Northeast China. The results illustrate that the straw supply cost could be 172 CNY/ton, and the reasonable profit allocation mechanism could achieve the triple-win solution among farmers, brokers, and BCP. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities for optimization are investigated with scenario analysis, based on unique circumstances and supporting policies in China. Unfavorable weather could delay the available working day, and thereby cost would increase up to 13%. The optimized scheme of straw utilization could achieve better environmental and ecological benefits, but the transportation distance for straw supply has to be expanded and the increased cost would be up to 53%. Cross-regional operation of agricultural machinery and machine procurement subsidies could reduce the cost by 18% and 5% respectively. This model is helpful to estimate accurate supply cost and deploy sustainable straw feedstock supply, which could contribute to assisting investors and policymakers for bioenergy industry in China.","Wang S., Yin C., Jiao J., Yang X., Shi B., Richel A.",StrawFeed model: An integrated model of straw feedstock supply chain for bioenergy in China,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132355724&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2022.106439&partnerID=40&md5=ddb8e7761f1a733499596ece76c79647

"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","With the proclaimed advent of Industry 4.0 in supply chains, digitalisation is expected to restructure the ways in which buying firms and suppliers in supply chains collaborate, including on sustainability issues. Digital technologies are expected to foster information exchange and facilitate collaboration on sustainability issues between firms. Yet, there is limited empirical evidence explaining the role of Industry 4.0 in the context of sustainable supply chain management. This qualitative, exploratory study examines digitalisation in the electronics supply chain and its implications for sustainable supply chain collaboration (SCC). We focus on environmental sustainability aspects, such as environmental data analysis and energy use in the supply chain. We conducted 18 interviews with representatives from international electronics buying firms and Chinese suppliers to explore a) how digital technologies are currently used in SCC, and b) which opportunities, risks, and obstacles are associated with digitalisation in sustainable SCC. Our results indicate that a broad range of digital technologies on different digital maturity levels (including Industry 4.0 technologies) are used in SCC, but their use for sustainability purposes is still underdeveloped. Digitalisation is expected by most firms to improve sustainability, e.g., using big data analytics for energy management or easing the transfer of sustainability knowledge in the chain (what we call ""digital environmental upgrading""). We argue, however, that if firms do not prioritise addressing sustainability through digitalisation in collaboration, digitalisation-related sustainability potentials will either not materialise on the firm-level, e.g., due to data sharing concerns, or will tend to be overshadowed by the negative indirect effects of digitalisation, such as rebound effects. We propose three political and managerial levers to enhance the overall socio-ecological performance of the supply chain.","Kunkel S., Matthess M., Xue B., Beier G.",Industry 4.0 in sustainable supply chain collaboration: Insights from an interview study with international buying firms and Chinese suppliers in the electronics industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126876261&doi=10.1016%2fj.resconrec.2022.106274&partnerID=40&md5=e8d7cb90f13bff89630fdfbd56c585b5
Sustainability (Switzerland),"With the rise in online purchases, returns polices have become more lenient to maximise sales, leading to increased product returns. This results in considerable costs to businesses due to complex returns systems, and environmental costs due to unnecessary transportation and waste. Unsustainable consumption poses a threat to our environment, and access-based business models whereby products are borrowed/rented rather than purchased have been proposed as a way to align customer needs, business success, and sustainability. Product returns often constitute a form of informal or illegitimate borrowing, as goods are bought with the intention of being returned. In this discussion paper we propose that, instead of being viewed as a threat to business, issues with high product returns could be seen as an opportunity to switch to an access-based model. As product returns escalate, businesses will need to invest substantially in their reverse supply chains. We propose that a more strategic approach might be to leapfrog the costly stage of developing more efficient returns systems, and move straight to formalising product returns as the new normal for those goods that would best suit an access-based model, so that processes are streamlined around borrowing and returning rather than around sales.","Baden D., Frei R.",Product Returns: An Opportunity to Shift towards an Access-Based Economy?,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122103094&doi=10.3390%2fsu14010410&partnerID=40&md5=5bebfc92f9af80594507179a7e8d8847
Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,"With the rise of digital sustainable business models in the Autonomous Vehicles (AV) industry, the traditional automakers are undergoing a major restructuring in their key performance areas and associated supply chains processes. Focusing on an innovative AV design (AD) concept, this paper investigates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain-based Smart Contracts can enhance sustainable supply chain operations. A novel design element, Margin Indicator (MI), is developed to obtain reliable predictive analytics results from the mainstream machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach supports a robust control of costs and energy, while maintaining a high level of transparency in managing decentralized AV supply chain processes, monetary impacts, and environmental sustainability. Testing the developed concept through a preliminary case study, we observed a reduction in energy wastage and hidden financial transactions by 12.48% and 11.58%, respectively. Supported by the rapid advancement in the blockchain and AI technologies, the developed framework is expected to improve product traceability, transaction transparency, and sustainable economic growth for the AV supply chains.","Arunmozhi M., Venkatesh V.G., Arisian S., Shi Y., Raja Sreedharan V.",Application of blockchain and smart contracts in autonomous vehicle supply chains: An experimental design,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136500537&doi=10.1016%2fj.tre.2022.102864&partnerID=40&md5=38fdebb40fee5a6859d6854aae64427e
Environmental Science and Technology,"With the rising demands on supply chain transparency and food security, the rapid outspread of the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve logistical efficiency, and the rising penetration of sensor technology into daily life, the extensive integration of the IoT in the food sector is well anticipated. A perspective on potential life cycle trade-offs in regard to the type of integration is necessary. We conduct life cycle assessment (LCA) integrated with shelf life-food loss (SL-FL) models, showing an overall 5-fold leverage on carbon reduction, which is diet dependent and a function of income. Meat presents the highest leverage, 35 ± 11-times, owing to its high carbon footprint. Two-thirds (65%) of global sensors (1 billion) engaged in monitoring fruits and vegetables can mitigate less than 7% of the total reduced carbon emissions. Despite the expected carbon emission reductions, widespread adoption of the IoT faces multiple challenges such as high costs, difficulties in social acceptance, and regional variability in technological development. Furthermore, changes in the distribution of transportation resources and dealer service models, requirements regarding the accuracy of sensor data analysis, efficient and persistent operation of devices, development of agricultural infrastructure, and farmer education and training have all increased uncertainty. Nonetheless, the research trend in smart sensors toward smaller chips and the potential integration of machine learning or blockchain as further steps make it possible to leverage these advantages to facilitate market penetration. These insights facilitate the future optimization of the application of IoT sensors for sustainability.","Luo Z., Zhu J., Sun T., Liu Y., Ren S., Tong H., Yu L., Fei X., Yin K.",Application of the IoT in the Food Supply Chain─From the Perspective of Carbon Mitigation,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135194427&doi=10.1021%2facs.est.2c02117&partnerID=40&md5=ac43dae26e199acf652f13b102d8171c
Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"With the technological change and development in recent years, the market shares of li-on batteries, which provide energy efficiency and cost effectiveness, is getting up rapidly. Increasing demand for li-ion batteries used in energy storage, consumer electronics and electric vehicles negatively affects the raw material supply. Materials such as lithium, cobalt and graphite, which have an important place in the production of li-on batteries, are very rare in the market and the countries where these minerals are extracted are quite limited. In addition, many problems arise in the supply chain processes due to the trade policies of these countries. Besides, the environmental and social impacts that occur with the increasing demand for li-on batteries stand out as another problem. In this study, an analytical approach to recycling li-on batteries is presented with a circular economy perspective. With a recycling framework within the current li-on battery life cycle process, we focused on the challenges that arise in this process. From the circular economy perspective, challenges of the recycling process of lion batteries are prioritized by examining their technological, environmental, social and economic dimensions. AHP method is used to prioritize challenges by weighing them over different dimensions. Also, Pythagoras fuzzy numbers are integrated in-to AHP method to overcome uncertainty. In the last part of the study, the results are supported with the managerial implications for li-on battery recycling.","Yıldızbaşı A., Öztürk C., Yılmaz İ., Arıöz Y.",Key Challenges of Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Process in Circular Economy Environment: Pythagorean Fuzzy AHP Approach,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115250499&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-85577-2_66&partnerID=40&md5=284316bdd1d84eabe5ff71e9db844841
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Within the context of the rise of the Internet of Things, blockchain, and other new technologies, telecommunications operators are committed to applying technologies to promote business transformation and upgrading. The government also actively applies technologies to traditional fields to promote social progress. In agriculture, the agricultural supply chain has a low information level and low degree of digitization. The application of blockchain technology in agriculture offers exceptional advantages because of its decentralization, openness, and transparency. Based on the application of blockchain in an agricultural scenario, an evolutionary game model made up of governments, telecom operators, and agricultural enterprises was established to analyze the model’s equilibrium stability and evolutionary stable strategy. Then, numerical simulation was carried out to study the influence of the initial green level, equipment deployment cost, technology operation cost, and other core factors on the tripartite evolution behaviour. The results show that each factor influences the behaviour of a third party in different ways. Finally, according to the simulation results, this paper puts forward practical suggestions, explores the long-term impact of the application cost and sustainable income of blockchain technology on cooperation, and provides new ideas for the governance of China’s traditional fields from the perspective of new technology application.","Song L., Luo Y., Chang Z., Jin C., Nicolas M.",Blockchain Adoption in Agricultural Supply Chain for Better Sustainability: A Game Theory Perspective,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123535202&doi=10.3390%2fsu14031470&partnerID=40&md5=0bbd17889f0a9a0c2e449896ed1c78c4
Applied Energy,"Wood based bioenergy industry is growing rapidly due to climate change, challenging environmental and economic conditions, progress in energy conversion, and development of renewable energy policies. In this regard, an important challenge is employing woody biomass effectively and considering the lower environmental emissions, transportation, and emissions cost of the supply chain and activities needed to convert biomass into a valued energy source. Geographical scale, distribution, and the type of transportation of waste wood cause considerable challenges to meet the economic and environmental sustainability of the woody biomass supply chain (BSC). This study aims to develop an integrated Geographical Information System and Agent-based simulation modeling tool to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the particle-gaseous pollutant emissions and transportation cost of woody BSC. The two main forms of land freight, train and truck, with three sizes of capacity (light, medium, and heavy) are considered for the study. Scenario analysis is conducted to measure the particle-gaseous pollutant emissions and transportation costs of woody BSC. The developed model is tested through a case study in Victoria, Australia. Results showed that a combination of truck and train transport with increasing size and capacity of container leads to a reduction of around 60% gaseous pollutant emissions. Using 80% train transportation mode by suppliers would reduce emissions cost by 58%. Using rail transport emitted higher particulate emissions, and trucks with higher capacity reduced the particulate emissions by 55%. Results also depict that the higher capacity of containers leads to a decrease of at least 50% emissions cost. Harvesting and collection include 50% of total production costs. Finally, the sensitivity analysis results revealed that the factors with the highest impact on the overall transportation and emission costs of woody BSC are those in relation to transport network (i.e., type, capacity, and distance). Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the Australian Government and biomass industry stockholders may apply these results to define and develop plans and policies to contribute towards delivering net zero emissions by 2050. The model proposed in this study can be generalized and adapted to biofuel or other renewable energy supply chains worldwide.","Zahraee S.M., Shiwakoti N., Stasinopoulos P.",Application of geographical information system and agent-based modeling to estimate particle-gaseous pollutant emissions and transportation cost of woody biomass supply chain,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122588837&doi=10.1016%2fj.apenergy.2021.118482&partnerID=40&md5=af2f83c1ad2b68422d2b27cbeafe2688
Sustainability (Switzerland),"Worldwide manufactures are redesigning supply chains, often outsourcing with the aim of maintaining a competitive advantage and gaining market share. When selecting and purchasing fabrics, firms should actively cooperate with suppliers, to meet customers’ needs. In this view, the supplier selection process plays a key role in keeping a competitive edge in global markets. Therefore, this study proposes a multicriteria decision-making model (MCDM) to ease supplier evaluation and selection. Supply chain operation reference metrics (SCOR metrics) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) are combined to build a model for supplier selection. The former allows us to conduct a very thorough fact-based analysis of all features in the supply chain, while the combination of fuzzy theory and SCOR model allows us to deal with uncertainty. The main novelty of this method is that it incorporates a consolidated supply chain management criteria within the framework of fuzzy set theory and multicriteria decision-making model (MCDM) facilitating their application into practice. The proposed approach is tested by considering the case of a manufacturing firm in the fashion industry willing to designate the most appropriate supplier within a set of three potential ones.","Caristi G., Boffardi R., Ciliberto C., Arbolino R., Ioppolo G.",Multicriteria Approach for Supplier Selection: Evidence from a Case Study in the Fashion Industry,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133548721&doi=10.3390%2fsu14138038&partnerID=40&md5=3488c16fe700222f2ceaff927d358687
Energies,"Worldwide, the use of fossil fuels covers almost 80% of the entire energy needs. In the European Union (EU), 2020 represents a watershed: for the first time, renewables were the main source of electricity. In Italy, the latest surveys demonstrate an increase in the use of alternative energy sources. European legislative framework highlights the importance of these new trends encouraging (and imposing) the use of renewables. The necessity to become more proactive in the energy production–consumption process and in the achievement of sustainability targets brings people to create Energy Communities (ECs) to manage their own energy supply chain. The authors present an overview of the main legislative framework in the EU and Italy in relation to ECs, analyzing the energy consumption, the electricity and heat energy production potentiality, and the energy balance in a portion of an Italian middle‐size city in the Milan metropolitan area. Moreover, they underline the technical, regulatory, and planning possibilities to achieve energy independence, exchanging energy among the selected urban district when there is a surplus in production. Lastly, the authors underline the strengths and barriers to the development of ECs.","De Lotto R., Micciché C., Venco E.M., Bonaiti A., De Napoli R.","Energy Communities: Technical, Legislative, Organizational, and Planning Features",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125196919&doi=10.3390%2fen15051731&partnerID=40&md5=fae56d8fb92e7862e4d834de1c042ac7
